TTM Trial Investigators: Targeted Temperature Management at 33°C versus 36°C after Cardiac Arrest
=================================================================================================

Nielsen et al for the TTM Trial Investigators. NEMJ 2013;369:2197-206

### Clinical Question

*   In adults that suffer an out-of-hospitals (OOH) cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause, does induced therapeutic hypothermia targeting 36°C compared to 33°C reduce mortality or reduce neurological deficit?

### Design

*   Randomised, controlled clinical trial
*   Single blinded

### Setting

*   36 intensive care units
*   Europe and Australia
*   November 2010 and January 2013

### Population

*   Inclusion: adult patients who were unconscious (GCS < 8) on admission to hospital after OOH cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause.
*   Exclusion: > 6 hours from ROSC to enrolment screening, unwitnessed arrest with systole, hypothermia < 30°C, suspected or known intracranial haemorrhage.
*   950 patients enrolled

### Intervention

*   28 hours of temperature management with a target of 36°C using invasive or surface cooling, followed by gradual warming to 37°C at 0.5°C per hour and avoidance of pyrexia for 72 hours from randomisation.
    *   4 patients did not receive this intervention as assigned

### Control

*   28 hours of temperature management with a target of 33°C using invasive or surface cooling, followed by gradual warming to 37°C at 0.5°C per hour and avoidance of pyrexia for 72 hours from randomisation
    *   3 patients did not receive this control as assigned

### Outcome

*   Primary outcome: There was no difference in all-cause mortality through to the end of the trial (mean follow-up period was 256 days).
    *   48% had died in the 36°C group and 50% had died in the 33°C group.
    *   The hazard ratio for death was 1.06 for cooling to 33°C (CI 0.89 to 1.28; p=0.51)
*   Secondary outcome: There were no differences between the groups regarding their neurological status (modified Rankin scale or Cerebral Performance Category).

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   This trial does not provide evidence that targeting a body temperature of 33°C confers any benefit for unconscious patients admitted to the hospital after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, as compared with targeting a body temperature of 36°C.

### Strengths

*   Highly relevant clinical question
*   Well designed, pragmatic methodology
*   Objective outcomes assessed by blinded external physicians
*   Intention-to-treat analysis with minimal drop-out / loss-to-follow-up

### Weaknesses

*   Not generalisable to arrests with long or unknown ‘down-time’
    *   Unwitnessed arrests with systole as initial rhythm were excluded
    *   90% had bystander witness; 73% had bystander CPR
    *   Median time to basic life support was 1 minute!
    *   Median time to advanced life support was 9 and 10 minutes
    *   Median time to ROSC was 25 minutes
*   Follow-up was relatively short-term; unclear if 36°C confers long-term neurological benefit or harm.
*   Wide confidence intervals: with 95% certainty, true hazard ratio for 33°C could be anywhere between 0.89 (strong benefit) and 1.28 (strong harm).

### The Bottom Line

*   This trial has not shown any benefit of therapeutic hypothermia at 33°C over 36°C after OOH cardiac arrest. Not everyone agrees this is the same as “36°C is equivalent to 33°C”.
*   My conclusion: if cooling a patient to the conventional 33°C induces unwanted effects, aim for 36°C instead and it _probably_ will make no difference to the patient’s outcome.

Therapeutic Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest With Non Shockable Rhythm (HYPERION)
=================================================================================

Lascarrou. NEJM 2019; published on-line; DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa1906661

### Clinical Question

*   In patients with coma following cardiac arrest with a non-shockable rhythm, does moderate hypothermia vs. normothermia, improve neurological outcome?

### Background

*   The [HACA](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/haca/)
     trial in 2000 reported that therapeutic hypothermia following a VF arrest improved favourable neurological outcome. However a number of patients in the control group developed fever and it was therefore unclear if the reported benefits were from hypothermia or the avoidance of fever
*   The [TTM](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/ttm/)
     study compared a targeted temperature of 33C vs. 36C in patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from a presumed cardiac cause. They reported no significant difference
*   A [sub-study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25629544)
     (n=178) of the TTM trial reported no benefit with 33C vs. 36C in patients with cardiac arrest with an initial non-shockable rhythm. This trial excluded patients with presumed non-cardiac causes of cardiac arrest as well as patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest
*   ILCOR [guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26477702)
     recommend targeted temperature management with target temperature of 32-36C, for all patients with coma following cardiac arrest
*   With the current evidence it is unclear if therapeutic hypothermia is of benefit to patients following cardiac arrest with non-shockable rhythms, including those with an in-hospital cardiac arrest

### Design

*   Randomised controlled trial
    *   Randomised by web-based system
    *   1:1 ratio with permuted blocks of varying sizes
    *   Stratified by centre and cause of cardiac arrest (presumed cardiac vs. non-cardiac)
*   Open-label, blinded-outcome-assessor
*   Follow up at 90 days post randomisation, with semi-structured telephone interview by a single psychologist
*   584 patients required to give a 80% power to detect an improvement in the primary outcome from 14% to 23%, with a 2 sided significant level of 5%
*   Patients with missing data assumed to have died (1 patient in intervention group and 2 patients in control group)

### Setting

*   25 ICUs in France (11 university and 14 community hospitals)
*   Data collected: 2014 – 2018

### Population

*   **Inclusion criteria**:
    *   Age >=18 years
    *   Resuscitated from out-of-hospital or in-hospital cardiac arrest with a non-shockable rhythm due to any cause
    *   GCS <=8 at ICU admission or if sedated GCS score prior to sedation
*   **Exclusion criteria**:
    *   No-flow time (time from collapse to initiation of CPR) > 10 minutes
    *   Low-flow time (time from initiation of CPR to return of spontaneous circulation) >60 minutes
    *   Epinephrine or norepinephrine infusion >1mcg/kg/min
    *   Time from cardiac arrest to screening >300 minutes
    *   Moribund; Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis of liver; pregnancy or breast feeding
*   Comparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group
    *   Age (median): 67 vs. 67

    *   Cause of cardiac arrest
        *   Asphyxia: 56% vs. 55%
        *   Cardiac cause: 28% vs. 27%
        *   GCS at enrolment (median): 3 vs. 3
        *   Circulatory shock: 56% vs. 61%
        *   Duration from cardiac arrest to randomisation: 233 vs. 219 minutes
*   584 patients randomised out of 2723 assessed for eligibility

### Intervention

*   Hypothermia
    *   33C (+/-0.5C) induced and maintained for 24 hours
    *   Each centre followed its standard protocol of internal or external cooling
        *   Intravascular cooling catheter 15.1%
        *   Dedicated closed loop surface device 47.9%
        *   Basic external cooling device with no closed loop: 37.0%
    *   Cooling began a median of 16 minutes post randomisation, stopped prematurely in 12.7%, with nearly half of these being due to suspected brain death
    *   Re-warmed at a rate of 0.25-0.5C per hour to 36.5-37.5C, which was maintained for 24 hours
    *   Sedation targeted Richmond Agitation-Sedation Score of -5. Sedation tapered when temperature >36C
    *   3 patients withdrew consent in hypothermia group and not included in analysis

### Control

*   Normothermia
    *   Temperature maintained at 36.5-37.5C for 48 hours according to the standard protocol in each ICU
        *   Intravascular cooling catheter 14.8%
        *   Dedicated closed loop surface device 34.0%
        *   Basic external cooling device with no closed loop 50.8%
    *   Of note >5% of patients had temp >38C at each 2 hour time interval for first 48 hours – actual number of patients not stated
    *   Sedation given routinely only during first 12 hours, targeting a Richmond Agitation-Sedation score of 0

#### Management common to both groups

*   Decisions regarding limitation of treatment followed current guidelines with a multi-modal assessment of neurological prognosis

### Outcome

*   **Primary outcome**: Survival with a favourable neurological outcome – significantly improved in hypothermia group
    *   Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score of 1 or 2 at 90 days
        *   10.2% vs. 5.7%, difference 4.5% (95% C.I. 0.1-8.9), p=0.04
        *   Fragility index = 1
*   **Secondary outcome**: comparing intervention vs. control group
    *   [CPC score](https://www.emsreference.com/atom/137)
         at 90 days
        *   1: 5.6% vs. 3.7%
        *   2: 4.6% vs. 2.0%
        *   3: 7.7% vs. 10.4%
        *   4: 0.4% vs. 0%
        *   5: 81.3% vs. 83.2%
    *   No significant difference in:
        *   Death by day 90: 81.3% vs. 83.2%, difference -1.9 (95% C.I.0 -8 to 4.4)
        *   Duration of mechanical ventilation (median): 4.5 vs. 4.0 days
        *   Length of ICU stay (median): 4 vs. 4 days
        *   Survival to ICU discharge
            *   21.8% vs. 20.5%, Hazard ratio 1.07 (0.75-1.52)
        *   Survival to hospital discharge: 19.7% vs. 16.8%, (Hazard ratio 0.81-1.74)
        *   Cause of death
            *   Withdrawal of life support: 61.9% vs. 65.2%
    *   Sources of follow-up information
        *   Patient only: 67% vs. 77%
        *   Next of Kin only: 33% vs. 21%
    *   Time from randomisation to life sustaining withdrawal decision, median (IQR): 5 days (3-6) vs. 4 days (2-6)

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   In patients with coma following a non-shockable cardiac arrest, the use of moderate hypothermia improved favourable neurological outcome at 90 days compared with targeted normothermia

### Strengths

*   Randomised controlled trial
*   Blinding of outcome assessor
*   Multi-centre
*   Decisions regarding withdrawal of life sustaining treatment followed guidelines
*   Registered on [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01994772)
    

### Weaknesses

*   There were a number of differences between the intervention and the control group:
    *   The intervention group had temperature management for 56-64 hours compared with 48 hours in the control group
    *   Patients in the intervention group had sedation for at least 30 hours compared with only at least 12 hours in the control group
    *   Patients in the intervention group had their sedation targeted at a RASS score of -5, where as those in the control group had their sedation targeted to a RASS of 0
    *   Time from randomisation to decisions regarding life sustaining treatment was longer in the intervention group
    *   In the intervention group the source of follow up was more likely to be from next of kin only in comparison to the control group
*   A number of patients in normothermia group had temperature >38C. This was not the case in the TTM trial
*   Single assessor of primary outcome
*   Only performed in 1 country limiting generalisability. A number of patients had their sedation stopped early due to suspected brain death. This would not be a common practice at my local institution
*   Low fragility index that was less than both the number of patients that withdrew and the number of patients with missing data

### The Bottom Line

*   This randomised controlled trial reported significantly improved neurological outcomes in patients with coma following a non-shockable cardiac arrest, who were treated with moderate hypothermia compared with normothermia
*   Due to a number of differences between the treatment of the intervention and the control groups, as well as the low fragility index and the significant number of patients who developed a fever in the control group, further evidence is required to confirm these findings

Hypothermia versus Normothermia after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
====================================================================

Dankiewicz J for the TTM2 Trial Investigators. NEJM June 17, 2021 DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2100591

### Clinical Question

*   In patients who are unconscious following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, does targeted hypothermia compared with targeted normothermia, impact all-cause mortality?

### Background

*   There have been several randomised trials investigating temperature management following cardiac arrest
*   The [HACA](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/haca/)
     trial (n=137) and Bernard trials (n=77) published in NEJM in 2002 reported that therapeutic hypothermia following a VF arrest improved favourable neurological outcome. However, small sample sizes and other methodological flaws meant the evidence was of low certainty. A number of patients in the control group developed fever and it was therefore unclear if the reported benefits were from hypothermia or the avoidance of fever
*   The [TTM](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/ttm/)
     (2013) study (n=950) compared a targeted temperature of 33°C vs. 36°C in patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from a presumed cardiac cause. They reported no significant difference in all-cause mortality
*   The [HYPERION](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/hyperion/)
     trial (n=584) showed that in patients with coma following a **non-shockable** cardiac arrest, the use of moderate hypothermia improved favourable neurological outcome at 90 days compared with targeted normothermia
*   The European Resuscitation Council released new [guidelines](https://cprguidelines.eu/assets/guidelines/RESUS-8905-Post-Resus-Care.pdf)
     in March 2021. These suggest:
    *   maintaining a target **temperature** at a constant value between 32 and 36°C for at least 24 h
    *   avoidance of **fever** (> 37.7°C) for at least 72 h **after** ROSC in patients who remain in coma
*   Fever is associated with worse outcomes

### Design

*   International, multicentre, parallel group trial
*   Randomised, superiority trial
*   Co-enrolment with the TAME trial (Targeted Therapeutic Mild Hypercapnia)
*   Randomisation occurred in the emergency department
*   Web-based allocation using permuted blocks of varying sizes (stratified by site + TAME randomisation) in 1:1 ratio
*   Pre-specified secondary outcomes (neurological outcome and health related quality of life) and subgroup analyses (sex, age, time to ROSC, initial rhythm and whether shock present on admission)
*   Outcomes assessed at 30 days, 6 months, 24 months (ongoing)
*   Blinding:
    *   Non blinded clinicians, however assessors of prognosis, participants, outcome assessors, statisticians, data managers blinded.
    *   Duplicate manuscripts were written for each scenario before randomisation was revealed
*   Outcome assessment was by face-to-face interview (72%) or telephone interview (particularly used when the COVID-19 pandemic began). Where possible the patient and a proxy were used to obtain information
*   MRS was performed via a structured interview with interviewers receiving formal training
*   Power Calculation: A total of 1862 participants gave a power of 90% (alpha 0.05, NNT 13.3) to detect an absolute risk reduction of 7.5% in mortality (assuming 55% mortality). This was increased to 1900 to account for loss to follow-up

### Setting

*   Number of countries: 14 countries, 61 institutions
    *   Highest recruiting countries: Sweden, UK, Switzerland, France, Czech Republic
*   Dates of randomisation: pilot phase began late 2017. Active recruiting through 2018 to early 2020
*   Last data collection: 6-month follow-up completed mid 2020 with 24 month follow-up ongoing

### Population

*   **Inclusion**:
    *   Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac or unknown cause
    *   Sustained ROSC: >20 minutes of circulation without need for chest compressions
    *   Unconscious: as defined by the FOUR score motor response <4 and not able to obey verbal command
    *   No limitations to management in place
    *   Inclusion must be no later than 180 minutes after ROSC
*   **Exclusion**:
    *   Unwitnessed cardiac arrest with initial rhythm asystole
    *   Temperature on admission < 30°C
    *   On ECMO prior to ROSC
    *   Suspected pregnancy
    *   Intracranial bleed
    *   Severe COPD with long-term home O2
*   4355 patients screened.
    *   55% not randomised due to exclusion criteria:
        *   most commonly >180 minutes since ROSC, non-cardiac cause for arrest, not unconscious, limitations to care in place
    *   1900 randomised
    *   1861 analysed as intention to treat (39 withdrew consent)
        *   930 in Hypothermia arm, 931 in Normothermia arm
    *   1850 analysed for survival (11 lost to follow-up)
*   Baseline characteristics between groups (Hypothermia vs Normothermia). No significant difference in:
    *   Age (mean 64 vs. 64)
    *   Sex (80% male vs. 79%)
    *   Shockable Rhythm (72% vs. 75%)
    *   Bystander CPR (82% vs. 78%)
    *   Shocked on admission (28% vs. 30%)
        *   Defined as SBP < 90mmHg for > 30 minutes or evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion
    *   Median time to ROSC (25 minutes vs. 25 minutes)
    *   Temperature on admission (35.3°C vs. 35.4°C)
    *   Lactate (5.9 vs 5.8)
    *   STEMI (41% vs 40%)

### Intervention

*   Hypothermia group: target temperature 33C
    *   Rapid cooling achieved by cold fluids and physical cooling devices (surface or intravascular devices).
    *   A feedback-controlled system used to maintain target temperature (bladder temperature probe)
    *   Rewarming began after 28 hours (increase temperature by no more than 0.3°C per hour until 40 hours)
    *   95% of patients received cooling
    *   70% cooled with external devices and 30% with intravascular devices

### Control

*   Normothermia group: In participants who developed a temperature of 37.8°C (trigger), a device was used and set at 37.5°C
    *   Pharmacological and conservative therapies initiated first
    *   Physical cooling devices (surface or intravascular) used if temperature ≥ 37.8°C
        *   Physical cooling devices could be placed prophylactically, but no active cooling was provided for patients who had a spontaneous temperature of <37.8C
    *   A feedback-controlled system used to maintain target temperature
    *   46% of patients needed a device to achieve target temperature (of these 69% used surface cooling, and 31% used intravascular cooling)
    *   In 1st 24 hours ~5% of temperatures recorded at >38C

#### Management common to both groups

*   Normothermia from 40 – 72 hours (36.5°C – 37.7°C) – temperature management could be initiated after 40 hours
*   Sedation mandated in both groups until the end of the intervention period (40 hours)
*   Protocolised step-wise protocol for treatment of shivering
*   At 96 hours a neurological assessment was performed by a blinded clinician – only following this was withdrawal of life sustaining treatments allowed for presumed poor neurological outcome.
    *   Standardised criteria for what was considered a likely poor neurological outcome were used
*   Other than above patients were managed as per clinician preferences. There were no differences (hypothermia vs normothermia) in:
    *   Cardiac catheter rates: 78% vs. 78%
        *   90% vs 87% within 2 hours
    *   PCI: 38% vs. 38%
    *   CAGs: 1% vs 2%
    *   AICD: 16% vs 16%

### Outcome

*   **Primary outcome**: No difference in all-cause mortality at 6 months
    *   Comparing HYPOTHERMIA vs NORMOTHERMIA
        *   50% (465/925) vs 48% (446/925)
            *   RR 1.04 (95% CI 0.94-1.14, p = 0.37)
            *   HR for death in hypothermia group 1.08 (95% CI 0.95-1.23)
*   **Secondary outcomes**: No difference in secondary outcomes
*   Comparing HYPOTHERMIA vs. NORMOTHERMIA
    *   Proportion of people with a poor functional outcome (modified Rankin scale, mRS 4-6) at 6 months: 55% vs 55% (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 – 1.09)
    *   Health-related quality of life: EQ-VAS (patient perception of outcome) (Scale 0-100, with 0 being the worst health, 100 being perfect health)
        *   Mean score 74 vs 75
*   **Adverse events**:
    *   Higher rates of arrhythmias with haemodynamic instability in hypothermia group:
        *    24% vs 16% (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.21 – 1.75, p<0.001)
    *   Comparing hypothermia vs normothermia, no difference in:
        *   *   Pneumonia: 36% vs 35%
            *   Sepsis: 11% vs 9%
            *   Bleeding: 5% vs 5%
            *   Skin complications due to the device: 1% vs <1%

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   In patients suffering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, induced hypothermia did not lead to lower mortality
*   Functional outcome and health related quality of life did not improve from hypothermia

### Strengths

*   This was an excellently conducted randomised trial with large numbers and a superb effort from all involved
*   Design based on data achieved from multiple previous trials meaning a robust sample size calculation and estimate of absolute risk reduction
    *   Mortality in trial (50%) similar to that used in power calculations
*   Excellent internal validity:
    *   Although 56% of those screened seems like a large proportion not to be enrolled, only 1.6% were for unknown reasons
    *   Allocation concealment and blinding of everyone involved except (understandably) treating clinicians
    *   Intention to treat analysis
    *   Clear separation between groups
    *   Near complete follow-up
        *   < 1% missing data on mortality
        *   94% had functional outcome assessed by mRS
    *   Protocolised care minimised variability in practice
        *   Only 3 protocol deviations related to temperature management
*   External validity high due to the multicentre and multinational nature of the study

### Weaknesses

*   Median temperature of 34°C in the hypothermia arm achieved at 3 hours after randomisation. Cooling was not implemented pre-hospital. It is logistically very difficult to achieve any earlier rapid cooling for many reasons (e.g. patients needing to go to cardiac catheter lab)
    *   The trial does not answer the question as to whether ultra-early cooling may be beneficial
*   An ARR of 7.5% was an ambitious difference to achieve, particularly given the TTM results which showed no difference between 33°C and 36°C. However, the authors based this on the original 2002 trials
*   It would be helpful to know exact numbers of patients in the normothermia group who were febrile. A graph is given in the supplementary index but it is difficult to give accurate numbers looking at this graph
*   The trial does not guide our management of In-Hospital-Cardiac-Arrest, so generalisability to this cardiac arrest group is limited
*   20% of patients were co-enrolled in the TAME trial, 10% in each group. This could potentially be a confounder but this will not be known until the results of this trial are published

### The Bottom Line

*   I will aim for normothermia in my patients following out of hospital cardiac arrest. I will implement targeted temperature management if temperature exceeds 37.7°C
*   Future exploration may include a trial of normothermia vs no targeted temperature management

    Really interesting outcome. So proactive TTM is as good as hypothermia and reactive TTM is safer than hypothermia, but I’m still wondering whether reactive TTM is better or worse than proactive TTM? I suppose there’s a cost factor and a safety factor if we can avoid invasive cooling devices in half our patients. So is everyone switching to follow TTM2 strategy until a direct comparison is investigated?

    Thanks for this great summary Celia! I have a couple points which you might wish to comment on?
    
    Your statement, “I will implement targeted temperature management if temperature exceeds 37.7°C” interested me as I presume you mean you will do this in preference to targeted hypothermia, rather than in preference to other methods of targeted normothermia such as that described in the TTM trial. Clearly TTM2 has not compared the two differing strategies for targeted normothermia, and therefore does not invalidate the TTM strategy.
    
    I worry that the application of targeted temperature management in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest remains challenging, particularly outside the context of well-resourced multi-centre RCTs. Given the apparent importance of diligent avoidance of fever, perhaps some of the health system context can be informative? For example, even in this well-resourced trial in first-world health systems 55% of patients were not randomised due mostly to >180 minutes post-arrest. In addition, nearly 50% of patients in the normothermia group needed a cooling device and despite this 5% had temperature >38deg.
    
    In my health service context I will argue that TTM2 does not invalidate the application of the learnings of the TTM trial, in fact it validates what we already know. All such comatose survivors of cardiac arrest should have cooling devices placed prophylactically, and fever avoided through the use of targeted temperature management.

Prolonged targeted temperature management reduces memory deficits at six months post-cardiac arrest: A randomised controlled trial
==================================================================================================================================

Evald. Resuscitation 2019;134(1-9) doi: 10.1016/j.resuscitation.2018.12.002

### Clinical Question

*   In patients that survive with a good neurological outcome following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, does 48 hours vs. 24 hours of therapeutic hypothermia, improve memory, attention & executive functions at 6 months?

### Background

*   Cognitive sequelae are frequent in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Memory is the most common cognitive domain that is affected
*   Targeted temperature management (TTM) has been shown to decrease mortality and improve cognitive function. The optimal duration of TTM is unclear
*   The [TTH48](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/ttm-48/)
     trial reported no significant difference with 24 hours vs. 48 hours of hypothermia in terms of cerebral outcome or mortality at 6 months
*   Hypothermia studies, including the TTH48 trial, typically use crude measures of outcome such as Cerebral Performance Category ([CPC score](https://www.neuromind.cc/coma/cerebral-performance-category/)
    ). More subtle differences may therefore be missed

### Design

*   Predefined post-hoc study of the randomised open-label [TTH48](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/ttm-48/)
     trial
*   Patients invited to neuropsychological assessment of memory, attention, executive function at 6 months
*   Blinding of outcome assessor
*   Estimate of pre-morbid intelligence assessed by [WAIS-IV Vocabulary test](https://wechsleriqtest.com/wechsler-adult-intelligence-scale/)
     to control for pre-morbid level of cognitive function
*   13 cognitive tests assessed. Patient considered to be cognitively impaired if their performance was below the cut-off score for 3 or more tests

### Setting

*   Two university hospitals in Denmark & Norway (Original TTH48 trial included 10 units)
*   Original TTH48 trial conducted from 2013-2016

### Population

*   **Inclusion criteria**:
    *   Enrolled in [TTH48](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/ttm-48/)
         trial
    *   Good cognitive function prior to cardiac arrest: CPC score <=2
    *   Good cognitive outcome at 6 months: CPC score <=2
*   **Exclusion**: as per TTH48 trial
*   79 patients included in the study out of 111 eligible patients. 355 patients were originally enrolled in TTH48 study
*   No significant differences between intervention and control groups, or between study participants and patients lost to follow up:
    *   Comparing TTM24 (n=36) vs. TTM48 (n=43):
        *   Male: 94% vs. 86%
        *   CPC 1: 81% vs. 70%
        *   Basic CPR: 86% vs. 91%
        *   Shockable rhythm: 94% vs. 95%
        *   Age: 58 vs. 57
        *   Minutes to ROSC: 18 vs. 18
        *   Days since OHCA: 187 vs. 188
        *   Vocabulary (WAIS-IV): 27 vs. 31

### Intervention

*   Prolonged TTM for 48 hours

### Control

*   Standard TTM for 24 hours

#### Management common to both groups

*   Temperature controlled to 33C+-1C

### Outcome

*   Unadjusted multivariate regression, comparing control group vs. intervention group treatment effect (positive treatment effect number indicates improved outcome in TTM48 group, except for trail making tests where negative number indicates improved outcome in TTM48 group):
    *   No significant difference in:

        *   ROCFT recognition – no significant difference
            *   19.83 vs. 0.10
*   Multi-variate regression analysis adjusted for age and time to ROSC revealed slightly stronger association of TTM48 with significant differences in the same 3 memory tests
*   Overall cognitive impairment – **significantly greater in TTM24 group**
    *   33% vs. 12%, relative risk ratio 2.9 (95% C.I. 1.1-7.4), NNT 4.6

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   In patients with perceived good cognitive outcome, 48 hours of therapeutic hypothermia was associated with reduced memory deficits and cognitive impairment at 6 months, compared with 24 hours of therapeutic hypothermia

### Strengths

*   Blinding of outcome assessor
*   Controlled for level of pre-morbid cognitive function
*   Pre-defined analysis of randomised controlled trial
*   Multi-centre
*   Patient orientated outcomes

### Weaknesses

*   Post-hoc analysis
*   Nearly 30% of patients lost to follow up
*   Small numbers in each group
*   Only included patients with perceived good cognitive outcome
*   Although not statistically significant, patients in TTM24 group were less likely to participate in the study, and had a higher rate of a CPC 1 score
*   Multiple cognitive tests assessed with no primary outcome – increased probability of type 1 error
*   ROCFT recognition trial had a number of missing values
*   Only 2 institutions completed this study out of the 10 that were included in the TTH48 trial

### The Bottom Line

*   This pre-planned post-hoc analysis of the [TTH48 trial,](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/ttm-48/)
     reported that in patients with an out of hospital cardiac arrest who were treated with 48 hours of therapeutic hypothermia vs. 24 hours had significantly reduced memory deficits at 6 months
*   Due to the methodological weaknesses further trials are warranted before this becomes standard practice
*   Future trials assessing cognitive function post cardiac arrest should, as this trial did, include more detailed assessments than CPC scores

HACA: Mild Therapeutic Hypothermia to Improve the Neurologic Outcome after Cardiac Arrest
=========================================================================================

The HACA Study Group. N Engl J Med 2000; 346:549-556

### Clinical Question

*   In adults who suffer cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, does mild hypothermia compared with standard normothermia improve neurological outcome at 6 months?

### Design

*   Randomised, controlled trial
*   Blinded assessment of the outcome
*   Computer generated ‘sealed envelope’ randomisation in blocks of 10, stratified by medical centre

### Setting

*   Nine centres in five European countries
*   March 1996 to January 2001
*   Stopped before full recruitment due to lower than expected enrollment rate and funding shortage

### Population

*   Inclusion: 18 – 75 year olds; witnessed cardiac arrest; pulseless VT or VF as initial rhythm.
*   Exclusion: longer than 15 minutes before advanced life support; longer than 60 minutes before ROSC; responsive after ROSC; prolonged hypotension after ROSC (30 minutes at MAP < 60 mmHg); hypoxaemia for more than 15 minutes after ROSC; cardiac arrest after medical support already present
*   3551 assessed of which 275 randomised

### Intervention

*   137 patients
*   Induced hypothermia targeting 32–34°C using surface cooling (cold air blanket or ice packs) for 24 hours, followed by passive re-warming
*   Sedation and shiver-management was protocolised: midazolam, fentanyl and pancuronium
    *   Median time from ROSC to initiation of cooling was 105 minutes \[IQR 61–192\]
    *   Median time from ROSC to target temperature was 8 hours \[IQR 4–16\]
    *   12% failed to reach target temperature

### Control

*   128 patients
*   Standard hospital bed with no temperature management
*   Sedation protocol as per intervention arm
    *   Diagrammatic data suggests median temperature was 37.5°C or higher from ~12 hours onward

### Outcome

*   Primary outcome: more patients in the hypothermia group were left with good neurological outcomes at six months
    
    *   Good neurological outcome assessed as Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories 1 \[no disability\] or 2 \[mild disability\]
    *   Bad neurological outcome assessed as P-CPC 3 \[severe disability\], 4 \[persistent vegetative state\] or 5 \[death\]
    
    *   75 (55%) versus 54 (39%) had favourable neurological outcomes, favouring hypothermia
    *   Risk ratio for death in normothermia group was 1.40 (95% CI 1.08–1.81).
    *   Number-needed-to-treat was 6 (95% CI 4–25)
    *   Secondary outcome: a difference in mortality favoured the hypothermia group

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   Among patients in whom spontaneous circulation has been restored after cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, systemic cooling to a bladder temperature of 32–34°C for 24 hours increases the chance of a favourable neurological outcome, as compared to standard normothermic life support

### Strengths

*   Randomised trial with blinded assessment.
*   First clinical trial testing theory drawn from cohort and animal studies.

### Weaknesses

*   Narrow inclusion criteria limit generalisability
*   Minor baseline differences between groups, but no change in risk ratio after statistical correction
*   Attending physician not blinded, which may bias toward a positive outcome
*   Blinding of assessing physician not verified, but relatively objective outcome assessment should limit impact of any accidental un-blinding
*   Only 8% of screened patients were included; selection bias cannot be excluded
*   Control group became hyperthermic, which may be harmful. Difference observed could be due to harm of conventional therapy rather than benefit of hypothermic therapy

### The Bottom Line

*   In patients who suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to VT or VF, and where resuscitation efforts are quickly commenced, and when ROSC has been achieved within 1 hour, therapeutic hypothermia targeting 32–34°C will improve the chance of a favourable outcome and should be implemented. The results of this trial now need to be reviewed in light of TTM.
