On the basis of these studies I will not use steroids as routine for patients with septic shock due to the potential side effects. However in patients that are not responding to treatment and are at high risk of death, I will continue to use steroids as some benefits have been reported. I will not base my decision on the corticotrophin result as other studies have reported a number of limitations with using this test in critically ill patients. I eagerly await the results of the ADRENAL study which will hopefully allow a more evidenced based decision to be made.\n",

      "Does treatment with vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine lead to a more rapid resolution of septic shock compared with hydrocortisone alone?\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection\n",
      "A study published in the Lancet shows that in 2017, an estimated 48·9 million incident cases of sepsis were recorded worldwide and 11·0 million sepsis-related deaths were reported, representing 19·7% of all global deaths\n",
      "High-dose intravenous (IV) vitamin C has recently been explored as an adjunctive therapy in sepsis because of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. An RCT (Fowler, 2014) of 24 patients showed that high-dose IV vitamin C attenuated organ failure associated with sepsis in a dose-dependent manner. Thiamine deficiency has also been reported in 20% of critically ill patients with sepsis (Donnino 2010), and thiamine supplementation has been shown to improve lactate clearance in patients with sepsis (Woolum 2018)\n",
      "The combination of high-dose IV vitamin C and hydrocortisone together with thiamine was assessed in a single-center retrospective before-and-after study of 94 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (Marik 2017). The intervention was associated with shorter duration of vasopressor administration and lower hospital mortality\n",
      "\n",
      "Design\n",
      "\n",
      "Pilot, feasibility, multi-centre, randomised, open-label, phase IIb clinical trial\n",
      "Random allocation sequence was generated at the coordinating center using computer-generated random numbers with permuted block sizes of 2, 4, and 6 in a 1:1 ratio stratified by site\n",
      "Sample size was initially calculated from a retrospective before and after study with 126 patients required based on an SD of 42 vasopressor-free hours up to day 7. This was then updated from the pooled SD for the first 60 patients enrolled in the study, and the required sample size was recalculated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on an updated SD of 51.6 hours, the study was estimated to require 180 patients to have 90% power (2-sided α = .05) to detect a difference in vasopressor-free hours of 25\n",
      "As the distribution of the primary outcome was expected to be nonparametric, and nonparametric tests have been shown to have decreased statistical power compared with parametric tests, the sample size was inflated by 15% (189 patients). Finally, to account for consent withdrawal (5%), a total of 216 patients were planned to be enrolled.\n",

      "\n",
      "Time alive and free of vasopressors meant the patient was alive at discontinuation of all intravenous vasopressors for at least 4 hours in the presence of a MAP>65 mmHg or target MAP set by treating physicians. If a patient died while receiving vasopressor therapy following the index episode of septic shock, the patient was assigned zero hours for this outcome. If a patient was weaned from all vasopressors for 4 consecutive hours, then all of the remaining time through day 7 was treated as success, even if the patient died or had vasopressors restarted after weaning within the 7-day period\n",
      "Use of vasopressors defined as any use of norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, (*metaraminol, dopamine, or phenylephrine). Total vasopressor doses was calculated as the sum of norepinephrine doses and epinephrine and vasopressin doses were converted to equivalent norepinephrine doses. *Patients receiving metaraminol monotherapy did not contribute to total vasopressor dose data, and no patients received dopamine or phenylephrine\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondary outcomes: Of 10 pre-specified secondary outcomes, only one (change in SOFA score at day 3) showed a statistically significant difference\n",
      "Adverse Events: reported for 2 patients (2 events, fluid overload and hyperglycemia) in the intervention group and 1 patient (1 event, gastrointestinal bleeding) in the control group. No serious adverse events or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions were reported\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Authors’ Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "In patients with septic shock, treatment with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine, compared with intravenous hydrocortisone alone, did not significantly improve the duration of time alive and free of vasopressor administration over 7 days. The finding suggests that treatment with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine does not lead to a more rapid resolution of septic shock compared with intravenous hydrocortisone alone\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinically important question with relevant patient outcomes measured\n",
      "A priori publication of trial protocol and statistical analysis plan\n",
      "Reason for a change in sample size based on power analysis is clearly explained in the manuscript\n",
      "Conducted at 10 sites including high and middle-income countries\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "Open label and lacked blinded outcome assessment, thus creating the possibility of performance and ascertainment bias\n",
      "Effects of vitamin C and thiamine were not assessed separately\n",
      "Thiamine levels were not measured in the trial, making it uncertain whether randomised patients did or did not have thiamine hypovitaminosis at randomisation and whether this was corrected\n",
      "Target MAP set for each patient by treating clinicians was not collected\n",
      "Trial was underpowered to detect differences in mortality or other patient-centered outcomes\n",
      "Adverse events were reported only when treating clinicians adjudicated, and patients were not systematically examined for other possible adverse effects (eg, oxaluria) that might develop with high-dose IV vitamin C\n",
      "There is no data relating to fluid balance or cardiac output monitoring which may have influenced vasopressor requirement\n",
      "Time to the administration of antibiotics was not collected\n",
      "The median time from ICU admission to randomisation was 12 hours. Even if delays presenting to Emergency Department and transferring to ICU are not taken into account, this delay may have reduced drug efficacy\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "I will continue my current practice which is not to use the HAT (hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid and thiamine) protocol for treating septic shock\n",
      "Further studies looking at timing of treatment intervention may be helpful although the unintended consequences of diverting funding from other research opportunities in sepsis and other diseases must also be considered. Completion of several existing trials will hopefully provide the information we need\n",
      "Whilst we continue our search for the elusive magic bullet for sepsis we must not lose focus on interventions that we know are life saving: the right antibiotics given early, together with antimicrobial stewardship, source control, and optimal  physiological support\n",

      "In patients with septic shock who are treated with corticosteroids, does tight glycaemic control (4.44–6.1 mmol/l) compared with less-tight glycaemic control (<8.3 mmol/l) reduce in-hospital mortality?\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Septic shock is a characterised by a dysregulated host response to an infection including hypotension that is not corrected by fluid administration alone\n",
      "The administration of corticosteroids (hydrocortisone in particular) is thought to attenuate this response and evidence suggests that it reduces the degree of hypotension although it may not ultimately prevent death\n",
      "A consequence of corticosteroid administration is dysregulation of glucose control, which may be harmful\n",
      "It is possible that intensive insulin therapy, with the aim of tight serum glucose control within normal physiological parameters, may counteract some of the harm from corticosteroids allowing them to be more beneficial in patients with septic shock\n",

      "\n",
      "This trial provides no evidence to support intensive insulin therapy (blood glucose target 80 to 110 mg/dl [4.44 to 6.1 mmol/l] ) for patients with septic shock being treated with corticosteroids\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis is reasonable given the described theory (but note comment in Weaknesses below), and the randomised, controlled trial design is arguably the best method to investigate this hypothesis\n",
      "The multi-centre design increases external generalisation\n",
      "The centralised, web-based randomisation process is the gold standard for concealing group allocation and preventing allocation bias\n",
      "The power calculation was based on previous data, although in retrospect it was over optimistic to expect the intervention to reduce mortality by 25%\n",
      "The statistical methods and intention-to-treat analysis plan were appropriate for the data types\n",
      "Attempts were made to standardise non-study care according to published guidelines, which may reduce any ascertainment bias due to the lack of blinding, although the compliance with this was not reported\n",
      "Good separation was demonstrated between the groups with regards to blood glucose levels, increasing the internal validity of the results\n",
      "The primary outcome is objective and binary, reducing observer bias and simplifying assessment and analysis\n",
      "The small confidence intervals around the null-effect point suggest that a true benefit or harm is unlikely, which strengthens the conclusion of this trial\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis tested tight glucose control with a target of 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/l against less-tight glucose control with a target of < 8.3 mmol/l, which are arguably not that dissimilar and perhaps the theory has not been adequately tested with this trial\n",
      "\n",
      "Compare this with NICE-SUGAR‘s relaxed glucose control with a target of 8.0 to 10.0 mmol/l\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The open-label design may introduce significant biases as clinical staff may unconsciously treat the patients differently depending upon their group allocation, which usually exaggerates the effect in favour of the intervention group\n",
      "The time-frame for the primary outcome – in-hospital events – introduces the possibility of distortion of the results due to ‘clipping’\n",
      "\n",
      "If patients get home but still die more often then this significant outcome will be missed\n",
      "30-day mortality is frequently used for a fairer assessment of outcome but this requires more trial resource to follow-up discharged patients\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "This trial provides evidence against Intensive Insulin Therapy in patients administered hydrocortisone for septic shock, and furthermore there is no benefit from additional fludrocortisone\n",
      "The narrow confidence intervals suggest that any true benefit is small and this must be balanced against the significant incidence of hypoglycaemia (NNH 12)\n",
      "This adds to the theory regarding steroids in sepsis – if they are of benefit, counteracting the possibly harmful hyperglycaemia with tight glycaemic control does not make any difference to short-term patient outcomes compared to less-tight glycaemic control\n",

      "In critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury, does accelerated initiation of renal replacement therapy compared to standard initiation improve 90 day survival?\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and some case series suggest up to 2/3rds of ICU patients develop some degree of renal impairment. Up to 50% of these patients may need dialysis which increases the complexity and cost of the care of the critically ill. Patients with critical illness and AKI have a high mortality.\n",
      "The purported rationale for early dialysis include: achieving optimal fluid balance via ultrafiltration, removal of toxic solutes that may mitigate the inflammatory milieu and correcting metabolic acidosis that may contribute to haemodynamic instability\n",
      "The purported rationale for delaying dialysis include: less procedural related risk to the patient, avoidance in some situations of an unnecessary intervention if the patient’s renal function improves spontaneously, resource rationing and avoidance of iatrogenic hypovolaemia from excessive ultrafiltration.\n",
      "Previously, there have been several trials conducted exploring the optimal timing of renal replacement therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AKIKI trial looked at a predominantly medical cohort of patients with AKI & consequent metabolic derangement, and randomised them to early or late dialysis. At Day 60, there was no difference in mortality. Patients in this trial could receive intermittent or continuous dialysis.\n",
      "The ELAIN trial looked at a predominantly surgical cohort of patients with AKI (KDIGO stage 3) and randomised to early or late dialysis. The hazard ratio of death at day 90 was 0.66 in favour of the early initiation strategy (95% CI 0.45 to 0.97; p-value = 0.03). However, the fragility of this trial was 3.\n",

      "\n",
      "In adult critically ill patients, with acute kidney injury, does early initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) compared to delayed initiation of RRT reduce the composite endpoint of MAKE365; consisting of death, RRT and persistent renal dysfunction at one year?\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "The optimal timing for initiation of RRT in patients with AKI is unknown.\n",
      "This trial looked at the 1 year outcomes of patients enrolled in the ELAIN trial.\n",
      "The ELAIN trial examined 90 day mortality of patients who were randomised to receive early RRT (within 8 hours of reaching KDIGO Stage 2) or delayed RRT (within 12 hours of reaching KDIGO Stage 3) or if they had an absolute indication for initiation of RRT.\n",
      "The ELAIN trial showed improved 90 day mortality (early vs delayed RRT) of 39.3% vs 54.7%, shorter duration of RRT (9 days vs 25 days), reduced ventilator time (125 hrs vs 181 hrs) and reduced hospital LOS (51 days vs 82 days).\n",
      "This trial aimed to determine if the beneficial intervention of early RRT was sustained at the 1 year mark.\n",
      "It is known that the mortality and morbidity after receiving RRT in ICU is high. For example, the POST-RENAL (prolonged outcomes after kidney injury requiring dialysis in the ICU) study suggested that at 4 years more than 60% of patients who had received dialysis in ICU were now dead and more than 5% of those who survived required ongoing dialysis.\n",
      "The STAART-AKI trial is currently recruiting. This trial is larger than ELAIN as it is aiming to recruit 2866 patients (vs 231 for ELAIN). It is comparing early RRT vs standard care. This study includes ICU adults with renal dysfunction who have i) A doubling of baseline creatinine OR ii) Cr >354umol/L OR iii) UO<0.5ml/kg/hr for 12 hours. The primary outcome is 90 day mortality and independence from RRT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Design\n",
      "\n",
      "The ELAIN trial was randomised, unblinded, single-centre with complete follow-up. Patients were allocated 1:1 for early vs late dialysis stratified by hemodynamic SOFA score.\n",
      "For patients discharged alive at 90 days, telephone calls were made to the general practitioner, subject or family member to determine if the patient was alive, if they were requiring RRT or if they had persistent renal dysfunction (defined as 25% decline in eGFR compared with baseline calculated with the Cockroft-Gault formula)\n",

      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary outcome is a serum biomarker, rather than a patient-centred outcome. The clinically meaningful outcomes that were measured, as secondary outcomes (e.g. need for renal replacement therapy, death) were similar between groups\n",
      "Most of the signal of benefit in this trial came from reduction in Stage 1 AKI – it is unclear if the amino acids just improve the numbers or if they truly protect the kidneys\n",
      "The observed rate of RRT is lower in the amino acid group (although not statistically significant) but this could reflect a lack of power because RRT is a relatively rare event. If this was translated to a larger population, this could be globally important\n",
      "An economic analysis would be helpful\n",
      "The supplementary material gives outcomes at Day 30, 90 and 180 for serum creatinine levels. There is no difference between groups, suggesting no benefit of amino acid infusion on long term renal function.\n",

      "\n",
      "This trial shows that amino acids reduce acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass\n",
      "However, most of the signal comes from a reduction in AKI Stage 1, and as this biomarker is not a clinically meaningful outcome, I will not change my practice at this stage\n",

      "\n",
      "In adults with out of hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) due to a presumed cardiac cause, who are post ‘return of spontaneous circulation’ (ROSC), does cooling to 33°C for 48 hours, compared with 24 hours, improve improved neurological outcomes at 6 months?\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Therapeutic cooling was established as an intervention for OOHCA patients and ROSC with the perceived benefit of reducing cerebral oxygen demand.\n",
      "In the wake of the Targeted Temperature Management (TTM) trial, current guidelines, including the most recent European Resuscitation Council guidelines, now recommend TTM between 32-36°C, rather than the previously recommended 32-34°C(1).\n",
      "While current guidelines also recommend a minimum duration of 24hrs for TTM, this recommendation in itself is low quality evidence and is primarily based on the protocol undertaken in what are considered the two largest and better quality RCTs in this area.\n",
      "These trials were not however designed to look at duration of cooling specifically.\n",
      "Although previous observational studies comparing 24 to 72 hours of hypothermia in OOHCA patients have failed to show any difference in mortality, randomized control trial (RCT) data looking at optimal periods of cooling as related to long term neurological outcomes is lacking and the optimal duration for cooling to any temperature, within the temperature bracket of 32-36°C remains poorly evidenced based.\n",

      "\n",
      "The authors conclude that this study did not show a difference for primary outcome, however they feel that their study may have had limited power to detect what may be a clinical important difference and suggest further research may be warranted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "Multicentre randomised trial across ten hospitals\n",
      "Objective neurological assessment carried out by a blinded assessor\n",
      "The primary outcome was highly relevant to patients (i.e based on functional outcome)\n",
      "Protocol was designed with the intention of being pragmatic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors point out that because sample size was calculated using a 15% absolute difference, the risk of type 2 error is increased. A trial to elucidate if the 5% difference in primary outcome detected could be significant would require approximately 10-fold more patients.\n",
      "60% of all OOHCA all patients were excluded from this trial and an upper age limit of 80 years was placed for inclusion. This limits the external validity.\n",
      "The study protocol was written before the TTM trial was published. A 3rd group with temperature maintained at 36C for 48 hours would have been useful\n",
      "In both the intervention and the control groups, following completion of the targeted temperature management, ~50% of patients had a temperature of >37C. Therefore this study could not tell us if any differences reported were from prolonged therapeutic hypothermia or the avoidance of pyrexia.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "In patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac origin, this study reported that maintaining temperature at 33 degrees for 24 vs 48 hours resulted in no significant difference in neurologic outcome.\n",
      "If we consider adverse outcomes and implications for distributions of resources, these results may also point toward possible disadvantages to cooling for more than 24 hours.\n",
      "My current practice is to use targeted temperature management to a target of 36C for 30 hours followed by avoidance of pyrexia for 24-48 hours. Based on this study I will not change this practice.\n",
      "Hopefully the outcome of TTM2 will help shed some further light on best evidence based practice in this area\n",

      "Clinical Question\n",
      "\n",
      "In adult critically ill patients, with acute kidney injury, does early initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) compared to delayed initiation of RRT reduce the composite endpoint of MAKE365; consisting of death, RRT and persistent renal dysfunction at one year?\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "The optimal timing for initiation of RRT in patients with AKI is unknown.\n",
      "This trial looked at the 1 year outcomes of patients enrolled in the ELAIN trial.\n",
      "The ELAIN trial examined 90 day mortality of patients who were randomised to receive early RRT (within 8 hours of reaching KDIGO Stage 2) or delayed RRT (within 12 hours of reaching KDIGO Stage 3) or if they had an absolute indication for initiation of RRT.\n",
      "The ELAIN trial showed improved 90 day mortality (early vs delayed RRT) of 39.3% vs 54.7%, shorter duration of RRT (9 days vs 25 days), reduced ventilator time (125 hrs vs 181 hrs) and reduced hospital LOS (51 days vs 82 days).\n",
      "This trial aimed to determine if the beneficial intervention of early RRT was sustained at the 1 year mark.\n",
      "It is known that the mortality and morbidity after receiving RRT in ICU is high. For example, the POST-RENAL (prolonged outcomes after kidney injury requiring dialysis in the ICU) study suggested that at 4 years more than 60% of patients who had received dialysis in ICU were now dead and more than 5% of those who survived required ongoing dialysis.\n",
      "The STAART-AKI trial is currently recruiting. This trial is larger than ELAIN as it is aiming to recruit 2866 patients (vs 231 for ELAIN). It is comparing early RRT vs standard care. This study includes ICU adults with renal dysfunction who have i) A doubling of baseline creatinine OR ii) Cr >354umol/L OR iii) UO<0.5ml/kg/hr for 12 hours. The primary outcome is 90 day mortality and independence from RRT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Design\n",
      "\n",
      "The ELAIN trial was randomised, unblinded, single-centre with complete follow-up. Patients were allocated 1:1 for early vs late dialysis stratified by hemodynamic SOFA score.\n",
      "For patients discharged alive at 90 days, telephone calls were made to the general practitioner, subject or family member to determine if the patient was alive, if they were requiring RRT or if they had persistent renal dysfunction (defined as 25% decline in eGFR compared with baseline calculated with the Cockroft-Gault formula)\n",
      "In addition the relation of inflammatory biomarkers (collected at ICU Day 0 and Day 3) to the MAKE365 outcome was analysed.\n",

      "The results suggest that early RRT, in predominantly post-operative patients with Stage 2 AKI, positively influences mortality and other patient centred outcomes at 1 year.\n",
      "Renal replacement therapy does carry cost and some risk to patients, so although this encourages me to use RRT early, I await the results of the STAART-AKI trial, which will be invaluable in answering the important question of the optimal timing of RRT in critically ill patients.\n",

      "\n",
      "Results from this single-centre study suggest that a strategy of no sedation is promising, but a multi centre trial is needed to show that the benefits of this strategy can be reproduced in other facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "Authors designed trial to question their own established practice.\n",
      "Control group were treated as per previously published protocol by Kress, allowing direct comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a baseline difference in patient gender, with a greater proportion of women being allocated to the control group. Although not reported, this difference is statistically significant (p=0.05 by Fisher’s exact test). Given the adequate concealment of allocation, this is likely to have occurred by an outside chance. In my opinion, it is unlikely that this gender difference will have affected the observed primary or secondary outcomes, but that cannot be said with certainty.\n",
      "Given the intervention of ‘no sedation’ was the institution’s normal practice, and the complete lack of any blinding, there is an inherent bias towards finding a larger difference in favour of the intervention (i.e. a more positive outcome). This also reduces the external validity, as there may be a learning curve associated with using ‘no sedation’.\n",
      "19% of the randomised patients were excluded from data analysis (modified intention-to-treat analysis) as they were extubated or dead within 48 hours. Whilst this is a common method (see Kress for example), I would like to see mortality and length of stay data including these patients. Unbiased and fair randomisation should minimise any bias from this modified analysis.\n",
      "10 (18%) patients in the ‘no sedation’ group deviated from protocol and received continuous sedation. This will reduce the observed difference, and highlights the difficulty with applying this ‘no sedation’ strategy despite their expertise and staffing.\n",
      "The outcome measures were reported as corrected for baseline characteristics using multiple linear regression statistics. Although the uncorrected findings were still statistically significant (p=0.035), it may have been better to report all raw data then a selection of corrected data.\n",
      "Non-standard definition of ventilator-associated pneumonia.\n",
      "Additional staffing was required to support 20% of the ‘no sedation’ patients, compared to 5% of the ‘sedation’ patients. This additional resource may outweigh any benefit from a reduced length of stay. The 24 hour availability of an ICM specialist doctor may also reduce the generalisability to units with less staffing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "This study should make clinicians question the dogma of sedation in ICUs, but clinical practice should not change immediately because of this study alone.\n",
      "A strategy of ‘no sedation’ may be feasible in ICUs, but may require additional staffing.\n",
      "Further multi-centre trials are required with patient-centred outcomes and cost-analyses.\n",

      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaning from MV accounts for up to 40% of time spent on MV and an SBT constitutes the gold standard diagnostic test to determine a patients’ readiness for extubation\n",

      "Decades of research have been dedicated to finding the optimal protocolized SBT modality that best simulates physiologic conditions post-extubation, in order to infer a patients’ readiness to liberate from MV\n",
      "Recent meta-analyses and guidance have been inconclusive or contradicting\n",
      "Studies have shown that different SBT modalities and duration demonstrate no significant difference regarding success rate of extubation (PSV vs. T-piece for 2h, 30-minute vs. 2h PSV or 30-minute vs. 2h T-piece).

Respiratory muscles can become fatigued and it is hypothesised that a SBT can lead to fatigue and increase the probability of failure.

      "In critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury, does accelerated initiation of renal replacement therapy compared to standard initiation improve 90 day survival?\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and some case series suggest up to 2/3rds of ICU patients develop some degree of renal impairment. Up to 50% of these patients may need dialysis which increases the complexity and cost of the care of the critically ill. Patients with critical illness and AKI have a high mortality.\n",
      "The purported rationale for early dialysis include: achieving optimal fluid balance via ultrafiltration, removal of toxic solutes that may mitigate the inflammatory milieu and correcting metabolic acidosis that may contribute to haemodynamic instability\n",
      "The purported rationale for delaying dialysis include: less procedural related risk to the patient, avoidance in some situations of an unnecessary intervention if the patient’s renal function improves spontaneously, resource rationing and avoidance of iatrogenic hypovolaemia from excessive ultrafiltration.\n",
      "Previously, there have been several trials conducted exploring the optimal timing of renal replacement therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AKIKI trial looked at a predominantly medical cohort of patients with AKI & consequent metabolic derangement, and randomised them to early or late dialysis. At Day 60, there was no difference in mortality. Patients in this trial could receive intermittent or continuous dialysis.\n",
      "The ELAIN trial looked at a predominantly surgical cohort of patients with AKI (KDIGO stage 3) and randomised to early or late dialysis. The hazard ratio of death at day 90 was 0.66 in favour of the early initiation strategy (95% CI 0.45 to 0.97; p-value = 0.03). However, the fragility of this trial was 3.\n",

      "Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and some case series suggest up to 2/3rds of ICU patients develop some degree of renal impairment. Up to 50% of these patients may need dialysis which increases the complexity and cost of the care of the critically ill. Patients with critical illness and AKI have a high mortality.\n",
      "The purported rationale for early dialysis include: achieving optimal fluid balance via ultrafiltration, removal of toxic solutes that may mitigate the inflammatory milieu and correcting metabolic acidosis that may contribute to haemodynamic instability\n",
      "The purported rationale for delaying dialysis include: less procedural related risk to the patient, avoidance in some situations of an unnecessary intervention if the patient’s renal function improves spontaneously, resource rationing and avoidance of iatrogenic hypovolaemia from excessive ultrafiltration.\n",
      "Previously, there have been several trials conducted exploring the optimal timing of renal replacement therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AKIKI trial looked at a predominantly medical cohort of patients with AKI & consequent metabolic derangement, and randomised them to early or late dialysis. At Day 60, there was no difference in mortality. Patients in this trial could receive intermittent or continuous dialysis.\n",
      "The ELAIN trial looked at a predominantly surgical cohort of patients with AKI (KDIGO stage 3) and randomised to early or late dialysis. The hazard ratio of death at day 90 was 0.66 in favour of the early initiation strategy (95% CI 0.45 to 0.97; p-value = 0.03). However, the fragility of this trial was 3.\n",
      "The IDEAL trial studied patients with septic shock and acute kidney injury. This randomised controlled trial that was stopped early due to futility, found no difference in mortality with the use of early vs. delayed renal replacement therapy\n",

      "In adult patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), does the addition of acetazolamide to loop diuretics improve decongestion by day 3?\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Fluid overload has been independently shown to increase mortality in the general ICU population\n",
      "A recent registry study of nearly 50,000 ICU admissions reported that around half of all ICU patients are administered diuretics during their stay – in 95% of instances patients receive furosemide\n",
      "The ASCEND-HF trial showed that a high proportion of patients with ADHF were admitted to a critical care area (ICU or CCU) and re-admission rates are high (50% within 6 months)\n",
      "Readmission is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, however optimal strategies for decongestion are yet to be determined\n",
      "\n",
      "What did they do?\n",
      "\n",
      "Between 2018 and 2022, 519 adult patients admitted to hospital with ADHF and clinical signs of fluid overload alongside a raised BNP were randomised\n",
      "Important exclusion criteria included current use of acetazolamide or an SGLT2 inhibitor, hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg), a GFR < 20 ml /min\n",
      "Treatment with IV furosemide > 80 mg (or equivalent) during index hospitalization was not allowed prior to randomisation\n",
      "Patients were randomised in 1:1 ratio to receive either 500mg dose of acetazolamide or matching placebo\n",
      "\n",
      "This was given for 3 days or until complete decongestion (clinical absence of fluid overload (oedema, pleural effusions and ascites)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Loop diuretics were given at double maintenance dose (as a bolus and then split into two doses per day for the next 2 days)\n",
      "\n",
      "Median daily maintenance dose of furosemide was 60mg across all groups\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment could be escalated according to a protocol if urine output insufficient and ongoing evidence of fluid overload\n",
      "Baseline characteristics were balanced between groups\n",
      "\n",
      "What did it show?\n",
      "\n",
      " Increased rates of successful decongestion in acetazolamide group (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.17 – 1.82)\n",
      "This seemed to persist to hospital discharge in an exploratory analysis\n",
      "Increased diuresis (500mls at 48 hours, 95% CI 200 to 800mls) and natriuresis on day 2 in acetazolamide group\n",
      "No difference in mortality or length of hospital stay\n",
      "No difference in adverse events\n",
      "\n",
      "How does it fit into other evidence?\n",
      "\n",
      "The DOSE trial was a 2×2 factorial trial that randomized patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) to a high or low dose furosemide strategy as either a bolus or continuous infusion\n",
      "No significant difference in patient’s perceived symptoms or renal function was noted between the groups, however across all groups only ~15% were free from congestion at 72 hours\n",
      "This study shows that decongestion can be improved with the addition of acetazolamide, however, benefit with respect to patient focused outcomes have yet to be shown\n",
      "Ultrafiltration as a strategy to decongest ADHF patients has also been studied (UNLOAD, CARESS-HF) with differing results with respect to success of decongestion and hospital readmissions\n",

      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance of nutritional support during critical illness in the ICU is well established. However, the various aspects of delivering this nutritional care is unclear because of diverging conclusions from recent trials. This may contribute to the variations seen in clinical practice and in national and international guidelines\n",
      "As an example, ESPEN (European) guidelines recommend early-initiation of parenteral nutrition (PN) whilst ASPEN (American and Canadian) guidelines recommend later initiation of PN in adults who are receiving insufficient enteral nutrition in the intensive care unit (ICU)\n",
      "Individualised goal-directed nutrition therapy with measured requirements has been proposed as one of several potentially beneficial strategies. EAT-ICU is the first randomised trial to assess the effect of individualised energy and protein supply to ICU patients, based on indirect calorimetry and 24-h urinary urea excretion (nitrogen balance) on physical quality of life\n",

      "The EGDN strategy resulted in greater energy and protein delivery in the ICU compared to standard care, but no differences were observed in PSC score at 6 months or any other clinically important outcomes\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "A highly relevant clinical question and hot research topic\n",
      "The primary outcome was a long term, physically focused outcome\n",
      "Study design attempts to address and provide titrated nutrition based on metabolic changes that occur during critical illness. This is only attempted in a few previous RCTs\n",
      "Provides further evidence about the utility of IC in critical illness\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a small, single centre study, and so the results may not be generalisable to all populations\n",
      "The primary outcome was a long term outcome, but the intervention was early and very short duration. It may not be biologically plausible that the intervention would effect the outcome\n",
      "Missing data was imputed. It seemed to be well understood and conducted by the authors but there is always a risk of inappropriate imputation\n",
      "The patients may not have been likely to benefit from intervention as they were not long stay patients (7 days)\n",
      "Early nutrition intervention when metabolic processes are aimed to mobilise endogenous energy stores may place the patient under further metabolic stress\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "In critically ill adults, EGDN provided early in ICU stay, and for a short duration, resulted in better nutritional outcomes but there was no difference in clinically important outcomes\n",
      "This study provides a base from which future research can be conducted into questions such as when nutrition should be commenced and how metabolic processes differ during critical illness\n",

      "The two biggest studies regarding the use of steroids for septic shock have found conflicting results. On the basis of these studies I will not use steroids as routine for patients with septic shock due to the potential side effects. However in patients that are not responding to treatment and are at high risk of death, I will continue to use steroids as some benefits have been reported. I will not base my decision on the corticotrophin result as other studies have reported a number of limitations with using this test in critically ill patients. I eagerly await the results of the ADRENAL study which will hopefully allow a more evidenced based decision to be made.\n",

      "\n",
      "In adult patients presenting to the emergency department with septic shock, does early low-dose norepinephrine compared with standard care increase shock control at six hours?\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "The optimal timing for introduction of vasopressor therapy in patients with septic shock is not known. Traditionally, patients with sepsis and hypotension are given fluids first and the introduction of vasopressors follows in an ad hoc fashion depending on response to the fluid therapy\n",
      "The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Bundle, updated in 2018, suggests rapid initial resuscitation with the aim to achieve the following in the first hour\n",
      "\n",
      "measure lactate (repeat if initial elevated >2mmol/L)\n",
      "obtain blood cultures before antibiotics\n",
      "administer broad-spectrum antibiotics\n",
      "begin rapid administration of 30ml/kg of crystalloid if hypotensive or lactate >4mmol/L\n",
      "Apply vasopressors if hypotensive during or after fluid resuscitation to maintain MAP >65mmHg\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, there are elements of this bundle that are controversial and based on weak levels of evidence\n",
      "There has not been any large prospective studies in humans to define the optimal timing of introduction of vasopressor support, ie before fluid resuscitation vs during fluid resuscitation vs following a trial of fluid resuscitation\n",
      "A pilot trial examining a regimen of restricted fluids and early vasopressor compared to usual care for initial resuscitation of hypotension due to suspected sepsis has been completed and published (REFRESH trial) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30382308\n",
      "\n",
      "Design\n",
      "\n",
      "Single centre, double-blind, RCT\n",
      "1:1 assignment to groups\n",
      "Allocation concealment achieved by a computer-generated randomisation table\n",
      "Blinding; the study drug, noradrenaline, and the placebo were packaged in identical containers\n",
      "The outcome assessors were unaware of the group allocation\n",
      "A sample size of 300 would provide 80% power to detect a predicted rate of shock resolution of 80% in the norepinephrine group vs 60% in the placebo group\n",
      "Analysis was by intention to treat\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting\n",
      "\n",
      "The trial was conducted at Siriraj Hospital, a large university-based, tertiary referral hospital in Thailand\n",
      "Recruitment occurred between October 2013 and March 2017\n",
      "\n",
      "Population\n",
      "\n",
      "Inclusion: patients >18 years, presenting to the emergency department with MAP <65mmHg with infection as the suspected cause\n",
      "Exclusion: septic shock >1 hour, acute CVA, ACS, APO, status asthmatics, active cardiac arrhythmia, acute GIH, pregnancy, burns, advanced cancer, refusing medical therapies\n",
      "456 patients with MAP<65mmHg were screened. 320 of these met the inclusion criteria. Seven patients in the intervention arm and 3 in the control arm withdrew consent to participate. This left 310 patients, allocated to 2 groups with 155 patients per group\n",
      "Baseline demographics were well matched, including age, source of sepsis, co-morbidities and APACHE II scores\n",
      "\n",
      "Intervention\n",
      "\n",
      "4mg of norepinephrine was added to 250ml of 5% Dextrose and administered through a peripheral line or central line at 0.05 ug/kg/min (for a 70kg person this equals 13ml/hr, or 3.5 mcg/min)\n",

      "\n",
      "Management common to both groups\n",
      "\n",
      "All other treatments were as per the SSC guideline of 2012, that is, crystalloid bolus, antibiotics, source control and organ support\n",
      "If MAP>65mmHg not achieved after 30ml/hr of crystalloid then open label vasopressors were permitted\n",
      "Patients were managed in the ICU OR the ward, with a central line OR peripheral line, with an arterial line OR with 15 minutely BP checks\n",
      "Patients were admitted to the ICU if they needed mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy or invasive haemodynamic monitoring\n",
      "\n",
      "Outcome\n",
      "\n",
      "Primary outcome: shock control by 6 hours. This was defined as sustained MAP>65mmHg (>15 minutes) AND 2 consecutive hours of urine output >0.5ml/kg/hr OR decrease in serum lactate >10% from the initial lactate level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early norepinephrine group vs the control group: 76.1% vs 48.4% achieved shock resolution at 6 hours (OR 3.4, 95% CI 2.09-5.53, p<0.001)\n",

      "\n",
      "Authors’ Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "Early norepinephrine was associated with increased shock control at 6 hours\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "This phase II clinical trial proposes an important clinical question that will add to the literature regarding optimal timing of vasopressor use in septic shock\n",
      "It is the first prospective trial examining this specific component of the surviving sepsis bundle.\n",
      "Allocation concealment, blinding, intention to treat analysis, complete follow-up achieved\n",
      "Lactate clearance has previously been found to be a useful surrogate for mortality prediction in patients with septic shock\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "Single centre trial in a developing nation with limited ICU resources – reduces the external validity of the trial\n",
      "Clinicians may be able to guess the allocation of the patient group as they may see an increment in the blood pressure, thus unblinding the trial. The authors point out that around 20% of the control group also had an increment in blood pressure\n",
      "The primary outcome was not clinically meaningful.  Secondary outcomes were clinically meaningful but the trial was not powered to detect differences in these and thus these are hypothesis generating outcomes which may guide design of future trials in this area\n",
      "Of interest, patients received similar median volumes of resuscitative fluids. Early use of vasopressors in septic shock has been promoted as a way to reduce fluid volumes administered but this was not seen here\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the results seem encouraging and would certainly provide a basis to conduct a larger, multi-centre trial to explore the important question of timing of initiation of vasopressor therapies in septic shock\n",
      "Low-dose, dilute norepinephrine was given safely through a peripheral line in more than half the patients,  without adverse effect. This is reassuring that this practice is safe in time-poor or resource-poor environments\n",
      "This is a well-conducted trial that really adds to the literature base for management of septic shock\n",

      "Only 43% in the shock group received at least 1 dose of hydrocortisone\n",

      "In patients with severe sepsis what is the sensitivity of blood cultures taken after the initiation of antimicrobial therapy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Early empiric antibiotic therapy is one of the key management goals in septic shock. Delay in first antibiotic dose is associated with a linear increase in the risk of mortality for each hour delay in antibiotic administration\n",
      "Inappropriate antibiotic choice is also associated with an increase in mortality. The mortality increases from 18 to 34% in those who have had inappropriate antibiotic selection\n",
      "Knowing the microbiological diagnoses helps clinicians tailor antimicrobial therapy\n",
      "The surviving sepsis campaign recommends taking blood cultures before starting antimicrobial therapies. However, there is a concern that waiting for blood culture collection may delay antimicrobial therapy\n",

      "If the patient had the first blood culture positive and received an antibiotic that the organism was NOT susceptible to, then the postantimicrobial culture was positive in 66.7% of cases\n",
      "If blood cultures were positive pre- and post- therapy the cultures became positive a median of 4 hours sooner after collection in the pre-therapy group\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Authors’ Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "Drawing blood cultures after antimicrobial therapy in patients with severe sepsis significantly reduces the sensitivity of the blood culture\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "The trial used best practice when collecting blood culture samples pre-antimicrobial therapy, ie 2 separate sets, from 2 separate venepuncture sites. This reduced the chance of non-pathogenic contaminants\n",
      "The trial results adds weight to the recommendation that all efforts should be made to sample pre-therapy\n",
      "The contamination rate overall was 4.9% which is acceptable\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "The trial does not have a comparator control group, so time to antibiotic therapy is not measured and even if it was, there is no control group to determine whether taking blood cultures pre-antibiotics means there’s a delay in giving antibiotic therapy\n",
      "Only a proportion of patients screened were recruited. This limits the generalisability of these results as those that weren’t included may have had some fundamental differences from the study group\n",
      "Some variability between sites as to the method of taking the repeat blood cultures\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "Positive blood cultures are far more likely to occur if cultures are drawn prior to antibiotic therapy. Logically, this is likely to help tailor antimicrobial therapy and allow de-escalation of treatment when results are obtained\n",
      "I will endeavour to take blood cultures in my patients in a timely fashion before antibiotics, providing there is no delay in giving antimicrobials\n",

I will continue to reach for noradrenaline for patients with septic shock. The study does provide some reassurance that adrenaline infusion is a reasonable alternative in the early phase of shock or in resource limited settings.\n",

      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and some case series suggest up to 2/3rds of ICU patients develop some degree of renal impairment. Up to 50% of these patients may need dialysis which increases the complexity and cost of the care of the critically ill. Patients with critical illness and AKI have a high mortality.\n",
      "The purported rationale for early dialysis include: achieving optimal fluid balance via ultrafiltration, removal of toxic solutes that may mitigate the inflammatory milieu and correcting metabolic acidosis that may contribute to haemodynamic instability\n",
      "The purported rationale for delaying dialysis include: less procedural related risk to the patient, avoidance in some situations of an unnecessary intervention if the patient’s renal function improves spontaneously, resource rationing and avoidance of iatrogenic hypovolaemia from excessive ultrafiltration.\n",
      "Previously, there have been several trials conducted exploring the optimal timing of renal replacement therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AKIKI trial looked at a predominantly medical cohort of patients with AKI & consequent metabolic derangement, and randomised them to early or late dialysis. At Day 60, there was no difference in mortality. Patients in this trial could receive intermittent or continuous dialysis.\n",
      "The ELAIN trial looked at a predominantly surgical cohort of patients with AKI (KDIGO stage 3) and randomised to early or late dialysis. The hazard ratio of death at day 90 was 0.66 in favour of the early initiation strategy (95% CI 0.45 to 0.97; p-value = 0.03). However, the fragility of this trial was 3.\n",

      "\n",
      "In critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury, an early compared with a delayed initiation of renal replacement therapy showed no difference in mortality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "Randomised controlled trial\n",
      "Multi-centre\n",
      "Adequately powered\n",
      "Defined criteria for initiation of RRT\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "For over 50% of patients the initial modality of RRT was intermittent RRT. This was despite the fact that 85% of patients required vasopressor support upon initiation of RRT. This may limit the external validity as this is not standard practice in the UK.\n",
      "A limitation that the authors state is that the study only included patients with advanced kidney injury, and therefore the results may not be generalisable to patients with less severe kidney injuries.\n",
      "Non-blinded – although unavoidable the unblinded clinician also directed care which may introduce bias.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "In critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury, an early approach to RRT did not provide a mortality benefit compared to a delayed approach; when the RRT modality was predominately intermittent RRT.\n",
      "~50% of the patients in the delayed group did not receive RRT\n",
      "There was a significantly higher rate of catheter related nosocmial infections in the early group\n",

      "Clinical Question\n",
      "\n",
      "In critically ill adults does the use of a balanced multielectrolyte solution (BMES, Plasmalyte 148), as opposed to 0.9% Sodium Chloride, for fluid resuscitation and therapy result in reduced 90 day mortality?\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Fluid administration is a key component of critical care therapy\n",
      "If one fluid is superior to another, even by the smallest margin, the global impact on critical care outcomes will be significant\n",
      "Saline has long been the most commonly administered fluid in the ICU, but there have been concerns that a hyperchloraemic acidosis may induce renal impairment, although recent trials have had conflicting outcomes\n",
      "\n",
      "The most recently published BaSICS trial showed no difference in 90-day mortality between Plasmalyte and 0.9% Sodium Chloride in 11000 adult intensive care patients\n",
      "The SMART trial involving 15000 adult ICU patients in 2018 showed a reduction in a composite outcome of death, new renal replacement therapy and persistent renal dysfunction at 30 days, with balanced crystalloid use\n",
      "The SPLIT trial in 2015 compared Plasmalyte to 0.9% Sodium Chloride in 2278 critically ill patients. There was no difference in the primary outcome of proportion of patients with an acute kidney injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although not statistically significant, point estimates favoured Plasmalyte with regards to the secondary outcomes of RRT requirement and death in hospital\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Saline is the most commonly administered crystalloid but it’s safety has been questioned in retrospective observational studies and experimental models as the high chloride load may decrease renal cortical blood flow, increase risk of death and increase the need for renal replacement therapy\n",

There was no difference in the primary outcome of acute kidney injury or requirement for renal replacement therapy and no difference in hospital mortality (plasmalyte-148 versus saline, 7.5% vs 8.6%, RR 0.87 95%CI 0.66-1.55, p=0.36). However, the repeated signals favouring balanced crystalloids have prompted investigators to conduct trials with adequate power.

      "Authors’ Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "The trial involving critically ill adults, favours administering intravenous balanced crystalloids over saline to decrease a composite outcome of death, new renal replacement therapy or persistent renal dysfunction at 30 days\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "An important clinical question with sound pathophysiological and experimental basis\n",
      "Large sample size provides power to detect small differences in clinical outcomes\n",
      "The use of the composite outcome means that if clinically significant components are rare it is easier to detect an overall treatment effect\n",
      "Pragmatic design, randomised, complete follow-up, intention to treat analysis\n",
      "A mixed cohort of medical and surgical patients making the result suitable for extrapolation to any critically ill patient\n",
      "Separation between groups of fluids received indicating that the allocation was largely successful\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients remaining in the ICU at the end of a calendar month may have been exposed to both types of crystalloids. The between group difference in outcome may therefore be reduced.\n",
      "A composite outcome may exaggerate a result as endpoints of differing importance are unreasonably combined making the treatment effect appear more impressive than it is\n",
      "The composite outcome ‘MAKE 30’ consisted of mortality, new renal-replacement therapy or persistent renal dysfunction (creatinine 2x baseline). Other trials, eg ELAIN follow-up study, define persistent renal dysfunction as a decline in eGFR by 25% compared with baseline. Care needs to be taken by the reader to understand the actual definition of the major adverse kidney event is in each trial using this outcome\n",
      "Single centre trial may limit the external validity of the results\n",
      "The treating clinicians were not blinded. This may introduce an element of conscious or unconscious bias.\n",
      "The trial does not tell us if Plasmalyte-A or Lactated Ringer’s is better, only that they are likely to be superior to saline in this study\n",
      "The predicted incidence of the outcome was 15%. The result may be more obvious if a sicker cohort of patients was studied. The subgroup of those with sepsis demonstrated a mortality of 25.2% in the balanced crystalloid group and 29.4% in the saline group (adjusted OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.67-0.97, p=0.02). This subgroup analysis is hypothesis generating only\n",
      "The treating physician could exclude a patient if they felt administration of a balanced crystalloid solution could make their patient’s hyperkalemia worse. This allayed the incorrect perception by some physicians that saline is better in patients with hyperkalemia. In fact, the hyperchloremic acidosis produced by normal saline may exacerbate a hyperkalemic state due to shift of H+ intracellularly in exchange for K+. 348 patients had their allocation of balanced crystalloid over-ruled by the treating physician due to the presence of hyperkalemia, meaning 93.4% compliance with allocation to balance crystalloid. This deviation from group allocation could diminish the observed difference in the primary outcome.\n",
      "The treating physician could exclude a patient with a primary brain injury from receiving balanced crystalloid. 278 patients received saline in this group when allocated to a balanced crystalloid\n",
      "The patients received relatively small volumes of fluid: median 1000ml for balanced-crystalloid group and 1020ml for the saline group. The difference in the primary outcome was greater in a pre-specified subgroup who received larger volumes of crystalloid\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "This large and strong methodological study adds further doubt to the safety of normal saline use in critically ill patients. My choice in sick patients is to use balanced solutions\n",
      "The composite endpoint is difficult to interpret and may exaggerate the benefit of balanced solutions\n",
      "The PLUS trial results are keenly awaited as this has a solid clinically meaningful outcome (90 day mortality) and the cohort of patients has a higher baseline mortality so the effect may be more obvious\n",

      "\n",
      "Treatment with a 7-day fixed-dose course of hydrocortisone or shock-dependent dosing of hydrocortisone (compared with no hydrocortisone) resulted in 93% and 80% probabilities of superiority with regard to the odds of improvement in organ support–free days within 21 days\n",
      "It is re-iterated that neither hydrocortisone groups met the pre-specified criteria for statistical superiority and thus definitive conclusions cannot be drawn\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "Multi-centre international, randomised trial with a pragmatic design\n",
      "The presentation of Bayesian results gives a “real-life” probability by which the treatment being tested may be beneficial:\n",
      "\n",
      "This appears easier to interpret for both clinicians and when discussing treatments with non clinicians\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of all patients, and not just those in the corticosteroid domain, enables the maximal amount of information available to be studied.\n",
      "\n",
      "This increases the accuracy of the adjustments made in the primary model (e.g. those for age, sex, time)\n",
      "The use of two analyses serves to confirm the stability of the results\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The prior based on information from ICNARC\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "15% (n = 15) of the no hydrocortisone group did receive a systemic corticosteroid, of which the median duration was 2 days\n",
      "\n",
      "All groups were allowed to receive systemic corticosteroid therapy if a new clinical indication allowed (e.g. post extubation stridor)\n",
      "It could be debated as to whether this would affect outcomes – if steroids are favourable, then the administration to the no hydrocortisone group would only likely serve to reduce the probability by which corticosteroid administration is deemed to be beneficial\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Only 43% in the shock group received at least 1 dose of hydrocortisone\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors state that if corticosteroids are beneficial in COVID-19 (in ways other then mitigating shock) then this group maybe under-treated\n",
      "\n",
      "This may result in the 80% probability being underestimated\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With regards to patient selection:\n",
      "\n",
      "of the 1165 patients assessed, 42 of these were excluded as the clinician intended to administer corticosteroids, and of the 614 who met the severe COVID-19 definition, 38 were excluded as the clinician intended to administer corticosteroids\n",
      "\n",
      "This may result in some selection bias as this is ~7% of all patients assessed\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Groups not completely balanced at baseline – lower use of mechanical ventilation and vasopressors in the arm that received no corticosteroids\n",
      "Trial not blinded\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors make a very rational argument that blinding would have impacted significantly on the speed in which this trial was set up and able to enrol patients (which is important in a pandemic)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6% of patients withdrew consent or did not have outcome data available. There is concern of this introducing bias, particularly in an open label trial\n",
      "No low income countries randomised, and a large proportion (n = 419 in all domains) were randomised from the UK\n",
      "The cessation of the trial earlier than planned meant that the pre-defined statistical triggers were not reached and thus definitive statistical conclusions can not be drawn\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the trial was open label this was important to minimise (although highly unlikely) any protocol violations given the strongly positive effects shown in RECOVERY\n",
      "The authors acknowledge that no optimal strategy of corticosteroid use is shown by this study\n",
      "Prescott and Rice in their JAMA editorial highlight many further clinical questions that still need to be answered\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that such a large, international trial has been so rapidly and rigorously conducted alongside a significant burden of clinical critical care work is remarkably impressive\n",
      "Although no statistical triggers were reached, the Bayesian approach gives a high probability of superiority of corticosteroid use (compared to no corticosteroid use) in organ support free days within 21 days. It also reported a large reduction in the progression to invasive ventilation, ECMO or death with the use of steroids\n",
      "Medicine is a balance of benefit and risk. With the high probability of benefit and low evidence of harm from this study, combined with the evidence from the RECOVERY trial and the WHO meta-analysis, I will continue to advocate for the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19\n",

      "In a non-COVID ARDS trial (DEXA-ARDS) the use of higher dose dexamethasone (20mg from day 1-5, then 10mg from day 6-10) compared with standard treatment resulted in significantly fewer ventilator days\n",

      "\n",
      "Treatment with dexamethasone 12mg vs 6mg did not significantly improve days alive without life support at 28 days , however the lower limit of the 95% CI was 0.0 suggesting that the results are most compatible with a benefit from 12mg\n",

      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "29 fewer patients included in primary analysis than planned according to power calculation\n",
      "It may have been preferable to have 28 day mortality as primary outcome\n",
      "We are told the number of patients who received IL-6 inhibitors at randomisation but not the total number that received them during the intervention period\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "In patients with severe COVID-19 who were predominately not treated with tociluzimab, the use of 12mg compared with 6mg dexamethasone resulted in no significant difference in the number of days alive without life support at day 28, or 28 day mortality\n",
      "The confidence intervals suggest the potential that there may be a benefit with higher dose dexamethasone but the trial was under-powered to determine this. If there is a difference between treatment groups, it is much less likely that 6mg would give a benefit compared with 12mg. As there was no significant difference in side effects between treatment groups it could be argued that we should change to 12mg dosing for dexamethasone\n",
      "However there were low numbers of patients treated with tociluzimab in this trial. Following the Recovery and REMAP-CAP trial results tociluzimab has become standard care. We do not know the impact that the standard use of tociluzimab would have had on these results\n",
      "I will consider using a higher dose of dexamethasone in patients with severe COVID-19 that are unable to receive tociluzimab. In patients that have received tociluzimab, I will continue to use 6mg of dexamethasone, but in selected cases I would consider escalating this dose\n",
      "An upcoming Bayesian analysis of the data from the study group will hopefully aid the decision making\n",

      "\n",
      "Among infants with bronchiolitis who were treated outside of an ICU, those who received high-flow oxygen therapy had significantly lower rates of escalation of care due to treatment failure than those in the group that received standard therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "This study attempted to answer an important clinical question to a common paediatric problem.\n",
      "This was a large, multicentre RCT that was adequately powered to detect an absolute reduction in treatment failure of 5%\n",
      "The blocked randomization process meant that the intervention and control arms were well-balanced at baseline\n",
      "Treatment failure was based on objective measurements of clinical deterioration in over 60% of patients\n",
      "The secondary endpoints included patient-centred outcomes, such as ICU admission and hospital length of stay\n",
      "The study incorporated a pragmatic study design that reflected current clinical practice\n",
      "Investigators were blinded to the trial outcome until the final data analysis was complete\n",
      "Prespecified subgroup analysis was performed for premature infants, those with previous hospital admissions and with congenital heart disease. In addition, hospitals with and without an ICU were analysed separately\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "This was an unblinded study as the intervention could not be masked\n",
      "The primary outcome was a composite outcome that may be of limited clinical relevance\n",
      "There was a risk of selection bias, with 533 of 2217 potential participants missing the  opportunity for enrolment\n",
      "It was unclear what happened to the HFNP therapy group after treatment failure and ICU admission\n",
      "Clinicians could escalate if they were clinically concerned, even if patients did not meet the four predefined clinical criteria. This occurred in 34% of cases; 52 (31%) in standard oxygen group vs 34 (39%) in high flow therapy group. As a result, detection bias cannot be excluded\n",
      "High flow therapy is standard practice in Australia/NZ for more severe bronchiolitis – preconception can effect decision making a demonstrated by all patients in the standard therapy group who experienced treatment failure being escalated to high flow oxygen therapy\n",
      "There was a higher respiratory rate in the high flow oxygen therapy group at the time of escalation. This may have indicated a lower threshold for physicians to declare treatment failure in the standard oxygen arm\n",
      "There was a difference between regional/metropolitan and tertiary centres regarding the percentage of infants requiring escalation of therapy. In addition, there was a difference in escalation rates between hospitals that had an ICU versus hospitals with no ICU. This again raises the suspicion of differing thresholds for management escalation between clinicians and institutions\n",
      "There was no control on the other therapies employed that may affect escalation of therapy. For example, sedation was used in 35 (standard oxygen therapy) and 49 (high flow therapy). In addition, feeding was not protocolised or described in the standard oxygen therapy group\n",
      "There was possibly an underestimation of adverse events, As part of the study participating centres received large amounts of education and supervision regarding high flow therapy. This may have resulted in an underestimate of adverse events and may limit the external validity of the study\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "This study shows that the majority (77%) of children with hypoxia and bronchiolitis treated with standard oxygen therapy will not require any escalation of therapy. In those that do require escalation, more than half of these patients will only require escalation to high flow therapy\n",
      "Rescue high flow therapy, following clinical deterioration with standard therapy, is beneficial\n",
      "In this study High flow therapy did not have more adverse events and therefore may be suitable for ward use with appropriate education and support\n",
      "My current practice is to use high flow therapy only as rescue therapy in the hypoxic infant with bronchiolitis and I will not change my practice based on this study\n",

      "It is re-iterated that neither hydrocortisone groups met the pre-specified criteria for statistical superiority and thus definitive conclusions cannot be drawn\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "Multi-centre international, randomised trial with a pragmatic design\n",
      "The presentation of Bayesian results gives a “real-life” probability by which the treatment being tested may be beneficial:\n",
      "\n",
      "This appears easier to interpret for both clinicians and when discussing treatments with non clinicians\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of all patients, and not just those in the corticosteroid domain, enables the maximal amount of information available to be studied.\n",
      "\n",
      "This increases the accuracy of the adjustments made in the primary model (e.g. those for age, sex, time)\n",
      "The use of two analyses serves to confirm the stability of the results\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The prior based on information from ICNARC\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "15% (n = 15) of the no hydrocortisone group did receive a systemic corticosteroid, of which the median duration was 2 days\n",
      "\n",
      "All groups were allowed to receive systemic corticosteroid therapy if a new clinical indication allowed (e.g. post extubation stridor)\n",
      "It could be debated as to whether this would affect outcomes – if steroids are favourable, then the administration to the no hydrocortisone group would only likely serve to reduce the probability by which corticosteroid administration is deemed to be beneficial\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Only 43% in the shock group received at least 1 dose of hydrocortisone\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors state that if corticosteroids are beneficial in COVID-19 (in ways other then mitigating shock) then this group maybe under-treated\n",
      "\n",
      "This may result in the 80% probability being underestimated\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With regards to patient selection:\n",
      "\n",
      "of the 1165 patients assessed, 42 of these were excluded as the clinician intended to administer corticosteroids, and of the 614 who met the severe COVID-19 definition, 38 were excluded as the clinician intended to administer corticosteroids\n",
      "\n",
      "This may result in some selection bias as this is ~7% of all patients assessed\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Groups not completely balanced at baseline – lower use of mechanical ventilation and vasopressors in the arm that received no corticosteroids\n",
      "Trial not blinded\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors make a very rational argument that blinding would have impacted significantly on the speed in which this trial was set up and able to enrol patients (which is important in a pandemic)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6% of patients withdrew consent or did not have outcome data available. There is concern of this introducing bias, particularly in an open label trial\n",
      "No low income countries randomised, and a large proportion (n = 419 in all domains) were randomised from the UK\n",
      "The cessation of the trial earlier than planned meant that the pre-defined statistical triggers were not reached and thus definitive statistical conclusions can not be drawn\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the trial was open label this was important to minimise (although highly unlikely) any protocol violations given the strongly positive effects shown in RECOVERY\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that such a large, international trial has been so rapidly and rigorously conducted alongside a significant burden of clinical critical care work is remarkably impressive\n",
      "Although no statistical triggers were reached, the Bayesian approach gives a high probability of superiority of corticosteroid use (compared to no corticosteroid use) in organ support free days within 21 days. It also reported a large reduction in the progression to invasive ventilation, ECMO or death with the use of steroids\n",
      "Medicine is a balance of benefit and risk. With the high probability of benefit and low evidence of harm from this study, combined with the evidence from the RECOVERY trial and the WHO meta-analysis, I will continue to advocate for the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19\n",

      "Clinical Question\n",
      "\n",
      "Does treatment with vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine lead to a more rapid resolution of septic shock compared with hydrocortisone alone?\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection\n",
      "A study published in the Lancet shows that in 2017, an estimated 48·9 million incident cases of sepsis were recorded worldwide and 11·0 million sepsis-related deaths were reported, representing 19·7% of all global deaths\n",
      "High-dose intravenous (IV) vitamin C has recently been explored as an adjunctive therapy in sepsis because of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. An RCT (Fowler, 2014) of 24 patients showed that high-dose IV vitamin C attenuated organ failure associated with sepsis in a dose-dependent manner. Thiamine deficiency has also been reported in 20% of critically ill patients with sepsis (Donnino 2010), and thiamine supplementation has been shown to improve lactate clearance in patients with sepsis (Woolum 2018)\n",
      "The combination of high-dose IV vitamin C and hydrocortisone together with thiamine was assessed in a single-center retrospective before-and-after study of 94 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (Marik 2017). The intervention was associated with shorter duration of vasopressor administration and lower hospital mortality\n",
      "\n",
      "Design\n",
      "\n",
      "Pilot, feasibility, multi-centre, randomised, open-label, phase IIb clinical trial\n",
      "Random allocation sequence was generated at the coordinating center using computer-generated random numbers with permuted block sizes of 2, 4, and 6 in a 1:1 ratio stratified by site\n",
      "Sample size was initially calculated from a retrospective before and after study with 126 patients required based on an SD of 42 vasopressor-free hours up to day 7. This was then updated from the pooled SD for the first 60 patients enrolled in the study, and the required sample size was recalculated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on an updated SD of 51.6 hours, the study was estimated to require 180 patients to have 90% power (2-sided α = .05) to detect a difference in vasopressor-free hours of 25\n",
      "As the distribution of the primary outcome was expected to be nonparametric, and nonparametric tests have been shown to have decreased statistical power compared with parametric tests, the sample size was inflated by 15% (189 patients). Finally, to account for consent withdrawal (5%), a total of 216 patients were planned to be enrolled.\n",

      "786 patients were screened; 216 were randomised; 5 patients (2 in the intervention group and 3 in the control group) either withdrew or refused consent to continue participation and withdrew all data, leaving 211 patients\n",
      "At baseline, patients in the intervention group had lower APACHE III scores, had higher lactate and white blood cell counts, and were more likely to have received milrinone. The primary sites of infection were predominantly pulmonary and gastrointestinal in the two groups\n",

      "\n",
      "Time alive and free of vasopressors meant the patient was alive at discontinuation of all intravenous vasopressors for at least 4 hours in the presence of a MAP>65 mmHg or target MAP set by treating physicians. If a patient died while receiving vasopressor therapy following the index episode of septic shock, the patient was assigned zero hours for this outcome. If a patient was weaned from all vasopressors for 4 consecutive hours, then all of the remaining time through day 7 was treated as success, even if the patient died or had vasopressors restarted after weaning within the 7-day period\n",
      "Use of vasopressors defined as any use of norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, (*metaraminol, dopamine, or phenylephrine). Total vasopressor doses was calculated as the sum of norepinephrine doses and epinephrine and vasopressin doses were converted to equivalent norepinephrine doses. *Patients receiving metaraminol monotherapy did not contribute to total vasopressor dose data, and no patients received dopamine or phenylephrine\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondary outcomes: Of 10 pre-specified secondary outcomes, only one (change in SOFA score at day 3) showed a statistically significant difference\n",
      "Adverse Events: reported for 2 patients (2 events, fluid overload and hyperglycemia) in the intervention group and 1 patient (1 event, gastrointestinal bleeding) in the control group. No serious adverse events or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions were reported\n",

      "\n",
      "Authors’ Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "In patients with septic shock, treatment with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine, compared with intravenous hydrocortisone alone, did not significantly improve the duration of time alive and free of vasopressor administration over 7 days.

      "Weaknesses\n",

      "Target MAP set for each patient by treating clinicians was not collected\n",
      "Trial was underpowered to detect differences in mortality or other patient-centered outcomes\n",
      "Adverse events were reported only when treating clinicians adjudicated, and patients were not systematically examined for other possible adverse effects (eg, oxaluria) that might develop with high-dose IV vitamin C\n",
      "There is no data relating to fluid balance or cardiac output monitoring which may have influenced vasopressor requirement\n",
      "Time to the administration of antibiotics was not collected\n",
      "The median time from ICU admission to randomisation was 12 hours. Even if delays presenting to Emergency Department and transferring to ICU are not taken into account, this delay may have reduced drug efficacy\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "I will continue my current practice which is not to use the HAT (hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid and thiamine) protocol for treating septic shock\n",
      "Further studies looking at timing of treatment intervention may be helpful although the unintended consequences of diverting funding from other research opportunities in sepsis and other diseases must also be considered. Completion of several existing trials will hopefully provide the information we need\n",
      "Whilst we continue our search for the elusive magic bullet for sepsis we must not lose focus on interventions that we know are life saving: the right antibiotics given early, together with antimicrobial stewardship, source control, and optimal  physiological support\n",

      "The early use of intravenous vitamin C, together with corticosteroids and thiamine may prove to be effective in preventing progressive organ dysfunction including acute kidney injury and reducing the mortality of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Additional studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "An interesting hypothesis generating study which has some biologically plausible explanations for benefit in sepsis\n",

      "\n",
      "This study is hypothesis generating. An RCT is required to determine the efficacy of vitamin C, steroids and thiamine in severe sepsis and septic shock. The results of ADRENAL will help guide future use of corticosteroids. I will not consider using vitamin C or thiamine in sepsis until additional studies, demonstrating benefit, are completed. Until then, I will eagerly wait to see if the combination of vitamin C, steroids and thiamine offers a ‘Marikle’ cure for sepsis\n",

      "\n",
      "Several eligible patients (a proportion of 324) were not enrolled due to physician refusal.\n",
      "The performance of the study was necessarily unblinded and level of sedation and timing of extubation was at the clinicians discretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Complicated statistical analysis including bootstrapping was employed due to the unusual distribution of the variable. These make interpretation of the study’s findings more difficult.\n",
      "The mechanism of the observed survival benefit is difficult to explain.\n",

      "Generalisability:\n",

      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of SATs during this trial appears to expedite weaning from mechanical ventilation, but the study findings may potentially reflect greater levels of oversedation in the control group or a bias towards early extubation in the intervention group.

      "\n",
      "Current resuscitation guidelines advocate a temperature between 32 and 36 degrees\n",
      "This can lead to shivering which can increase metabolic demand and counteract the beneficial effects of TTM\n",

      "\n",
      "The use of a continuous neuromuscular blockade in patients undergoing TTM following an OOHA when compared to on demand bolus neuromuscular blockade reduced shivering, time until awakening and length of intensive care stay without significant harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "Pragmatic design to answer a clinical question with limited evidence base\n",
      "\n",
      "Theory concerning risks of shivering such as increased metabolic demand must be balanced against potential for occurrence of critical illness myopathy with use of NMB\n",
      "Appropriate RCT methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good randomisation and concealment strategy, which reduces change of systematic bias\n",
      "Blinding of bedside clinicians reduces the chance of performance bias\n",
      "\n",
      "See note below regarding possible unintentional unblinding\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Balanced baseline characteristics results improves internal validity\n",
      "Recruited more patients than calculated sample size to allow for potential missing data such as early mortality.\n",
      "Attempted to collect patient-centred data for secondary and tertiary outcomes\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "Single centre with a small cohort of patients\n",
      "Basis for expected difference in power calculation not explained\n",
      "Not analysed on an intention to treat basis\n",
      "\n",
      "Two patients excluded following randomization\n",
      "However fragility index of 16 suggests the loss of these two patients does not weaken the conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary outcome, shivering assessment, was subjective and there is the risk of inter-observer variation\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of this is reduced by adequate blinding of observers\n",
      "The Shivering Assessment Scale has been validated and demonstrated excellent interrater reliability\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary outcome measure – occurrence of shivering – was also the trigger for administering NMB drugs in the control group\n",
      "\n",
      "It is therefore of no surprise that, if we wait for the primary outcome to occur before instigating a treatment, this treatment is associated with the primary outcome occurring more frequently!\n",
      "The primary outcome is of limited clinical relevance and of no relevance to the patient\n",
      "Important outcomes were only planned as secondary outcomes and therefore not powered for any conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Midazolam based sedation regimes are not used in some centres due to concerns around delayed waking; this will affect the external validity of the trial.\n",
      "Although initially double blinded (medications drawn up by nurse not involved in patients care) the clinical effects of saline or rocuronium may become apparent following administration resulting in an unintentional unblinding\n",
      "Significant numbers of patients were lost to final follow up – only 14% (9/63) had a neurological examination at one year\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore the incidence of polyneuropathy can not be assessed and no conclusions can be drawn surrounding the safety of continuous NMB infusion\n",
      "Given this and small sample sizes further work surrounding this should be carried to assess risk-benefit profile of continuous NMB.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no assessment for awareness with those having a continuous NMB infusion\n",
      "Depending on results of TTM2 this question may not be as relevant in the future\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "When cooling patients after cardiac arrest, if you wait until a patient shivers before administering a neuromuscular blocking drug rather than commencing an infusion from the time of admission, then they will shiver more\n",
      "This trial may indirectly show that by stopping people from shivering, then less sedation is required leading to earlier awakening and potential earlier ICU discharge, however these secondary outcomes should be considered hypothesis generating and further research is required\n",

      "Writing Group for the Alveolar Recruitment for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Trial (ART) Investigators. JAMA. 2017;318(14):1335-1345. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.14171\n",
      "Clinical Question\n",
      "\n",
      "In patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) does use of a lung recruitment maneuver associated with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration according to the best respiratory-system compliance, compared with a conventional low-PEEP strategy, decrease 28-day mortality?\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "ARDS affects 10-15% of the ICU patient population. ARDS is associated with increased mortality and poor long term quality of life. Mechanical ventilation is a key element of the management of ARDS, yet can also worsen the condition through ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and some ARDS patients still progress to ventilator-refractory hypoxaemia.\n",
      "An ‘open lung approach’ involving relatively high positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) settings and lung recruitment manoeuvres has been proposed as a means of reducing VILI (e.g. by decreasing atelectrauma) and improving oxygenation.\n",
      "Recruitment manoeuvres are designed to recruit more alveoli for gas exchange and increase the ventilated lung volume, using brief incremental increases in PEEP. In this study this was followed by down titration of PEEP to the PEEP that achieves the highest level of respiratory-system compliance (ratio of tidal volume to driving pressure), which was then set (+2 cmH2O) as the optimal PEEP\n",
      "Previous trials have found improvements in oxygenation, respiratory-system compliance, and biomarkers of systemic inflammation, without increasing barotrauma or other adverse events. However, proof of benefit in terms of patient-orientated outcomes is lacking, despite systematic reviews of pre-existing literature suggesting improved mortality with recruitment manoeuvres and no increase in barotrauma. In general, previous studies have been flawed due to study designs with a high risk of bias and highly variable use of co-interventions in addition to high PEEP and recruitment manoeuvres.\n",

      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite decades of research, the clinical benefits of higher PEEP and the best method to titrate PEEP for patients with ARDS remain unclear https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.201610-2035CI\n",
      "Plateau pressure (Pplt) measured during an inspiratory hold is typically used to approximate alveolar distending pressure\n",
      "The true distending pressure of a collapsible structure (like an alveolus) is defined by its transmural pressure (pressure inside minus pressure outside). For the lung, this pressure is termed the transpulmonary pressure (PL) and is defined by airway pressure minus pleural pressure\n",
      "For many mechanically ventilated patients, the contribution of pleural pressure to PL is minimal and Pplt serves as a reasonable approximation of alveolar stress. However, in patients with chest wall deformities, obesity, significant ascites, etc., Pplt may be an unreliable surrogate for PL\n",
      "Esophageal manometry using an esophageal balloon provides an approximation of pleural pressure through the measurement of esophageal pressure (PES) and may provide a mechanism to tailor PEEP to a patient’s lung mechanics\n",
      "This approach was studied in a previous single-center trial (the EPVent study) which was stopped early due to a significantly higher PaO2/FiO2 in the intervention arm (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0708638). However, the use of a low PEEP strategy in the control group may have biased the trial towards a positive result\n",

      "\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "Addresses a clinically relevant question\n",
      "The largest trial to date on the subject\n",
      "Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two study arms\n",
      "High adherence to trial protocol\n",
      "High concordance between interpretation of PES measurements at clinical sites and the core lab (only 1.8% of readings differed by more than 3 cmH2O)\n",
      "Few patients lost to follow-up\n",
      "The primary endpoint, while a composite outcome, placed more weight on death than ventilator free days avoiding the issue with many composite outcomes where two outcomes of significantly different clinical importance are weighted equally\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "The empiric PEEP – FiO2 table used was aggressive (at FiO2 0.6, the minimum allowable PEEP was 20 cmH2O). This does not reflect usual care at most institutions. While the investigators did not design the control arm of this trial to reflect usual care, the very high PEEP – FiO2 table used does have implications for the generalizability of the study’s findings to usual practice\n",
      "PES-guided PEEP titration is, in theory, most informative in patients with significantly elevated pleural pressure. This trial enrolled a heterogeneous cohort of patients with moderate to severe ARDS, many of whom likely did not have significant issues with chest wall elastance. It is possible that if the trial targeted patients with abnormal pleural pressure (e.g. significant obesity, ascites, chest wall deformities, etc.), the results may have been different\n",
      "The low utilization of prone positioning (only 4 patients total) is at odds with the strong recommendation for proning in patients with severe ARDS https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.201703-0548ST. The PROSEVA trial was published while this trial was recruiting\n",
      "The trial was underpowered for many of its secondary endpoints. As an example, the 95% confidence interval for 28-day mortality includes both significant benefit and significant harm (-11.1% – 14.6%) with PES-guided therapy\n",
      "PES measurements are only obtained at a single point in the mid-esophagus and therefore may be insensitive to regional heterogeneity in pleural pressure\n",
      "Additional sedation and neuromuscular blockade could be administered to facilitate PL It is not clear how frequently this was needed. Trial protocols which require deeper levels of sedation and neuromuscular blockade are likely to be increasingly seen as not reflective of best practice https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1901686\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "Routine use of PES-guided PEEP titration appears to offer little benefit over the use of empirical high PEEP – FiO2 in patients with moderate to severe ARDS\n",
      "This trial does not inform whether either strategy is superior to a less aggressive PEEP –FiO2 approach or one which prioritizes the early use of prone positioning\n",
      "The physiologic rationale for PES monitoring and the concept of PL are important to understand. Whether they can be used to advance the care of patients with ARDS remains to be seen\n",

      "In adult critically ill patients, with acute kidney injury, does early initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) compared to delayed initiation of RRT reduce the composite endpoint of MAKE365; consisting of death, RRT and persistent renal dysfunction at one year?\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "The optimal timing for initiation of RRT in patients with AKI is unknown.\n",
      "This trial looked at the 1 year outcomes of patients enrolled in the ELAIN trial.\n",
      "The ELAIN trial examined 90 day mortality of patients who were randomised to receive early RRT (within 8 hours of reaching KDIGO Stage 2) or delayed RRT (within 12 hours of reaching KDIGO Stage 3) or if they had an absolute indication for initiation of RRT.\n",
      "The ELAIN trial showed improved 90 day mortality (early vs delayed RRT) of 39.3% vs 54.7%, shorter duration of RRT (9 days vs 25 days), reduced ventilator time (125 hrs vs 181 hrs) and reduced hospital LOS (51 days vs 82 days).\n",
      "This trial aimed to determine if the beneficial intervention of early RRT was sustained at the 1 year mark.\n",
      "It is known that the mortality and morbidity after receiving RRT in ICU is high. For example, the POST-RENAL (prolonged outcomes after kidney injury requiring dialysis in the ICU) study suggested that at 4 years more than 60% of patients who had received dialysis in ICU were now dead and more than 5% of those who survived required ongoing dialysis.\n",
      "The STAART-AKI trial is currently recruiting. This trial is larger than ELAIN as it is aiming to recruit 2866 patients (vs 231 for ELAIN). It is comparing early RRT vs standard care. This study includes ICU adults with renal dysfunction who have i) A doubling of baseline creatinine OR ii) Cr >354umol/L OR iii) UO<0.5ml/kg/hr for 12 hours. The primary outcome is 90 day mortality and independence from RRT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Design\n",
      "\n",
      "The ELAIN trial was randomised, unblinded, single-centre with complete follow-up. Patients were allocated 1:1 for early vs late dialysis stratified by hemodynamic SOFA score.\n",
      "For patients discharged alive at 90 days, telephone calls were made to the general practitioner, subject or family member to determine if the patient was alive, if they were requiring RRT or if they had persistent renal dysfunction (defined as 25% decline in eGFR compared with baseline calculated with the Cockroft-Gault formula)\n",
      "In addition the relation of inflammatory biomarkers (collected at ICU Day 0 and Day 3) to the MAKE365 outcome was analysed.\n",

      "Small sample size, the effect of which can clearly be seen in some of the confidence interval ranges\n",
      "The trial was terminated early as recruitment numbers fell off as the COVID-19 incidence curve flattened in Greece. The required sample size was not met\n",
      "The only primary outcome that showed any benefit was the clinical outcome of a WHO R&D Blueprint Ordinal Clinical Scale and it had a Fragility index = 1. So this is not robust data\n",
      "This is a trial that is heavily sponsored by three pharmaceutical companies, though the authors state that those companies had no role in the trial design, management or reporting\n",
      "Power calculation was looking for a very optimistic target of a 50% reduction in the primary outcome. That’s an optimistic target and many studies looking for a 10-20% benefit fail to do so\n",
      "The study had 3 primary outcomes, two of which were not patient centred outcomes\n",
      "A large number of both clinical and laboratory data outcomes reported though some values were not recorded, such as IL-1 and 6. This is notable as the main proposed mechanism of action for colchicine is its anti-inflammatory activity\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "This small trial demonstrates another easy-to-start treatment (supply, administration route) that may have a benefit at ward level in reducing the number of patients that deteriorate to the level of needing ICU admission, primarily due to need for ventilator support; i.e. possibly a useful surge/crisis therapy\n",
      "However, the study numbers are small, the absolute benefit numbers even smaller and the confidence intervals are wide. Additionally the one clinical benefit demonstrated had a Fragility Index of 1. So this rates as a hypothesis generating study, not a practice changer\n",
      "Based on this trial, I will not be chasing my pharmacist to check out the supply robustness of colchicine yet\n",

      "“…this dose regimen of intravenous remdesivir was adequately tolerated but did not provide significant clinical or antiviral effects in seriously ill patients with COVID-19. However, we could not exclude clinically meaningful differences and saw numerical reductions in some clinical parameters.”\n",

      "Relatively large enrollment and well-designed trial in an area with a significant number of COVID-19 cases\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "Terminated early after stringent measures in Wuhan led to a decline in the number of patients presenting with COVID-19\n",
      "Power was not met; the lower enrollment reduced statistical power from 80% to 58%\n",
      "\n",
      "This exposes the study to increased Type II error (falsely negative results)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The median time to treatment with remdesivir was 10 days; this may be outside of the window of opportunity to benefit from the drug\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors state that they were unable to adequately assess whether earlier remdesivir treatment might have provided clinical benefit\n",
      "Limited hospital bed availability prevented admission earlier in disease progression\n",
      "The lack of impact on viral load may suggest that remdesivir was administered too late in the disease progression\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lopinavir–ritonavir was co-administered in 42 (18%) patients at baseline, however a previous study did not demonstrate lopinavir-ritonavir to be effective in patients with COVID-19 thus this may not have had a substantial confounding effect\n",
      "Absence of data on infectious virus recovery or on possible emergence of reduced susceptibility to remdesivir\n",
      "Most patients were in category 3 of the six-point ordinal scale of clinical status at baseline\n",
      "\n",
      "Is this the patient population most likely to benefit from remdesivir?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The frequent use of corticosteroids in our patient group might have promoted viral replication, as observed in SARS and MERS, although these studies only reported prolongation of the detection of viral RNA, not infectious virus”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "A relatively large but underpowered trial failed to demonstrate efficacy with intravenous remdesivir when administered relatively late in disease progression for COVID-19\n",

      "Both groups in this study were actually well matched for most interventions. The main difference was in the use of continuous SCVO2 measurement and CVP to guide management. Perhaps we should not completely dismiss the term ‘EGDT’. Afterall,  our ‘usual care’ consists of early intervention and goal directed therapy.

      "Treatment with a 7-day fixed-dose course of hydrocortisone or shock-dependent dosing of hydrocortisone (compared with no hydrocortisone) resulted in 93% and 80% probabilities of superiority with regard to the odds of improvement in organ support–free days within 21 days\n",
      "It is re-iterated that neither hydrocortisone groups met the pre-specified criteria for statistical superiority and thus definitive conclusions cannot be drawn\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "Multi-centre international, randomised trial with a pragmatic design\n",
      "The presentation of Bayesian results gives a “real-life” probability by which the treatment being tested may be beneficial:\n",
      "\n",
      "This appears easier to interpret for both clinicians and when discussing treatments with non clinicians\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of all patients, and not just those in the corticosteroid domain, enables the maximal amount of information available to be studied.\n",
      "\n",
      "This increases the accuracy of the adjustments made in the primary model (e.g. those for age, sex, time)\n",
      "The use of two analyses serves to confirm the stability of the results\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The prior based on information from ICNARC\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "15% (n = 15) of the no hydrocortisone group did receive a systemic corticosteroid, of which the median duration was 2 days\n",
      "\n",
      "All groups were allowed to receive systemic corticosteroid therapy if a new clinical indication allowed (e.g. post extubation stridor)\n",
      "It could be debated as to whether this would affect outcomes – if steroids are favourable, then the administration to the no hydrocortisone group would only likely serve to reduce the probability by which corticosteroid administration is deemed to be beneficial\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Only 43% in the shock group received at least 1 dose of hydrocortisone\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors state that if corticosteroids are beneficial in COVID-19 (in ways other then mitigating shock) then this group maybe under-treated\n",
      "\n",
      "This may result in the 80% probability being underestimated\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With regards to patient selection:\n",
      "\n",
      "of the 1165 patients assessed, 42 of these were excluded as the clinician intended to administer corticosteroids, and of the 614 who met the severe COVID-19 definition, 38 were excluded as the clinician intended to administer corticosteroids\n",
      "\n",
      "This may result in some selection bias as this is ~7% of all patients assessed\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Groups not completely balanced at baseline – lower use of mechanical ventilation and vasopressors in the arm that received no corticosteroids\n",
      "Trial not blinded\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors make a very rational argument that blinding would have impacted significantly on the speed in which this trial was set up and able to enrol patients (which is important in a pandemic)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6% of patients withdrew consent or did not have outcome data available. There is concern of this introducing bias, particularly in an open label trial\n",
      "No low income countries randomised, and a large proportion (n = 419 in all domains) were randomised from the UK\n",
      "The cessation of the trial earlier than planned meant that the pre-defined statistical triggers were not reached and thus definitive statistical conclusions can not be drawn\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the trial was open label this was important to minimise (although highly unlikely) any protocol violations given the strongly positive effects shown in RECOVERY\n",
      "The authors acknowledge that no optimal strategy of corticosteroid use is shown by this study\n",
      "Prescott and Rice in their JAMA editorial highlight many further clinical questions that still need to be answered\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that such a large, international trial has been so rapidly and rigorously conducted alongside a significant burden of clinical critical care work is remarkably impressive\n",
      "Although no statistical triggers were reached, the Bayesian approach gives a high probability of superiority of corticosteroid use (compared to no corticosteroid use) in organ support free days within 21 days. It also reported a large reduction in the progression to invasive ventilation, ECMO or death with the use of steroids\n",
      "Medicine is a balance of benefit and risk. With the high probability of benefit and low evidence of harm from this study, combined with the evidence from the RECOVERY trial and the WHO meta-analysis, I will continue to advocate for the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19\n",

      "Tranexamic acid has previously been thought to be a wonder drug in terms of bleeding, but many recent negative studies looking at effectiveness of TXA haltering bleeding at various sites, suggest that its use needs to be refined (CRASH 2, WOMAN, TICH-2 etc)\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Authors’ Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "Among patients with septic shock, a resuscitation strategy targeting normalization of capillary refill time, compared with a strategy targeting serum lactate levels, did not reduce all cause 28-day mortality\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "Multinational, randomized controlled trial, with allocation concealment\n",
      "Registered with ClinicalTrials.gov and pre-published statistical plan\n",
      "Time from eligibility to randomisation of 1.4 hours suggesting an early intervention\n",
      "Rapid recruitment (1 year)\n",
      "CRT assessment was standardised (using a chronometer, staff training, auditing, and periodic reinforcement)\n",
      "Reflects contemporary practices (eg fluid responsiveness)\n",
      "Good adherence to the protocol, with no loss to follow-up\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "Underpowered to answer the study question\n",
      "\n",
      "The sample size was calculated based on an ARR of mortality of 15%, which is unrealistic for most resuscitation based sepsis studies\n",
      "Therefore although the study resulted in a 8.5% mortality difference, this did not meet the pre-specified significance level (P=0.06)\n",
      "Thus there was a high chance of a type II (false negative) error\n",
      "A formal bayesian analysis would potentially allow a more nuanced interpretation of the trial\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Non blinding of clinicians may have led to additional changes in management resulting in bias for the intervention\n",
      "\n",
      "CRT group also required additional staff education while the lactate group did not, again potentially favouring the CRT intervention\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While both arms had CRT assessments every 30 minutes, protocol adjustments were only made every 2 hours for the lactate group\n",
      "\n",
      "The reduced frequency of protocol adjustments may have biased the result against the lactate group\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Complex intervention, making the causal relationship of outcome difficult to explain\n",
      "\n",
      "The two arms of the study triggered a complex protocol, of which parts lack a strong evidence base, and which may have biased the results for or against improved outcomes\n",
      "Furthermore, parts of the protocol are advanced (fluid responsiveness, vasopressor and inodilator assessments) and may not be generalisable to other hospitals\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The combination of a lactate based strategy and CRT strategy was not tested\n",
      "Although the CRT technique was standardised, there has been relatively little literature on this technique, and no evaluation of the inter-rater variability was conducted in the trial\n",
      "Day 28 mortality as a primary outcome in sepsis trials has been shown to still be unstable, and most major trials now using day 90\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "This study suggests the exclusive use of CRT is a possible alternative to lactate as a resuscitation target in sepsis, especially in resource poor settings where lactate measurement is not routinely available\n",
      "My practise is to use a combination of lactate clearance and capillary return, which this study did not address, and therefore it will not change my practice.\n",
      "Further adequately powered studies, with validation of the CRT technique in other settings and countries, will be needed to make CRT my exclusive target for sepsis resuscitation\n",
