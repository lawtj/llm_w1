Standard versus  Accelerated Initiation of Renal Replacement Therapy
====================================================================

Wald R, Bagshaw S. NEJM July 16 2020 doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2000741

### Clinical Question

*   In critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury, does accelerated initiation of renal replacement therapy compared to standard initiation improve 90 day survival?

### Background

*   Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and some case series suggest up to 2/3rds of ICU patients develop some degree of renal impairment. Up to 50% of these patients may need dialysis which increases the complexity and cost of the care of the critically ill. Patients with critical illness and AKI have a high mortality.
*   The purported rationale for early dialysis include: achieving optimal fluid balance via ultrafiltration, removal of toxic solutes that may mitigate the inflammatory milieu and correcting metabolic acidosis that may contribute to haemodynamic instability
*   The purported rationale for delaying dialysis include: less procedural related risk to the patient, avoidance in some situations of an unnecessary intervention if the patient’s renal function improves spontaneously, resource rationing and avoidance of iatrogenic hypovolaemia from excessive ultrafiltration.
*   Previously, there have been several trials conducted exploring the optimal timing of renal replacement therapy.
    *   The [AKIKI](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/akiki/)
         trial looked at a predominantly medical cohort of patients with AKI & consequent metabolic derangement, and randomised them to early or late dialysis. At Day 60, there was no difference in mortality. Patients in this trial could receive intermittent or continuous dialysis.
    *   The [ELAIN](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/elain/)
         trial looked at a predominantly surgical cohort of patients with AKI (KDIGO stage 3) and randomised to early or late dialysis. The hazard ratio of death at day 90 was 0.66 in favour of the early initiation strategy (95% CI 0.45 to 0.97; p-value = 0.03). However, the fragility of this trial was 3.
    *   The [IDEAL](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/ideal-icu/)
         trial studied patients with septic shock and acute kidney injury. This randomised controlled trial that was stopped early due to futility, found no difference in mortality with the use of early vs. delayed renal replacement therapy

### Design

*   The **STARRT-AKI** trial (**ST**andard versus **A**ccelerated Initiation of **R**enal **R**eplacement **T**herapy in **A**cute **K**idney **I**njury trial)
*   Open-labeled
*   Randomised controlled trial. Participants were randomised 1:1 to accelerated versus standard initiation of RRT
*   Variable block sizes and stratified to centre
*   Allocation concealment via a web-based randomisation system
*   Trial protocol and statistical analysis plan published prior to publication
*   The trial was powered at 90% to detect an absolute difference of 6% between groups, based on a 90-day mortality of 40% in the standard group. Given this, the sample size was calculated at 2866 patients and increased to 3000 to account for attrition, eg loss to follow-up
*   Pre-specified subgroups were patient sex, eGFR, surgical patients, geographical region, septic patients, SAP II score
*   Written informed consent was obtained from the patient or substitute decision maker in keeping with the individual institutional standards

### Setting

*   Multi-national: 15 countries
*   Multi-centre: 168 sites
*   Patients were randomised from October 2015 to September 2019

### Population

*   **Inclusion**:
    *   \>18 years
    *   Admission to an ICU
    *   AKI defined as Cr>100umol/L in women and Cr>130umol/L in men and had not declined by >27umol/l in 48 hours
    *   Evidence of severe AKI with at least 1 of the following 3:
        *   \> 2-fold increase in creatinine from baseline
        *   Cr >354umol/L and >27umol/L above baseline creatinine
        *   Urine output <6ml/kg in 12 hours
*   **Exclusion**:
    *   K >5.5mmol/L
    *   HCO3 <15mmol/L
    *   A drug overdose that necessitated dialysis
    *   Lack of commitment to provide RRT due to treatment limitations
    *   Any RRT in last 2 months
    *   Kidney transplant in last year
    *   Known pre-hospital ESRF with eGRF <20ml/min/1.73m2
    *   Presence of renal obstruction, rapidly progressive GN, vasculitis, thrombotic microangiopathy or AIN
*   Once all inclusion and no exclusion criteria were met the patient could be randomised to the trial providing there was true clinician equipoise, ie it was not felt that immediate RRT was mandated or that deferred RRT was mandated. More than 7000 patients were excluded at this point due to lack of equipoise
*   Once all inclusion and no exclusion criteria were met this marked a time point and consent needed to be obtained within 12 hours. Randomisation to the accelerated or standard arm then occurred.
*   3021 patients:1512 to accelerated arm, 1507 to standard arm
*   2927 patients; 1465 and 1462 patients were analysed for the primary outcome (modified intention-to-treat-analysis) as a total of 42 patients were either lost to follow up or withdrew consent.
*   The baseline characteristics were similar between groups with 75% of patients mechanically ventilated and the mean Creatinine at randomisation 300umol/L

### Intervention

*   Patients randomised to the accelerated arm needed to commence continuous renal replacement therapy within 12 hours of randomisation
    *   96.8% received dialysis
    *   The average time to commencement was 6 hours
    *   The average creatinine at time of commencement was 327umol/L and fluid balance positive 2714ml

### Control

*   Clinicians caring for patients randomised to the standard group were discouraged from commencing RRT unless:
    *   Persistent AKI, with Cr >50% the value recorded at randomisation
*   AND one or more of:
*   *   K+>6mmol/L
    *   pH < 7.2 or HCO3 <12mmol/L
    *   Fluid overload causing respiratory compromise (PaO2/FiO2<200)
    *   Persistent AKI for >72 hours from randomisation
*   There was no obligation to commence RRT in the standard group arm even if the above criteria were met, eg if K is 6.3mmol/L, the clinician could manage it with medical therapy. Conversely, RRT could be commenced at any time deemed suitable based on the judgement of the attending clinician
*   61.8% of patients in the standard group received dialysis
*   The average creatinine at the time of RRT commencement was 433umol/L and fluid balance positive 5893ml

#### Management common to both groups

*   The modality of RRT was at the discretion of the treating physician (there were guidelines provided): Comparing the accelerated vs standard groups, most received continuous RRT (68.4% vs 70.6%), then IHD (27% vs 25.3%), then SLED (4.6% vs 4.1%)
*   Citrate was the most common form of circuit anticoagulation
*   RRT would continue until one of the following was encountered
    1.  Death
    2.  Withdrawal of life-support
    3.  Kidney Function Recovered

### Outcome

*   **Primary outcome**: 90 Day Mortality (Accelerated vs Standard)
    *   **NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE** 643/1465 (43.9%) vs 639/1462 (43.7%) RR= 1, (95% CI 0.93-1.09), p=0.92 (modified ITT analysis)
    *   Adjusted OR 1.05 (95% CI 0.9-1.23) \[This took into account baseline characteristics of the patients\]
*   **Secondary outcome**: (Accelerated vs Standard) included:
    *   **Significant difference** in:
        *   Dependence on RRT at Day 90 after randomisation (10.4% vs 6%), RR 1.74 (95% CI 1.24-2.43)
        *   Patients in the accelerated group had a shorter ICU stay than the standard group (9 days vs 10 days)
    *   **No significant difference** in:
        *   Composite of all cause mortality and RRT dependence at D90
        *   Major adverse kidney event (composite of death, RRT dependence or sustained reduction in kidney function)
        *   eGFR at D90
        *   Albuminuria at D90
        *   Mortality in ICU, D28, hospital
        *   RRT free days at D90
        *   Mechanical ventilation free days at D28
        *   Vasoactive therapy-free days through D28
*   Sub-groups: there was no significant difference in any of the pre-specified subgroups
*   Adverse events were more common in the accelerated arm (23% v 16.5%), particularly hypotension and hypophosphataemia
*   Serious adverse events were not significantly different (1% vs 0.5%)

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   In critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury, an accelerated strategy for the initiation of renal-replacement therapy did not result in a lower mortality at 90 days than a standard strategy

### Strengths

*   Allocation concealment, intention to treat analysis, blinding of outcome assessors, near-complete follow-up (internal validity)
*   Stratification by centre and allocation in variable block size (allowing the clinician to have little chance of predicting the allocation prior to randomisation)
*   Patients were analysed by the group they were allocated to even thought there was a 7.5% cross-over in therapies between groups
*   Pragmatic design which reflects the real world: if the clinician did not have absolute equipoise regarding providing accelerated or standard provision of RRT then they were not included in the trial
*   Clinically meaningful outcomes
*   The funding organisations and partners were not involved in the design, implementation, management of the trial, analysis of data or publication
*   The trial results are widely applicable as patients were recruited from many different ICUs in many different countries (external validity)
*   There was a clear differentiation between groups in term of creatinine and fluid balance at the time of RRT commencement
*   There were 3 interim analyses conducted to confirm that continuation of the trial was safe

### Weaknesses

*   Equipoise is difficult to define: it would be useful to see the data on the patients whom were excluded because the treating clinician felt accelerated or delayed RRT was mandated
*   It will be interesting to see the planned economic analysis of STARRT-AKI

### The Bottom Line

*   There appears to be no benefit in starting renal replacement in an accelerated fashion
*   In addition early dialysis appears to increase the risk of dependence on long term renal replacement therapy raising the possibility these patients are of risk of  dialysis induced kidney injury

    Hi,
    
    Thanks for good analysis. However, there might be a small error in definition on Inclusion criteria.
    
    In the original article: ´kidney dysfunction (serum creatinine level, ≥1.13 mg per deciliter \[100 μmol per liter\] in women and ≥1.47 mg per deciliter \[130 μmol per liter\] in men) ´
    
    And in Your analysis:\` AKI defined as Cr>100umol/L in men and Cr>130umol/L in women and had not declined by >27umol/l in 48 hours\`
    
    If I understand correctly, definion has been swiched in man and female.

    Excellent summary.  
    A potentially confusing typo, however. You state that ATN is an exclusion criteria (but probably almost all the patients had tubular injury). Looks like that should read AIN (interstitial nephritis).  
    Keep up the awesome work.

    I wonder how the mortality rate was in those patients in the standatd strategy group who eventually required RRT. In AKIKI and IDEAL-ICU, these “late-RRT” patients had the worst survival probability.

Long-Term Clinical Outcomes after Early Initiation of RRT in Critically Ill Patients with AKI
=============================================================================================

Meersch M. J Am Soc Nephrol 29:Dec 2017 doi:10.1681ASN.2017060694

### Clinical Question

*   In adult critically ill patients, with acute kidney injury, does early initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) compared to delayed initiation of RRT reduce the composite endpoint of MAKE365; consisting of death, RRT and persistent renal dysfunction at one year?

### Background

*   The optimal timing for initiation of RRT in patients with AKI is unknown.
*   This trial looked at the 1 year outcomes of patients enrolled in the [ELAIN](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/elain/)
     trial.
*   The ELAIN trial examined 90 day mortality of patients who were randomised to receive early RRT (within 8 hours of reaching KDIGO Stage 2) or delayed RRT (within 12 hours of reaching KDIGO Stage 3) or if they had an absolute indication for initiation of RRT.
*   The ELAIN trial showed improved 90 day mortality (early vs delayed RRT) of 39.3% vs 54.7%, shorter duration of RRT (9 days vs 25 days), reduced ventilator time (125 hrs vs 181 hrs) and reduced hospital LOS (51 days vs 82 days).
*   This trial aimed to determine if the beneficial intervention of early RRT was sustained at the 1 year mark.
*   It is known that the mortality and morbidity after receiving RRT in ICU is high. For example, the POST-RENAL (prolonged outcomes after kidney injury requiring dialysis in the ICU) study suggested that at 4 years more than 60% of patients who had received dialysis in ICU were now dead and more than 5% of those who survived required ongoing dialysis.
*   The STAART-AKI trial is currently recruiting. This trial is larger than ELAIN as it is aiming to recruit 2866 patients (vs 231 for ELAIN). It is comparing early RRT vs standard care. This study includes ICU adults with renal dysfunction who have i) A doubling of baseline creatinine OR ii) Cr >354umol/L OR iii) UO<0.5ml/kg/hr for 12 hours. The primary outcome is 90 day mortality and independence from RRT.

### Design

*   The [ELAIN](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/elain/)
     trial was randomised, unblinded, single-centre with complete follow-up. Patients were allocated 1:1 for early vs late dialysis stratified by hemodynamic SOFA score.
*   For patients discharged alive at 90 days, telephone calls were made to the general practitioner, subject or family member to determine if the patient was alive, if they were requiring RRT or if they had persistent renal dysfunction (defined as 25% decline in eGFR compared with baseline calculated with the Cockroft-Gault formula)
*   In addition the relation of inflammatory biomarkers (collected at ICU Day 0 and Day 3) to the MAKE365 outcome was analysed.
*   1 year outcomes were available for all but one patient

### Setting

*   University Hospital Munster, Gemany
*   ELAIN recruited from August 2013 to December 2015

### Population

*   Inclusion: must have met all five of the following

*   Development or progression of non-renal organ dysfunction (SOFA organ system score ≥2)

4\. Age between 18 and 90

5\. Intention to provide full intensive care treatment for at least 3 days

*   Delivered to 100% of patients assigned to early group
    *   Median time to RRT was 6.0 hours (IQR 4.0-7.0)

**Control**

*   Inititation of RRT within 12 hours of either
    *   KDIGO stage 3 criteria
        *   Creatinine rise >3 fold increase from baseline, or oliguria <0.3ml/kg/hr for ≡24 hours or serum creatinine > 4mg/dl (353.6 umol/l) with an acute increase of at least 0.5mg/dl (44.2umol/l) within 24 hours
    *   Absolute indication for RRT
        *   Urea >100mg/dl
        *   Potassium >6mmol/l and or ECG abnormalities
        *   Magnesium >4mmol/l and/or anuria/absence of deep tendon reflexes
        *   Blood pH <7.15
        *   Urine production <200ml/12hr or anuria
        *   Organ oedema in the presence of AKI resistant to diuretic treatment (defined as one trial of furosemide)
*   Delivered to 91% of patients assigned to delayed group
    *   Median time to RRT was 25.5 hours (IQR 18.8-40.3)

### **Common to both groups**

    *   citrate anticoagulation
*   RRT discontinued if renal recovery evident by both:
    *   \> 400ml urine  in 24hr without diuretics or > 2100ml in 24hr with diuretics
    *   creatine clearance > 20ml/min occurred
*   RRT could be changed to SLED after 7 days if no recovery
*   Additional treatments (ventilation, nutrition) standardized
*   Follow up up to 1 year post randomization

### Outcome

*   Primary outcome: MAKE365 score at 1 year (a composite of persistent renal dysfunction, dialysis dependence and mortality) \[Early vs Delayed\]
    *   64.9% vs 89.1% p<0.001 (OR 0.23 \[0.11-0.24\])

    *   Number needed to treat: 5
*   Secondary outcomes:
    *   1 year all cause mortality \[Early vs Delayed\]
        *   50.2% vs 69.8% p<0.01 (OR 0.62 \[0.44-0.87\])
    *   Increase in mortality between day 90 and 1 year
        *   Early group: 39.3% to 50.2%
        *   Delayed group: 54.7% to 69.8%
    *   Failure to recover renal function p=0.001
        *   Early group: 29.1% (16 of 55)
        *   Delayed group: 63.9% (23 of 36)
    *   Need for RRT at 1 year p=0.71
        *   Early group: 7.3% (4 of 55)
        *   Delayed group: 11.1% (4/36)
*   Exploratory biomarker analysis: 159 of 204 patients had biomarkers measured on day 0 and 3 after randomisation (Pro-inflammatory: MIF, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-18 and Anti-inflammatory: IL-10 and TNFR-1 and TNFR-2)
    *   Elevated TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 at Day 3 were higher in those who met the MAKE365 end point. Elevations in the other markers were not associated with MAKE365 positive group.

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   In this cohort of critically ill patients with AKI, after 1 year, early initiation of RRT compared with delayed RRT continues to have a benefit on a composite outcome of mortality, dialysis dependence and renal function.

### Strengths

*   Only one patient lost to follow-up at 1 year
*   An important question: is RRT in the ICU setting merely supportive or can it influence patient centred outcomes and does the timing of initiation influence this?
*   Intention to treat analysis; those in the delayed group who did not receive dialysis (11 patients; 6 did not progress to Stage 3, 4 reached Stage 3 but did not get dialysis, 1 did not get dialysis as no machine available) were analysed in the group they were randomised to

### Weaknesses

*   Single centred
*   Unblinded
*   Mainly post-surgical cohort with high proportion of post-cardiac surgery cases, making the generalisability difficult
*   The study is small and likely underpowered. The fragility index of the original ELAIN study was only 3.
*   The primary outcome was not included in the trial [protocol](https://www.drks.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00004367)
    . The only 1 year outcome pre-specified in the trial protocol was all cause mortality.

### The Bottom Line

*   The results suggest that early RRT, in predominantly post-operative patients with Stage 2 AKI, positively influences mortality and other patient centred outcomes at 1 year.
*   Renal replacement therapy does carry cost and some risk to patients, so although this encourages me to use RRT early, I await the results of the STAART-AKI trial, which will be invaluable in answering the important question of the optimal timing of RRT in critically ill patients.

Initiation Strategies for Renal-Replacement  
Therapy in the Intensive Care Unit
================================================================================

Gaudry. N Engl J Med 2016; 375:122-133. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1603017

### Clinical Question

*   In critically ill patients with acute kidney injury does delayed compared with early initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) reduce mortality at 60 days?

### Design

*   Randomised controlled trial
    *   Computer-generated
    *   Variable block size
    *   Stratified by centre
*   Non-blinded
*   Follow up for 60 days post randomisation
*   Sample size calculation: sample size of 546 patients would have 90% power to demonstrate a 15% absolute risk reduction from a baseline mortality of 55%, with a false positive rate of 5%.

### Setting

*   31 ICUs in France
*   September 2013 – January 2016

### Population

*   Inclusion criteria: Critically ill adult patients with severe acute kidney injury
    *   Age ≥18
    *   Receiving invasive ventilation and/or catecholamine infusion (adrenaline/noradrenaline)
    *   Admitted to the ICU with acute kidney injury that was compatible with diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis in the context of ischaemic or toxic injury
    *   Within 5 hours of validation of KDIGO stage 3 kidney injury, defined by at least 1 of the following
        *   Creatinine >354 µmol/litre or greater than 3\* baseline
        *   Anuria (urine output <100ml/day) for >12 hours
        *   Oliguria (urine output <0.3ml/kg/h or <500ml/day) for >24 hours
*   Exclusion criteria:
    *   Pre-existing severe chronic renal failure (Creatinine clearance <30ml/min)
    *   Cardiac arrest without awakening
    *   Severe laboratory abnormalities
        *   Urea >40mmol/l, K >6mmol/l (or >5.5 despite medical treatment), pH <7.15 in context in context of either pure metabolic acidosis or mixed acidosis
    *   Acute pulmonary oedema due to fluid overload causing severe hypoxaemia
        *   Requirement of >5l/min oxygen to maintain SpO2 >95%, or requiring FiO2 >50% in ventilated patients despite diuresis
*   620 patients randomised out of 5528 patients assessed

Comparing intervention vs control group, well matched at baseline apart from prothrombin ratio

*   Age: 64.8 vs. 67.4
*   Serum creatinine before ICU admission: 0.95 mg/dl vs. 0.97 mg/dl
*   Chronic renal failure: 7% vs. 12%
*   SOFA score at enrollment: 10.9 vs. 10.8
*   Exposure to nephrotoxic agent in past 2 days: 62% vs. 63%
*   Invasive mechanical ventilation: 86% vs. 87%
*   Vasopressor support with adrenaline/noradrenaline: 85% vs. 85%
*   Septic shock: 67% vs. 66%
*   Oliguria/anuria: 65% vs. 62%
*   Prothrombin ratio: 57.1% vs. 53.5%

### Intervention

*   Early renal replacement therapy (n=312)
    *   Aimed to start within 6 hours of documentation of stage 3 KDIGO acute kidney injury
    *   Started at median 4.3 hours (IQR 2.7-5.9) post documentation of stage 3 injury and fulfillment of other inclusion criteria
    *   6 patients did not receive RRT

### Control

*   Delayed renal replacement therapy (n=308)
    *   Renal replacement therapy initiated if patient developed any of the following
        *   Severe laboratory abnormalities: Urea >40mmol/l, K >6mmol/l (or >5.5 despite medical treatment), pH <7.15 in context in context of either pure metabolic acidosis or mixed acidosis
        *   Acute pulmonary oedema due to fluid overload causing severe hypoxaemia (as defined in exclusion criteria)
        *   Oliguria/anuria lasted for >72 hours post randomisation
    *   51% of patients received RRT at a median of 57 hours (IQR 25-83) post randomisation
    *   Median interval between occurrence of at least 1 criteria mandating RRT and its initiation was 4.7 hours (IQR 1.7-10.0)
    *   Five patients received RRT without meeting criteria

Comparing early vs. delayed group

*   Medical treatment of acute kidney injury related metabolic complication prior to receiving RRT
    *   Diuretics: 1.3% vs. 36.5%, p<0.001
    *   Medical treatment of acidosis: 6.8% vs. 16.7%, p<0.001

In both groups

*   Choice of method of RRT, duration, interval between sessions, anticoagulation, was at discretion of physicians
    *   Over 50% received intermittent RRT
    *   30% received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) as sole method
*   Discontinuation of RRT
    *   Considered if spontaneous urine output >500ml/24 hours
    *   Highly recommended if spontaneous urine output >1000ml/24 hours  (>2000ml/24 hours in patients receiving diuretics)
    *   Mandatory if diuresis was sufficient to allow for spontaneous decrease in serum creatinine concentration
*   RRT resumed if diuresis insufficient to result in spontaneous decrease in creatinine level or if urine output <1000ml/24 hours (or <2000ml/24 hours in patients receiving diuretics)

### Outcome

*   Primary outcome: mortality at 60 days – no significant difference
    *   48.5% in early vs. 49.7% in delayed, P=0.79, Hazard ratio 1.03 (95% C.I. 0.82-1.29)
    *   Fragility index: -21 patients (Number of patients lost to follow up = 6)
*   Secondary outcome: comparing early vs. delayed
    *   Mortality at 28 days – no significant difference
        *   41.6% vs. 43.5%
    *   Received renal replacement therapy – significantly higher in early group
        *   98% vs. 51%, p<0.001
    *   Median length of ICU stay – no significant difference
        *   Survivors: 13 days vs. 13 days, p=0.87
        *   Non-survivors: 6 days vs. 6 days, p=0.92
    *   Median length of hospital stay – no significant difference
        *   Survivors: 29 vs. 32 days, p=0.58
        *   Non-survivors: 6 vs. 6 days, p=0.85
    *   Patients with catheter related nosocomial infection – significantly higher in early group
        *   10% vs. 5%, p=0.03
    *   Dependency on RRT – no significant difference
        *   At day 28: 12% vs. 10%, p=0.51
        *   At day 60: 2% vs. 5%, p=0.12
    *   Proportion of patients with diuresis of >1000ml urine /24 hours (or >2000ml if had diuretics) significantly higher in delayed group, p=0.003
*   Post-hoc analysis
    *   Mortality at 60 days
        *   Delayed RRT group but never received RRT: 37.1%
        *   Early RRT: 48.5%
        *   Delayed RRT group and received RRT: 61.8%
        *   p<0.0001
    *   SOFA score at baseline, median (IQR)
        *   Delayed RRT group but never received RRT: 10 (8-12)
        *   Early RRT group: 11 (9-13)
        *   Delayed RRT group and received RRT: 12 (9-14)
        *   p<0.0001

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   In critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury, an early compared with a delayed initiation of renal replacement therapy showed no difference in mortality.

### Strengths

*   Randomised controlled trial
*   Multi-centre
*   Adequately powered
*   Defined criteria for initiation of RRT

### Weaknesses

*   For over 50% of patients the initial modality of RRT was intermittent RRT. This was despite the fact that 85% of patients required vasopressor support upon initiation of RRT. This may limit the external validity as this is not standard practice in the UK.
*   A limitation that the authors state is that the study only included patients with advanced kidney injury, and therefore the results may not be generalisable to patients with less severe kidney injuries.
*   Non-blinded – although unavoidable the unblinded clinician also directed care which may introduce bias.

### The Bottom Line

*   In critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury, an early approach to RRT did not provide a mortality benefit compared to a delayed approach; when the RRT modality was predominately intermittent RRT.
*   ~50% of the patients in the delayed group did not receive RRT
*   There was a significantly higher rate of catheter related nosocmial infections in the early group

Timing of Renal-Replacement Therapy in Patients with Acute Kidney Injury and Sepsis
===================================================================================

Barba. NEJM 2018;379:1431-1442

### Clinical Question

*   In patients with septic shock and severe acute kidney injury, does early vs. delayed renal replacement therapy improve 90 day mortality?

### Background

*   Acute kidney injury is a common occurrence in patients with septic shock. The decision as to when to start renal replacement therapy is controversial
*   The [AKIKI](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/akiki/)
     trial reported no difference in mortality with an early vs. a delayed approach, whereas the [ELAIN](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/elain/)
     trial found a significant mortality benefit with the early approach
*   There are some key differences between these two randomized trials that are summarized in our previous [editorial](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/blog/editorial/early-vs-late-rrt/)
    

### Design

*   Randomised controlled trial
*   Open-label / non-blinded
*   Computer generated randomisation, stratification according to age, centre and SOFA score
*   Intention to treat analysis
*   Registered on [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01682590)
    
*   864 patients required to give 80% power, to detect a 10% absolute risk reduction from a baseline mortality of 55%, with a 2 sided alpha level of 0.05
*   2 planned interim analyses
*   Stopped early due to futility
    *   Conditional power calculated when trial terminated was 51%

### Setting

*   29 ICUs in France (22 university teaching hospital and 7 general hospitals)
*   Data collected July 2012 – October 2016

### Population

*   **Inclusion**: Adult patients with septic shock and acute renal failure
    *   Septic shock defined as severe sepsis with >=2 SIRS criteria and need for vasopressors despite adequate vascular filling
    *   Within 48 hours of starting vasopressors
    *   Acute renal failure defined as “failure” stage of RIFLE classification i.e. the presence of >=1 of the following:
        *   Increased creatinine
            *   x3 baseline value, or
            *   \>4 mg/dl (350 umol/l) accompanied by rapid increase of >0.5 mg/dl (44 umol/l)
        *   Oliguria <0.3ml/kg/hr for 12 hours
        *   Anuria: diuresis <100ml for 12 hours
*   **Exclusion**: Chronic renal failure requiring dialysis, obstructive renal failure, emergency criteria for immediate haemodialysis (K > 6.5, pH <7.15 or pulmonary oedema by fluid overload), moribund or unlikely to survive to 28 days because of uncontrolled co-morbitiies, DNAR in place
*   488 patients randomised out of 1728 who were assessed for eligibility
*   Comparing intervention vs. control group – no significant differences in baseline characteristics
    *   Age: 69 vs. 69
    *   Male: 58% vs. 64%
    *   Chronic renal failure: 13% vs. 18%
    *   Diabetes: 33% vs. 29%
    *   SOFA score at enrollement: 12.2 vs. 12.4
    *   Exposure to at least 1 nephrotoxic drug in preceding 4 days: 52% vs. 44%
    *   Invasive mechanical ventilation: 89% vs. 88%
    *   Vasopressor requirement: 100% vs. 100%
    *   Diagnostic criteria for ‘failure’ stage of RIFLE classification
        *   Oliguria: 35% vs. 33%
        *   Anuria: 34% vs. 36%
        *   Serum creatinine 3 times baseline: 63% vs. 62%
    *   Fluid balance pre-enrollement ml/24 hour: +3194 vs. +3211

### Intervention

*   **Early initiation of RRT**
    *   Start of RRT within 12 hours of documentation of ‘failure-stage’ acute kidney injury
    *   97% of patients received RRT

### Control

*   **Deferred initiation of RRT**
    *   RRT initiated after a delay of 48 hours post-diagnosis of ‘failure-stage’ of acute kidney injury, if renal function had not spontaneously recovered or criteria for emergency RRT had been met
    *   62% of patients received RRT at any time
    *   17% of patients received RRT earlier than 48 hours due to criteria for emergent RRT being met
    *   29% did not receive RRT because renal function spontaneosly recovered
    *   8% died before RRT initiated

#### Management common to both groups

*    Choice of RRT (intermittent vs. continuous) was at discretion of clinician, but had to adhere to protocol instructions for setting  
    • In cases of life threatening conditions (K >6.5mmol, metabolic acidosis with pH < 7.15, pulmonary oedema that was refractory to diuretics) within the 48 hours after randomisation, RRT initiated as soon as possible  
    • In case of improvement of renal function within the 48 hours post randomisation (return of spontaneous urine output >1000ml/24hr or >2000ml/hr with diuretics), RRT is not mandatory

### Outcome

*   **Primary outcome**:  All cause 90 day mortality – no significant difference
    *   58% in early strategy vs. 54% in delayed, p=0.38
*   **Secondary outcomes** – comparing early vs. delayed strategy
    *   Significantly lower:
        *   Median time from diagnosis of AKI to RRT
            *   7.6 vs. 51.5 hours, p<0.001
        *   Days free of RRT
            *   12 vs. 16, p=0.0006
        *   Episodes of hyperkalaemia
            *   0% vs. 4%, p=0.03
    *   No significant differences in:
        *   Median days free of mechanical ventilation: 2 vs. 3
        *   Median days free of vasopressors: 16 vs. 17
        *   Median length of hospital stay: 23 vs. 23 days
        *   Dependence on RRT amongst survivors at day 90: 2% vs. 3%
        *   Fluid overload: <1% vs. 4%
        *   Severe bleeding event: 5% vs. 6%

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   In patients with septic shock and severe acute kidney injury there was no difference in mortality for patients assigned to an early compared with a late strategy for renal replacement therapy

### Strengths

*   Randomised controlled trial
*   Patient centered outcome
*   Intention to treat analysis
*   Registered on clinicaltrials.gov
*   Minimal loss to follow up

### Weaknesses

*   Non-blinded – unrealistic to blind clinicians but authors could have been blinded during data collection and analysis
*   Stopped early due to futility with resultant decrease in power
*   Use of both continuous and intermittent RRT allowed which is not consistent with practice in UK

### The Bottom Line

*   In patients with septic shock and acute kidney injury, this randomized controlled trial that was stopped early due to futility, found no difference in mortality with the use of early vs. delayed renal replacement therapy
*   Use of the delayed strategy resulted in a reduction of the number of patients that required renal replacement therapy
