Hydrocortisone in Severe Community Acquired Pneumonia
=====================================================

P.F. Dequin et al. NEJM. 2023 DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2215145

### Clinical Question

*   In patients with severe community acquired pneumonia (CAP) does the use of hydrocortisone compared to a placebo reduce 28-day mortality?

### Background

*   Severe CAP has significant associated morbidity and mortality with up to 10% of those admitted to hospital requiring ICU admission
*   The use of steroids in CAP has been contentious with differing recommendations in various society guidelines
    *   The [ATS / ISDA](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.201908-1581ST#_i6)
         recommend against their use in severe CAP, however the [ESICM / SCCM](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-017-4951-5)
         guidelines favour their use
*   The recently published trial by [Meduri et al](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-022-06684-3)
     showed no 60-day mortality benefit with the use of methylprednisolone in severe CAP. However, the conclusion in the [associated editorial](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-022-06699-w)
     calls for further large scale RCTs before strong recommendations are made with respect to this intervention

### Design

*   Double blind, placebo controlled, multi-centre RCT
*   Centralised randomisation using a web-based system
*   1:1 ratio in block sizes of 4
    *   Stratified according to trial site and the use of mechanical ventilation
*   Placebo identically packaged
*   Power calculation
    *   1146 patients needed to provide 80% power to detect a 25% relative risk reduction in mortality from a baseline of 27%
*   COVID-19 meant that recruitment was paused after 800 randomised as the trial group focused on a separate trial evaluating the use of hydrocortisone in COVID-19
*   DSMB recommended discontinuation of enrolment at planned second interim analysis
    *   This was based on: (1) felt to be unethical to continue to include placebo group, (2) the prolonged suspension and (3) another 400 patients unlikely to change outcome

### Setting

*   31 French centres
*   October 2015 to March 2020

### Population

*   **Inclusion**:
    *   Age > 18
    *   Admission to ICU
    *   CAP diagnosis suggested by ≥ 2 of cough, purulent sputum, chest pain and dyspnoea
    *   Focal shadowing on CXR / CT scan
    *   Severe disease defined by at least 1 of the following:
        *   Pulmonary severity index (PSI) score > 130
        *   Mechanical ventilation
        *   HFNC with FiO2 > 0.5 and P/F ratio < 300
        *   Rebreathing mask with P/F ratio dependent on O2 flow (e.g. >10L the P/F < 300)
    *   At least one dose of antibiotics administered
*   **Exclusion**:
    *   Treated by vasopressors for septic shock at time of inclusion
    *   Clinical history suggesting aspiration
    *   Treated by invasive mechanical ventilation within last 14 days
    *   \> 7 days of antibiotics prior
    *   PCR +ve for influenza
    *   Use of > 15mg prednisolone (or equivalent) / day for > 30 days
    *   Pregnancy
    *   CF, active TB or fungal infection and active viral hepatitis or active infection with herpes virus
*   5948 screened with 800 randomised
    *   401 to receive hydrocortisone
    *   399 to receive placebo
*   Comparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group
    *   Balanced between groups
    *   Age: 67 vs 67
    *   Male: 70 vs 69%
    *   COPD: 22 vs 27%
    *   Diabetes: 24 vs 22%
    *   Mechanical Ventilation (IMV or NIV): 45 vs 44%
    *   HFNC: 42 vs 41%
    *   Nonrebreather mask: 13 vs 15%
    *   PSI Score IV: 38 vs 34%
    *   PSI Score V: 46 vs 49%
    *   Median CRP: 26 vs 24 mg/dL
    *   Median Cortisol: 302 vs 307 nmol/L

### Intervention

*   Hydrocortisone
    *   200mg/day for 4 days
    *   Treating team using predefined criteria decided whether to administer for a total of 8 or 14 days with a prespecified tapering plan
        *   8 days total if all of the following met on day 4: P/F > 200, breathing spontaneously and day 4 SOFA ≤ the SOFA score on day 1
    *   Median duration 5 days

### Control

*   Placebo
    *   Same protocol used
    *   Median duration 6 days

#### Management common to both groups

*   Treatment discontinued on ICU discharge
*   Other management (including choice of respiratory support) at discretion of treating teams but should follow standard therapy

### Outcome

*   **Primary outcome**:
    *   Death by day 28: Hydrocortisone 6.2% vs Placebo 11.9%
        *   Difference -5.6% (-9.6 to -1.7%), p = 0.006
*   **Secondary outcomes**:
*   Comparing hydrocortisone vs. placebo group
    *   No significant difference in
        *   Cumulative incidence of hospital acquired infection by day 28: 9.8 vs 11.1%
        *   Cumulative incidence of GI bleeding by day 28: 2.2 vs 3.3%
    *   Significantly greater in intervention group
        *   Median daily dose of insulin by day 7: 35.5 vs 20.0 IU/day
    *   Significantly less in intervention group
        *   Death by day 90: 9.3% vs 14.7%
        *   Cumulative incidence of endotracheal intubation by day 28: 18.0 vs 29.5%
        *   Cumulative incidence of endotracheal intubation by day 28 in those not receiving at baseline: 19.5% vs 27.7%
        *   Cumulative incidence of vasopressor initiation by day 28 in those not receiving at baseline: 15.3 vs 25.0%
*   **Selected Subgroups:**
*   Comparing hydrocortisone vs placebo, the following subgroups trended to favouring hydrocortisone use:
    *   Not mechanically ventilated: 6/222 vs 22/220
        *   Risk difference -7.3 (95% CI -12.6 to -2.0)
    *   No germ isolated: 11/189 vs 25/168
        *   Risk difference – 9.1 (95% CI -15.0 to -3.1)
    *   Age > 65: 19/222 vs 38/228
        *   Risk difference -8.1 (95% CI -13.3 to -2.9)
    *   Women: 4/119 vs 16/124
        *   Risk difference -9.5 (95% CI -16.7 to -2.3)

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   Early treatment with hydrocortisone reduced 28-day mortality in those admitted to the ICU with severe CAP

### Strengths

*   Multi-centre, double blind, placebo-controlled trial
*   Balanced baseline characteristics – especially with respect to other classically steroid responsive conditions such as COPD and asthma
*   Early initiation of hydrocortisone – initiated within ~20 hours from hospital admission
*   Minimal apparent selection bias – of the 5148 excluded, very few were for reasons other than the pre-defined exclusion criteria (n = 276 “medical team declined” and n = 79 “no reason provided”)
*   Minimal loss to follow up (2 patients)
*   The exclusion of septic shock sensible given potential benefits shown with the use of steroids in this patient cohort
*   Included patients who clearly had severe CAP with respect to ventilatory support required at randomisation and PSI score
*   High level of adherence to protocol with very few protocol violations
    *   Only 6% received open label steroids

### Weaknesses

*   Single country
*   Although 800 patients randomised there were lower mortality numbers than predicted
    *   Only 72 deaths across both arms with a fragility index 6 patients
*   Optimal steroid and steroid regimen (e.g. tapered or not) yet to be determined especially with differing pharmacological properties
    *   The benefit of dexamethasone shown in COVID-19 in the [RECOVERY trial](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/recovery-covid-19-dexamethasone/)
         and ARDS patients in [DEXA-ARDS](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/dexa-ards/)
         trial
*   Microbiological investigation not standardized
    *   ~45% no pathogen identified
    *   The subgroup in which no pathogens were isolated trended to favouring steroid use compared to those in whom a pathogen was isolated (Figure S3)

### The Bottom Line

*   Following this trial, I will now strongly consider the use of steroids in patients admitted with severe CAP
*   I await the publication of REMAP-CAP non pandemic corticosteroid domain, as a larger platform trial will hopefully further inform practice

Methylprednisolone Infusion in Early Severe ARDS
================================================

Meduri G et al. Chest 2007; 131:954–63.

### Clinical Question

*   In patients with early ARDS, does continuous methylprednisolone compared to placebo reduce lung injury scores within 7 days?

### Design

*   Randomised, controlled trial
*   2:1 block computer-generated randomisation
*   Double blinded until analysis

### Setting

*   Multi-centre study in Memphis, USA
*   April 1997 to April 2002

### Population

*   Inclusion: Adults that met ARDS diagnostic criteria (American-European Consensus definition)
*   Exclusion: Already on steroid therapy, or steroids contra-indicated, morbid obesity, burns, severe liver disease.
*   500 assessed of which 91 randomised

### Intervention

*   28 days of methylprednisolone in tapering dosage
    *   1mg/kg loading dose, followed by 1 mg/kg/day for 14 days, then 0.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days, 0.25 mg/kg/day for 4 days and finally 0.123 mg/kf/day for 3 days.
    *   Given as continuous intravenous infusion until able to take a single oral dose daily.

### Control

*   0.9% saline or oral placebo

### Outcome

*   Primary outcome: 1-point improvement in Lung Injury Score (LIS) was seen in 69% of those treated with methylprednisolone versus 35.7% of those who received placebo (p=0.002)
*   Secondary outcomes: Mean LIS scores 2.14+/-0.12 vs 2.68+/-0.14 (p=0.004) favouring methylprednisolone. Number of patients breathing without assistance 54% vs 25% (p=0.01)

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   Glucocorticoid treatment-induced down-regulation of systemic inflammation in ARDS is associated with a significant improvement in pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction and a reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay.

### Strengths

*   Double blinded
*   Intention-to-treat analysis with only 13% drop-out (which is less than between group difference in outcome)

### Weaknesses

*   Group sequential clinical trial will bias toward positive outcome
*   A baseline difference between groups existed regarding “catecholamine-dependent shock”, which was twice as high in the placebo group (p=0.03). This would favour a positive outcome with the intervention, due to poorer outcomes in the placebo group.
*   Open-label treatment with methylprednisolone for all non-responders at days 7–9 confuses the findings.
*   Underpowered to detect statistically significant difference in mortality, which may be more clinically relevant than lung injury scores.

### The Bottom Line

*   Patients with ARDS should not be given early methylprednisolone based on this study alone, due to methodological concerns.

CORTICUS: Hydrocortisone Therapy for Patients with Septic Shock
===============================================================

Sprung et al. N Engl J Med 2008; 358:111-24.

### Clinical Question

*   In adult patients with severe septic shock, does hydrocortisone versus placebo reduce mortality at 28 days?

### Design

*   Multi-centre, randomised controlled trial
*   Double-blinded
*   Computer generated, block randomisation stratified by study centre.
*   All patients had short corticotropin test to identify “responders” from “non-responders” for _a priori_ sub-group analysis.
*   Adverse events data collected for safety analysis at blinded interim intervals.
*   Power calculation: if 40% included were “non-responders” with a baseline 28-day mortality of 50%, then 400 patients per arm were required to detect 10% absolute reduction in mortality with 80% power and 5% accepted type 1 error.

### Setting

*   52 participating ICUs
*   March 2002 to November 2005

### Population

*   Inclusion: adults with severe sepsis, with all of the following:
    *   clinical evidence of infection;
    *   systemic response to inflammation;
    *   shock (systolic BP < 90 mmHg despite 1 hour fluid resuscitation or the need for vasopressors);
    *   organ dysfunction attributable to shock.
*   Exclusion: chronic steroids within 6 months; acute steroids within 4 weeks; immunosupression;  less than 24 survival expectation
*   499 patients recruited

### Intervention

*   Hydrocortisone given as 50 mg in 6-hourly boluses
    *   Tapering regime from day 6. Stopped on day 12.

### Control

*   Identical placebo prepared and administered in an identical way to intervention.

### Outcome

*   Primary outcome: no difference in 28-day mortality in short corticotropin non-responders (i.e. the sub-group that were more likely to benefit from exogenous corticosteroids)
    *   39.2% in hydrocortisone group vs. 36.1% in placebo group
    *   Absolute difference 3.1% (95% C.I. -9.5% to 15.7%) favouring placebo.
    *   p=0.69
*   Secondary outcome:
    *   No difference in 28-day mortality in short corticotropin responders (i.e. the sub-group that were less likely to benefit from exogenous corticosteroids)
        *   28.8% vs. 28.7%, P=1.0
    *   No difference in 28-day mortality in all patients
        *   34.3% vs. 31.5%, P=0.51
    *   Statistically significant reduction in the time to reversal of shock favouring the hydrocortisone group (seen in responders, non-responders and all patient groups).
        *   median time until reversal of shock, in all patients, was 3.3 days (95% C.I. 2.9-3.9) in the hydrocortisone group vs. 5.8 days (95% C.I. 5.2-6.9) in the placebo group
    *   Non-significant increase in rate of superinfections in hydrocortisone vs. placebo group
        *   33% vs. 26%, RR 1.27 (95% C.I. 0.96-1.68)

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   The use of hydrocortisone did not decrease mortality in a general population of patients with septic shock, even though the drug hastened reversal of shock

### Strengths

*   Excellent randomisation and blinding methodology
*   Sensible primary outcome, and useful secondard outcomes
*   Fair commentary of problems by authors in ‘Discussion’ section of paper

### Weaknesses

*   Despite 52 ICUs, this study failed to recruit required numbers (average of less than 10 patients per ICU over 3 years) despite common incidence of severe sepsis.
*   Actually mortality (~38%) was much lower than estimated mortality used for power calculation (50%)

### The Bottom Line

*   This study did not demonstrate survival benefit from administering hydrocortisone to adult patients with severe septic shock. It may lead to harm from superinfection. It does lead to reversal of shock quicker than placebo.
*   Based on this study alone, hydrocortisone should not be routinely given to adult patients with severe septic shock.
*   It may be worth considering when all else has failed.

Effect of Treatment With Low Doses of Hydrocortisone and Fludrocortisone on Mortality in Patients With Septic Shock
===================================================================================================================

Annane et al. JAMA 2002; 288:862-871. doi:10.1001/jama.288.7.862

### Clinical Question

*   In patients with septic shock and relative adrenal deficiency does low dose corticosteroids improve 28 day mortality?

### Design

*   Randomised controlled trial
*   Double blind
*   Parallel group
*   Block randomisation stratified by centre
*   Intention to treat analysis
*   Sample size of 270 patients required to detect a a 20% difference on the 28 day mortality rate between the 2 groups, assuming a mortality rate of 95% in the non responder placebo subgroup, and a frequency of non responders of 40% in the study population
    *   false positive rate of 5%
    *   false negative rate of 10%

### **Authors’ Conclusions**

*   Low dose hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone reduced the risk of death in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency without increasing adverse events

### **Strengths**

*   Randomised
*   Double blinded
*   Multi-centre
*   93% of patients treated with appropriate antibiotics, similar in both groups

### **Weaknesses**

*   Primary outcome was survival distribution. This is not particularly helpful as demonstrating that a patient survives for a few more days will not convince me that the treatment is beneficial. It would have much better if the primary outcome had been 28 day mortality.
*   The results for 28 day-mortality were only statistically significant when adjusted for baseline characteristics. When the raw data is used the results are no longer significant and this is despite the fact that the baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups.
*   24% of patients received etomidate that inhibits adrenal corticosteroid synthesis
*   Time to antibiotics was delayed, compared to current standards (mean 6hrs in placebo vs. 7.1hrs in steroid group)
*   Only 300 patients randomised from 1326 screened. This limits the external validity.

### **Differences Between Annane and Corticus Trials**

*   This study found that patients with septic shock, and relative adrenal deficiency, who were treated with low dose steroids had a significantly improved mortality. This is in contrast to the CORTICUS study which found no improvement in mortality. However, CORTICUS was only powered at 35% to detect a 20% relative reduction of death (ref: [Finfer editorial](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe0708098)
    )
*   CORTICUS reported a reduction in time to reversal of shock in all patients treated with steroids whereas this study only found this benefit in patients with relative adrenal deficiency.
*   This study included a sicker population than CORTICUS as evidenced by a higher SAPS II Score and mortality.

### **The Bottom Line**

*   The two biggest studies regarding the use of steroids for septic shock have found conflicting results. On the basis of these studies I will not use steroids as routine for patients with septic shock due to the potential side effects. However in patients that are not responding to treatment and are at high risk of death, I will continue to use steroids as some benefits have been reported. I will not base my decision on the corticotrophin result as other [studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16566699?dopt=Abstract)
     have reported a number of limitations with using this test in critically ill patients. I eagerly await the results of the ADRENAL study which will hopefully allow a more evidenced based decision to be made.

Effect of Prolonged Methylprednisolone Therapy in Unresolving Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
=================================================================================================

Meduri. JAMA 1998; 280(2):159-165

### Clinical Question

*   Does a prolonged course of intravenous methylprednisolone improve lung function and reduce mortality in patients with unresolving ARDS

### Design

*   Randomised and double-blinded
*   Randomised in blocks of 3 according to a random number generator and stratified by site

### Setting

*   4 Medical ICU’s in different hospitals in Memphis, US
*   October 1994 – November 1996

### Population

*   Inclusion:
    *   ARDS by criteria 1995  NEJM ref 2
    *   Received 7 days of mechanical ventilation with a \*Lung Injury Score (LIS) of 2.5 or greater and < 1 point reduction from day 1 of ARDS
    *   No evidence of untreated infection
    *   18 years or older
*   Exclusion:
    *   Participation in any other research trial
    *   ARDS > 3 weeks
    *   Extensive burns
    *   Life expectancy < 3 months
    *   Pregnancy
    *   Recent gastrointestinal bleed
    *   Presence of disease requiring more than 1mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone
*   16 patients received methylprednisolone and 8 received placebo
*   At study entry (day 9 \[SD 3\] of ARDS) both groups had similar LIS, PaO2/FiO2 ratio and MODS score 
    *   4 patients in each group had ARDS secondary to community acquired pneumonia
    *   Other causes included drug interactions (TCA overdose and anaphylaxis), aspiration and pulmonary blastomycosis

\*LIS = alveolar consolidation on CXR; PaO2/FiO2; PEEP; respiratory compliance if known

### Intervention

*   Methylprednisolone for 32 days
    *   Loading dose 2 mg/kg/day and then the same total daily dose for 14 days
    *   Methylprednisolone dose was tapered from day 15 to 32
    *   If the patient was extubated prior to day 14, treatment was advanced to day 15

### Control

*   Placebo

In both groups:

*   patients whose LIS failed to improve by at least 1 point after 10 days of treatment were blindly crossed over to the other treatment strategy
    *   0 patients from the methylprednisolone group were swapped to placebo
    *   4 (50%) patients from the placebo group were swapped to methylprednisolone (p=0.007)
*   ventilator management was designed to limit plateau pressure at 35cm or less of water
*   diagnostic bronchoscopy (unless contraindicated) with BAL was performed on day 5 of mechanical ventilation and then weekly whilst patient ventilated

### Outcome

*   Primary outcome:
    *   ICU mortality
        *   0 of 16 in intervention group vs. 5 of 8 patients in the control group (62%) p=0.002 NNT 2
    *   Improvement in LIS (>1 point) in intervention group compared with placebo group after 10 days of treatment
        *   100% vs. 25% NNT 2
        *   mean LIS (SEM) 1.7 (0.1) vs. 3.0 (0.2); p<0.001
*   Secondary outcomes favoured the intervention group
    *   Hospital mortality: 2 of 16 (13%) in intervention group vs. 5 of 8 patients in the control group (62%); p=0.03
    *   Death associated with unresolving ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 of 75 or less at the time of death): 0 of 2 patients vs. 5 of 5 (100%)
    *   PaO2/FiO2 ratio at study day 10: mean 262 vs. 148; p<0.001
    *   Successful extubation by day 10: 7 patients (44%) vs. 0 patients
    *   Mean MODS score at study day 10: 0.7 vs. 1.8; p=0.001
    *   MODS-free days at study day 28: 16 (2%) vs. 6 (2%); p=0.005
    *   Median duration of mechanical ventilation
        *   11.5 days vs. 23 days; p=0.001
    *   Survival at study day 10: 16 (100%) vs 6 (75%), p=0.1
*   Other outcomes
    *   Infections per 100 days of treatment was similar
    *   Ventilator associated pneumonia occurred more frequently in the intervention group but this did not reach statistical significance
    *   survival in patients treated with placebo throughout the study period vs. survival in patients treated with methylprednisolone at any time
        *   2 (50%) vs. 23 (82%), p=0.2

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   ‘In this study, prolonged administration of methylprednisolone in patients with unresolving ARDS was associated with improvement in lung injury and MODS score and reduced mortality’

### Strengths

*   Prolonged treatment course
*   Cross over provision for patients who did not respond to other treatment interventions
*   Careful protocol for identifying infection including regular bronchoscopy
*   Select patient group

### Weaknesses

*   Trial stopped early
*   Sicker patients in the placebo group although not statistically significant (LIS 3 vs. 3.3, p=0.16; MODS score 1.5 vs. 2.5, p-0.22)
*   Little explanation of methodology particularly with regards to ventilatory strategy
*   CT or other radiological data would have been useful
*   Instead of a traditional power analysis, the study used a sequential analysis of study results as data accumulated. This analysis led to an very small trial size of 24 patients  despite a long trial period. The original power calculation was for 99 patients to be recruited
*   With only 8 patients in the placebo group
    *   3 of 8 (> 1/3) had causes other than community acquired pneumonia for developing ARDS (1 pulmonary blastocytosis; 1 anaphylactic reaction to urokinase; 1 chemical aspiration).
    *   only 4 patients were treated with placebo throughout the study period as the other 4 patients were swapped to the intervention group at day 10

### The Bottom Line

*   The use of methylprednisolone in ARDS is controversial. We know that its early use is associated with harm. This study looking at its use from day 7 after diagnosing ARDS was underpowered and included heterogenous causes for the development of ARDS. With improvements in lung protective strategies and overall mortality for ARDS on the decline, the role of steroids is perhaps less relevant. The difficulty is predicting the patient group that end up with established fibrotic lung disease where steroid therapy in theory may have helped. Radiological surveillance, respiratory specialist input and confirming no evidence of infection is essential before considering its use. A RCT which is powered to detect an improvement in one year mortality and lung function is required.

Effect of intravenous corticosteroids on death within 14 days in 10 008 adults with clinically significant head injury: randomised placebo-controlled trial
===========================================================================================================================================================

Roberts et al for the CRASH trial collaborators. Lancet 2004; 364:1321-28. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17188-2

### Clinical Question

*   In adults with a head injury, do early corticosteroids compared to placebo reduce death and disability?

### Design

*   Randomised, controlled trial
*   Centralised (21%) and non-centralised (79%) randomised concealed allocation method
*   Blinding of clinicians, patients, and data analysts
*   Annual interim analyses, with unmasking only if:
    *   “proof beyond reasonable doubt of a difference” was found or,
    *   new published data removed equipoise and uncertainty regarding corticosteroid use
*   Intention-to-treat analysis
*   Powered at 90% to detect 2% difference in mortality from baseline of 15%, with accepted type I error of 0.01 (chance of false positive), if 20,000 patients were recruited

### Setting

*   239 hospitals from 49 countries
    *   Europe 38%, Asia 27%, South America 16%, Africa 14%, North America 4%, Oceania 1%
*   April 1999 to May 2004

### Population

*   Inclusion: adults over 16 years with head injuries, who presented within 8 hours of injury with GCS ≤ 14
*   Exclusion: clear indication or contraindication for steroids
*   10,008 patients randomised

### Intervention

*   Administration of methylprednisolone for 48 hours
    *   Loading dose of 2 g over 1 hour in 100 ml 0.9% NaCl
    *   Maintenance of 0.4 g per hour for 48 hours in 20 ml per hour 0.9% NaCl

### Control

*   Identical regime of placebo

### Outcome

*   Primary outcome: unmasking of randomisation took place after 10,008 patients due to a clear difference favouring placebo for mortality at 2-weeks
    *   Corticosteroid group 21% mortality vs placebo group 18% mortality
    *   Relative risk 1.18 (95% CI 1.09–1.27; p=0.0001)
    *   Absolute risk increase 3.15% (95% CI 1.60%–4.70%; NNH 32)
*   Secondary outcome: 6-month follow-up favoured placebo for mortality and severe disability

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |Secondary Outcomes
| Measure | Corticosteroids | Placebo | RR  | ARR | NNH |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6-month mortality | 1248 (25.7%) | 1075 (22.3%) | 1.15  <br>(95% CI 1.07–1.24; p=0.0001) | \-3.40%  <br>(95% CI 1.70%–5.10%) | 29  |
| 6-month mortality or severe disability | 1828 (38.1%) | 1728 (36.3%) | 1.05  <br>(95% CI 0.99–1.10; p=0.079) | \-1.80%  <br>(95% CI -0.12%–3.72%) | 55  |

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   “Corticosteroids should not be used routinely to treat head injury, whatever the severity.”

### Strengths

*   Excellent external validity due to worldwide recruitment and minimal exclusion criteria
*   Robust statistical thresholds in planning phase (⍺<0.01, β=90%)
*   Primary outcome data available for over 99% of patients
*   Rapid publication of important outcome with secondary outcomes published later

### Weaknesses

*   Halting at interim stage may produce results that are due to an extreme play of chance
*   Hyperglycaemia from corticosteroid administration may have unblinded clinicians and / or led to unbalanced management of the two groups (see Lancet comments)
*   Cause of death not investigated, so further theories and an explanation for the results are limited

### The Bottom Line

*   Corticosteroids should not be given to patients with head injuries, unless other specific indications exist that outweigh the increased risk of death demonstrated by this trial

Torres: Effect of Corticosteroids on Treatment Failure Among Hospitalized Patients with Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia and High Inflammatory Response
==========================================================================================================================================================

Torres. JAMA 2015; 313(7):677-687. doi:10.1001/jama.2015.88

### Clinical Question

*   June 2004 – February 2012

### Population

*   Inclusion
    *   Age > 18
    *   Clinical symptoms suggestive of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
    *   New chest radiographic infiltrates
    *   Severe CAP as defined by either/or
        *   Modified American Thoracic Society criteria for severe CAP
        *   Pneumonia Severity Index risk class 4
    *   C-reactive Protein (CRP) > 150mg/L

| Table defining primary outcome |

*   Primary outcome: less overall (early + late) treatment failure occurred in the methylprednisolone group
    *   This was predominantly due to a difference in late treatment failures, and specifically the occurrence of increased pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs
*   Secondary outcomes: there were no significant differences in the duration until stability, length of stay or mortality

| Table of results |

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   Among patients with severe CAP and high initial inflammatory response, the acute use of methylprednisolone compared to placebo decreased treatment failure.

### Strengths

*   Randomised, blinded, multi-centre
*   Patients, investigators and data assessors were blinded
    *   It’s likely bedside clinicians were blinded too, although not explicitly stated
*   Targeted severe CAP as defined by recognised definitions
*   Adequate power calculation and observed baseline rate in control group approximated that assumed for the power calculation

### Weaknesses

*   Long trial duration
    *   Other practices may have changed during the trial
    *   Authors compared first 3 years against last 4 years and found no differences
    *   Unlikely to affect internal validity but generalisability may be reduced
*   Treatment discontinued in 10% of patients in intervention group
*   Choice and duration of antibiotics not specified
*   Unusual composite primary outcome makes it difficult to clinically apply
    *   Authors argue that ‘treatment failure’ is a surrogate for resource use and patient mortality
*   Fragility index = 2 (see further reading link below)
    *   If 2 additional patients of the 61 in the intervention group had been ‘treatment failures’ then the result would have been non-significant (p > 0.05) and the conclusion may have been drawn differently

### The Bottom Line

*   This study raises an interesting question, and the methodology to answer this is reasonable. However, the small numbers and composite, surrogate primary outcome limit the generalisability.
*   The authors are conducting a larger trial to investigate this further
*   Clinical practice should not be changed based upon this trial alone

Effect of Early Vasopressin vs Norepinephrine on Kidney Failure in Patients With Septic Shock  
The VANISH Randomized Clinical Trial
====================================================================================================================================

[Gordon. JAMA. 2016;316(5):509-518. doi:10.1001/jama.2016.10485](https://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2540403)

### Clinical Question

*   Does early vasopressin use reduce the risk of kidney failure in patients with septic shock compared with norepinephrine?

### Design

*   Factorial (2×2) multicenter, double blind, randomised controlled trial
*   Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups on a 1:1:1:1 basis with variable block size randomisation (4 and 8) using computer-generated numbers, stratified by center
*   Intention to treat analysis
*   A sample size of 400 provided 80% power to detect a 20% to 25% relative reduction of risk of developing kidney failure if treated with vasopressin compared with norepinephrine, assuming an overall incidence of acute kidney failure of 30-50% and a significance level of 0.05

### Setting

*   18 adult general ICU’s
*   February 2013 – May 2015

### Population

*   Inclusion: Adult patients (≥16 years) who had sepsis (2 of 4 systemic inflammatory response criteria due to known or suspected infection) and who required vasopressors despite adequate intravenous fluid resuscitation. Enrollment into the trial within 6 hours
*   Exclusion: patients who had received a previous continuous infusion of vasopressors during this ICU admission; requirement for systemic steroid treatment (e.g adrenal insufficiency or regular systemic steroid therapy within the last 3 months); end-stage kidney failure; known mesenteric ischaemia; Raynaud phenomenon; systemic sclerosis; other vasospastic disease; known pregnancy
*   421 patients were randomised of which 409 patients were included in the study

### Intervention

*   Open labelled vasopressor was permitted for up to 6 hours before enrolment to this study. Once study drug one was commenced, the open labelled vasopressor was weaned off as quickly as possible

**Study drug 1**

*   Vasopressin (titrated up to 0.06 U/min) or Norepinephrine (titrated up to 12 μg/min)
    *   administered via a central venous catheter
    *   titrated to maintain the target mean arterial pressure 65 to 75 mm Hg, but this could be altered by the treating physician

**Study drug 2**

*   Hydrocortisone (50mg 6 hourly and then weaned) or Placebo
    *   study drug 2 was administered once the maximum infusion rate of study drug 1 was reached
    *   administered as an intravenous bolus every 6 hours for 5 days, every 12 hours for 3 days, and then once daily for 3 days
    *   study drug 2 could be weaned more quickly if the shock had already resolved

**In all groups**

*   If the patient was still hypotensive after the first dose of study drug 2 then additional open-label catecholamine vasopressors could be administered
*   Open-label catecholamine vasopressors were reduced first and only once the patient was weaned off open-label vasopressors was study drug 1 then reduced

### Outcome

*   Primary outcome: the number of days alive and free of kidney failure (defined by [AKIN group stage 3](https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/cc5713)
    ) separated into two outcome measures:
    *   28 day survivors who never developed kidney failure: no difference between groups
        *   vasopressin + hydrocortisone: 56.8%
        *   vasopressin + placebo: 57.1%
        *   Norepinephrine + hydrocortisone: 59.7%
        *   Norepinephrine + placebo: 59.2%
        *   Vasopressin vs. Norepinephrine absolute difference: -2.3 \[95% CI -13.0 to 8.5\]
    *   median number of days alive and free of kidney failure for those patients that did not survive and/or who experienced kidney failure
        *   vasopressin + hydrocortisone: 5 days (IQR 0-23)
        *   vasopressin + placebo: 12 days (IQR 1-25)
        *   Norepinephrine + hydrocortisone: 13 days (IQR 0-25)
        *   Norepinephrine + placebo: 14 days (IQR 1-24)
        *   Vasopressin vs. Norepinephrine absolute Difference: −4 days \[95% CI −11 to 5\]

[![VANISH2](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/VANISH2.png)](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/VANISH2.png)

*   Secondary outcomes: Fewer patients required renal replacement therapy in the vasopressin group compared with the norepinephrine group. These patients were mostly the non-survivors
*   Other secondary outcomes: no significant difference between groups for:
    *   28 day, ICU or hospital mortality rates
    *   Kidney failure rate
    *   Use of inotropes and shock reversal
    *   Mean SOFA scores
    *   Duration of mechanical ventilation
    *   ICU and hospital length of stay
    *   Serious adverse events (including digital or mesenteric ischaemia, life-threatening arrhythmia and acute coronary syndrome)
        *   10.7% in the vasopressin group vs 8.3% in the norepinephrine group; difference, 2.5% \[95% CI, −3.3% to 8.2%\]

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   Among adults with septic shock,the early use of vasopressin compared with norepinephrine did not improve the number of kidney failure–free days

### Strengths

*   An important clinical question comparing vasoactive drugs and the interaction of corticosteroids in patients with septic shock
*   Drug ampoules were masked by overlabeling on the body and neck of normal drug ampoules. Matching placebo ampoules were used
*   All clinical staff and researchers were blinded
*   The baseline characteristics of the groups were well matched for APACHE II score, co-morbidities (including risk of renal injury such as pre-exisiting chronic kidney disease and diabetes), median fluid volume received in the first 4 hours and infection source (primarily lung)

### Weaknesses

*   Timing of initiation of renal replacement therapy and levels of haemodynamic monitoring were not controlled, other than specifying that sites should follow the international guidelines
*   Short time outcomes (28 day and hospital mortality) were assessed and therefore any long-term differences between treatment groups cannot be assessed
*   No health economic analysis – the lower rate of renal replacement therapy in the vasopressin-treated patients could be important
*   72% of patients received study drug 2. Only 35% of patients received steroid treatment. The power to assess an interaction between steroids and vasopressors, particularly vasopressin is therefore limited

### The Bottom Line

*   Early vasopressin maintains blood pressure and reduces the requirement for norepinephrine and renal replacement therapy. However, vasopressin does not reduce the number of renal replacement free days or mortality rate, and there was no clinical interaction with corticosteroids

Effect of Hydrocortisone on Development of Shock Among Patients With Severe Sepsis
==================================================================================

Keh. JAMA 2016. Published online October 3, 2016.doi:10.1001/jama.2016.14799

### Clinical Question

*   In patients with severe sepsis does hydrocortisone compared to placebo prevent the development of septic shock?

### Design

*   Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial
*   Internet-based randomisation stratified by participating centre and sex
*   The randomization used the Pocock minimization algorithm to ensure balanced 1:1 randomization in the strata at any time
*   All patients, study personnel, staff were blinded for the entire study
*   Intention to treat (and per protocol) analysis
*   Assuming 40% of the patients in the placebo group would develop septic shock, to detect a 15% difference with the intervention arm (p<0.05, power of 80%), 169 patients per arm were required. Accounting for a drop out of ~10%, 190 patients per arm (380 total) were included.

### Setting

*   34 study sites in Germany
*   January 13 2009 to August 27 2013

### Population

*   Inclusion:
    *   Evidence of infection (1 of: micro-organism identified in normally sterile body fluid, identified focus of infection, granulocytes in sterile body fluid, clinically suspected infection without microbiological evidence)
    *   Evidence of SIRS (2 of: fever >38°C or hypothermia <36°C, tachycardia >90bpm, tachypnea >20/min or CO2<33mmHg or mechanically ventilated, leukocytosis >12000/ul or leucopenia <4000/ul or >10% immature forms)
    *   Evidence of Organ Dysfunction for not longer than 48 hours (1 of: encephalopathy, AKI, coagulopathy, pulmonary dysfunction, microcirculatory dysfunction)
    *   Informed consent possible from patient or NOK
*   Exclusion:
    *   Patients with septic shock, ie patients who are hypotensive despite adequate fluid resuscitation (MAP<65Hg, SBP<90mmHg) or those needing vasopressors for more than 4 hours. Transient use of vasopressors ok whilst fluid resuscitation occurs.
    *   Patients with hypersensitivity to the hydrocortisone or placebo (mannitol)
    *   Patients regularly on glucocorticoids
    *   Patients with a condition indicating glucocorticoid therapy
    *   DNR or moribund patients
    *   <18 years
    *   Recent trial participation (30 days)
    *   Pregnant/Breast-feeding
    *   Related to study personnel
*   Patients were NOT EXCLUDED for using etomidate or a short course of glucocorticoids within 72 hours before enrollment OR using topical or inhaled glucocorticoids
*   9953 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock were screened and 380 randomized to receive hydrocortisone n=190 or placebo n=190

### Intervention

*   Bolus of hydrocortisone iv 50mg followed by a 24 hour continuous infusion of 200mg for 5 days, 100mg for Day 6 & 7, 50mg on Day 8 & 9 and 25mg on Day 10 & 11
    *   The continuous infusion was preferred to prevent unwanted undulation in blood glucose concentrations

### Control

*   The placebo was lyophilized mannitol which was indistinguishable from the hydrocortisone (133mg mannitol – a tiny dose compared with therapeutic mannitol for raised ICP = 1g/kg)

### Outcome

*   Primary outcome: the occurrence of septic shock within 14 days, which was assessed daily until day 14 or discharge from ICU
    *   The intention to treat analysis excluded 27 patients – consent issues, septic shock at inclusion, or did not receive study medication
    *   **In the ITT population: shock occurred in 36/170 (21.2%) patients in the hydrocortisone group vs 39/170 (22.9%) patients in the placebo group (p=0.70, Difference= -1.8% 95% CI -10.7% to 7.2%)**
    *   In the per-protocol analysis there was no difference in development of septic shock
    *   Subgroup analysis: medical vs surgical patients, pneumonia, those receiving study medication for> 48hrs did not reveal any benefit for shock prevention
*   Secondary outcome: No differences between groups:
    
    *   Time until development of septic shock or death
    *   Mortality in ICU and hospital
    *   Vital status at Day 28, 90 & 180
    *   Duration of ICU and hospital stay
    *   SOFA score
    *   Duration of mechanical ventilation
    *   RRT
    
    *   In 206 patients, baseline cortisol concentration was checked and the level rechecked following administration of 250ug corticotropin. The primary and secondary outcomes in this subgroup were evaluated – 33.5% of these patients had CIRCI (Critical Illness Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency). No difference in primary or secondary endpoints between patients with or without CIRCI
    *   Adverse events assessed included muscle strength scores, secondary infection, hyperglycaemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, delirium and weaning failure. There were more episodes of hyperglycaemia in the hydrocortisone group but the total amount of insulin delivered was not significantly different. Delirium was **less** common in the hydrocortisone group (placebo group 24.5% vs hydrocortisone group 11.2%, p=0.01). The other adverse events did not differ between groups.

![tbl-hypress-data-table](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/tbl-hypress-data-table-1.png)

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   Administration of hydrocortisone did not prevent the development of shock in patients with severe sepsis.

### Strengths

*   An important question: the use of steroids in sepsis and septic shock is one of the longest running debates in critical care. This trial uniquely examines the use of steroids to prevent shock in patients with established sepsis.
*   Allocation concealment
*   Blinding
*   Intention to treat analysis
*   <5% lost to follow-up

### Weaknesses

*   Patients who developed septic shock early may have been missed because informed consent was necessary before randomisation
*   The mortality rate in this trial was relatively low (8.5% at Day 28) so this was a relatively well cohort compared to other sepsis trials (reflecting the haemodynamic stability of the patients at the time of randomization)
*   Not all patients had baseline adrenal function assessed. Only certain sites did this test and it needed to be done before randomization occurred.
*   Etomidate was used in 6.3% (placebo group) and 6.8% (hydrocortisone group) of patients pre-randomization. Etomidate selectively inhibits adrenal corticosteroid synthesis which may impact the overall result
*   Patients in the placebo arm were more likely to have received glucocorticoids pre-randomization and at higher doses (3.4% vs 1.7%, 600mg vs 200mg), but the number of patients involved was small.

### The Bottom Line

*   As a non-believer in the use of steroids in sepsis and septic shock I will continue my current practice of not using steroids in this setting.
*   I am working at a hospital actively recruiting for the ADRENAL trial. 3800 patients with septic shock are being recruited in a placebo-controlled trial to assess 90 day mortality. I keenly await these results which may put this question to rest forever!

    Do you have any idea why the trial used mannitol as it’s placebo? Isn’t mannitol an osmotic diuretic that would hypothetically lower blood pressure further??

        Jenny,  
        Thank you for your comment. It’s a good question. I’m guessing that lyophilised mannitol has a similar consistency and colour to the drug, to make it indistinguishable. The dosage, as Celia noted, is tiny compared to a therapeutic mannitol dose (less than 1%), so I don’t think it can lead to lower blood pressure. Trials are so carefully considered when being designed, so I doubt the authors would have done this if they weren’t sure. That’s not a particularly critical or scientific answer from me though!

Hydrocortisone, Vitamin C and Thiamine for the Treatment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock: A Retrospective Before-After Study
==============================================================================================================================

Marik. CHEST 2016; published on line first Dec 2016 doi:10.1016/j.chest.2016.11.036

### Clinical Question

*   Does intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine in addition to standard treatment, improve mortality in ICU patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, compared with standard treatment alone?

### Design

*   Retrospective observational study
*   Single centred

### Setting

*   Single centre in US
*   January – July 2016

### Population

*   Inclusion: patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and a procalcitonin (PCT) >2 ng/ml
*   Exclusion: patients aged < 18 years; pregnancy; patients with limitations of care
*   47 patients
*   Baseline characteristics (demographics, diagnosis, co-morbidities, positive blood cultures and interventions) were similar in both groups

### Intervention

*   Vitamin C + Hydrocortisone + Thiamine in addition to standard treatment
    *   1.5g QDS Vitamin C intravenously for 4 days or until ICU discharge
    *   Hydrocortisone 50mg QDS intravenously for 7 days or until ICU discharge followed by a taper over 3 days
    *    200mg thiamine BD for 4 days or until ICU discharge

### Control

*   Standard treatment

#### Both groups

*   received empirical broad spectrum antibiotics which were then deescalated according to microbiological data and clinical progress
*   managed by a conservative physiologic based fluid and vasopressor strategy
    *   24 hour fluid balance: 2.1 +/- 3.2L in the treatment group and 1.9 +/-2.7 in the control group
    *   72 hour fluid balance: 1.9 +/- 3.7L in the treatment group and 1.6 +/-3.3 in the control group
*   ventilated with a lung protective strategy avoiding hyperoxia
*   received limited use of sedative agents (dexmedetomidine preferred agent)
*   Norepinephrine was the vasopressor of first choice and titrated to a dose of 20 mcg/min targeting a mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg. Vasopressin (0.04 units/min) was added  followed by phenylephrine or epinephrine if the target MAP was not achieved
*   enteral nutrition was commenced 24 hours after ICU admission and once clinical stability was achieved
*   deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis with both enoxaparin (or heparin in patients with a calculated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and sequential compression
*   permissive hyperglycaemia was allowed
*   Routine stress ulcer prophylaxis was not administered

### Outcome

*   Primary outcome: Hospital mortality
    *   8.5% (4 of 47) in the treatment group compared to 40.4% (19 of 47) in the control group (p < 0.001)

*   Secondary outcome:
    *   mean duration of vasopressor therapy: 18.3 ± 9.8 hours after starting treatment with vitamin C protocol vs 54.9 ± 28.4 hours in the control group P<0.001
    *   requirement for renal replacement therapy in patients with AKI: 3 patients (10%) in the treatment group vs 11 (37%) in the control group P=0.02
    *   median ICU length of stay: 4 days in both groups
    *   PCT clearance (initial PCT minus PCT at 72 hours divided by the initial PCT multiplied by 100): 86.4% in the treatment group vs 33.9% in the control group
    *   The 72-hour delta SOFA score (difference between subsequent scores) was 4.8 ± 2.4 in the treatment group compared to 0.9 ± 2.7 in the control group (p<0.001).

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   The early use of intravenous vitamin C, together with corticosteroids and thiamine may prove to be effective in preventing progressive organ dysfunction including acute kidney injury and reducing the mortality of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Additional studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings

### Strengths

*   An interesting hypothesis generating study which has some biologically plausible explanations for benefit in sepsis
*   Vitamin C and thiamine are cheap and relatively safe. However, vitamin C toxicity can cause renal failure and the safety profile would be best evaluated in the context of an RCT

### Weaknesses

*   Not an RCT
*   Small numbers
*   Single centre
*   Multiple interventions and therefore not possible to determine which, if any, are associated with improved outcome
*   The treatment and control periods were not concurrent and occurred during different seasons
*   60% of patients in the control group were treated with corticosteroids
*   Details are provided for the underlying reason for death (including advanced dementia, severe heart failure, advanced sarcoidosis and severe COPD) but not for the control group

### The Bottom Line

*   This study is hypothesis generating. An RCT is required to determine the efficacy of vitamin C, steroids and thiamine in severe sepsis and septic shock. The results of ADRENAL will help guide future use of corticosteroids. I will not consider using vitamin C or thiamine in sepsis until additional studies, demonstrating benefit, are completed. Until then, I will eagerly wait to see if the combination of vitamin C, steroids and thiamine offers a ‘Marikle’ cure for sepsis

    Hi Steve,
    
    Great summary as usual. There is a storming debate over on EMCrit/PulmCrit following Josh Farkas’ in-depth review of the same paper that is worth heading over to for a read.
    
    I accept all of the pro and con criticisms that have been laid out, yet I come to a different practice decision. I agree that a small, before-and-after, single centre trial of itself should be no more than hypothesis generating. However, Paul’s trial builds upon pre-existing work. I want to see the RCT and we might look at doing something here in Wollongong (likely to be no more than a single centre though), however, here’s the thing; we still need to make the best decisions that we can based on the current best information available.
    
    We’ve been suckered before with ‘magic bullets’ that then appear to fail at MC-RCT level, including steroids. And many have significant ADR profiles. Vitamin C may ultimately fail the ‘gold standard’ trial but in the meantime there is a negligible ADR profile associated with it. Critics will (and have) brought up the usual spectres of Hawthorne effect, small sample sizes and dissecting the effects of packaged therapies (Marik’s Marikle compound consists of Vit C + Thiamine + Steroid), yet how many patients are currently in ICUs already receiving thiamine and steroids? Why not start with an RCT on that cohort? And while that is getting coordinated, for the centres that do not get involved in that RCT, think about setting up a registry? This is ultimately not much different from post marketing surveillance that occurs for drugs and devices that get FDA/TGA/etc approval.
    
    Here’s the argument put forward by an intensivist (Tim Baptist) on the PulmCrit site:
    
    Universe 1: Cocktail works  
    – Early adopters: Saved lives  
    – Skeptics: Lost lives that could have been saved  
    Universe 2: Cocktail doesn’t work  
    – Early adopters; No lives saved; No to minimal harm done.  
    – Skeptics; No lives saved. No harm done.
    
    It has also been put forward that perhaps ADRENAL will be a negative trial if the Vit C component turns out to be true and if that is not examined, we might throw away a helpful therapy.
    
    Fascinating topic ultimately – as much for the debate as the itherapy itself. And if it does prove successful, let’s hope that your coined term “Marikle therapy” gets adopted.
    
    Thanks

    Thanks Matt
    
    It’s been a fascinating study and debate.
    
    I have a few issues with the study (others highlighted in the post):
    
    1) The mortality in the control group is very high. Rivers was only 6% higher 15 years ago. The EGDT studies had a 60 or 90 day mortality of 18.8% (ARISE); 18.2% (ProCESS) and 29.2% (ProMISE). It’s not clear why the control mortality is so high but this will exaggerate any difference in the experimental group
    
    2) The manuscript provides details of the 4 patients that died during their hospital stay, reporting that their death was not attributed to complications from sepsis. What about the control group?
    
    3) The belief that this therapy is harmless may be influencing opinions on whether an RCT with adverse event reporting is required. Whilst I accept that it probably does have limited side effects, we simply do not know (who would have thought that oxygen could be harmful?) Most studies (accepting Zabet and Fowler are important exceptions) have used the oral route for vitamin C and interactions with other drugs, treatments and pathologies may ultimately prove harmful. We also know from several previous studies that steroids might increase the risk of secondary infections. ADRENAL will be helpful to inform us of this
    
    4) No information is provided about timing and method of any procedural or surgical source control
    
    My view is an RCT is required to make sure we have conducted a robust study, that is powered to report important patient outcome measures. I feel uncomfortable that we may adopt a treatment based on a single centred before and after trial with such small numbers and high risk of bias. Equally, I understand why some will wish to adopt it immediately. The risk is that we may well end up with a treatment that has no effect but (possibly) no harm right now. Moreover, in the future, we may end up with this treatment ingrained in medical practice, and it does cause harm by drug interactions, toxicity or reducing the efficacy of new drug therapies.
    
    A prospective multi-centre cohort study may be the answer Matt. An RCT is clearly preferred but we all know it will take a long time.
    
    Thanks for taking the time to post
    
    Best wishes
    
    Steve

    \-10 points for a horrible title. The reason why there is so much skepticism about vitamin C in general, including intravenous vitamin C, is because people think of it as a mere nutrient. Intravenous vitamin C, which increases blood ascorbates way beyond oral administration, compared to oral vitamin C (regardless how much consumed, be it from an orange or supplement) is like comparing a glass of fine wine to a grape somebody stepped on. They’re not even in the same realm. It’s the difference between therapy and nutrition.

        Thanks for your comments David
        
        The title was deliberately meant to catch readers attention, although I accept your comments. I completely agree about your point relating to absorption and most definitely do not see intravenous Vitamin C as a mere nutrient. I still stand by my closing statement though – do the RCT and demonstrate the efficacy of Hydrocortisone, Vitamin C and Thiamine in severe sepsis and septic shock.

Corticosteroid Treatment and Intensive Insulin Therapy for Septic Shock in Adults
=================================================================================

Annane. JAMA 2010; 303(4): 341-348. doi:10.1001/jama.2010.2

### Clinical Question

*   In patients with septic shock who are treated with corticosteroids, does tight glycaemic control (4.44–6.1 mmol/l) compared with less-tight glycaemic control (<8.3 mmol/l) reduce in-hospital mortality?

### Background

*   Septic shock is a characterised by a dysregulated host response to an infection including hypotension that is not corrected by fluid administration alone
*   The administration of corticosteroids (hydrocortisone in particular) is thought to attenuate this response and evidence suggests that it reduces the degree of hypotension although it may not ultimately prevent death
*   A consequence of corticosteroid administration is dysregulation of glucose control, which may be harmful
*   It is possible that intensive insulin therapy, with the aim of tight serum glucose control within normal physiological parameters, may counteract some of the harm from corticosteroids allowing them to be more beneficial in patients with septic shock
*   This trial also investigated the effect of additional fludrocortisone as a secondary outcome as the interaction between glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids had not been adequately studied in patients with septic shock

### Design

*   Randomised, controlled trial
*   Multicentre
*   2×2 factorial design generating 4 groups of patients
    *   Arm 1: intensive insulin therapy vs conventional glucose control
    *   Arm 2: fludrocortisone vs no-fludrocortisone
*   Open-label
    *   Patients, clinical staff and research staff were aware of allocation
    *   No attempt to blind participants or staff
    *   No placebo therapy was used
*   Centralised web-based randomisation process with permutation blocks of variable size to conceal allocation prior to recruitment and randomisation
*   Hydrocortisone and other non-study therapies were standardised and controlled in keeping with 2004 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidance
*   Intention to treat analysis
*   Power calculation based only on Arm 1: intensive insulin therapy vs conventional glucose control
    *   Estimated 50% in-hospital mortality in control group
    *   Expected absolute reduction of 12.5% (25% relative reduction in mortality)
        *   This can be compared to the 32% relative reduction found in [Van den Berghe’s intensive insulin trial](http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa011300)
            )
    *   Statistics based upon α = 0.05 and Power (1-β) = 80%

### Setting

*   11 Intensive Care Units across France
*   January 2006 to January 2009

### Population

*   **Inclusion**:
    *   Adults who met the criteria ([ACCP/SCCM 1992](http://dx.doi.org/10.1378/chest.101.6.1644)
        ) for severe sepsis
    *   [SOFA score](https://lifeinthefastlane.com/ccc/apache-versus-sofa-scoring-systems/)
         ≥ 8
    *   Requirement for vasopressors / inotropes to maintain systolic BP > 90 mmHg or mean BP > 60 mmHg
    *   Receiving hydrocortisone 50mg IV every 6 hours
*   **Exclusion**: pregnancy; moribund patients expected to die imminently
*   946 patients screened; 509 were included and all were included in primary outcome analysis; 25 were lost to follow-up after hospital discharge (i.e. lost for some secondary outcomes)
*   Groups were well balanced for measured baseline variables

| Variable | Arm 1: Intensive | Arm 1: Conventional | Arm 2: With Fludrocortisone | Arm 2: Without Fludrocortisone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Age | 64 years | 64 years | 64 years | 64 years |
| SOFA score | 10.4 | 10.8 | 10.6 | 10.1 |
| Type of admission | 88.5% medical | 85.9% medical | 89.9% medical | 84.9% medical |
| Blood glucose at recruitment | 12.0 mmol/l | 11.3 mmol/l | 11.8 mmol/l | 11.5 mmol/l |
| Table of baseline characteristics |     |     |     |     |

### Intervention

*   **Arm 1**: Intensive Insulin Therapy
    *   Adapted from the [Van den Berghe trial](http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa011300)
        
    *   Insulin was initiated when blood glucose > 6.1 mmol/l (110 mg/dl)
    *   Commenced at 2 units/hr
    *   Blood glucose levels were checked at least hourly for first 3 hours and less frequently thereafter if stable
    *   Target range was 4.44–6.1 mmol/l (80–110 mg/dl)
    *   Hypoglycaemia (< 4.44 mmol/l \[80 mg/dl\] ) was treated with 10g glucose
    *   Insulin infusions were stopped on discharge from Intensive Care unless the patient presented with insulin dependence
*   **Arm 2**: Addition of fludrocortisone
    *   Hydrocortisone was continued
    *   9-α-fludrocortisone 50 µg was administered via nasogastric tube each morning at 8 am for 7 days

### Control

*   **Arm 1**: Conventional glucose control
    *   Physicians were advised to follow the [2004 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15090974)
         and not to follow the Intensive Insulin Therapy trial protocol
        *   “maintenance of blood glucose <150 mg/dL \[8.3 mmol/l\] after initial stabilization”
    *   Treatment dose and route of insulin was at the treating physician’s discretion
*   **Arm 2**: No addition of fludrocortisone
    *   Hydrocortisone was continued
    *   Fludrocortisone was not administered
    *   No placebo was administered either

#### Management common to both groups

*   Physicians were advised to follow the 2004 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for all non-trial therapies
*   Hydrocortisone was administered as 50 mg intravenously every 6 hours to all patients for 7 days from recruitment

### Outcome

*   Good separation between groups was achieved, with statistically significant lower blood glucose observed in the intervention group compared to the control group

*   **Primary outcome**: There was no statistically significant difference in the in-hospital mortality between the Intensive Insulin Therapy and the Conventional Glucose Control

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   This trial provides no evidence to support intensive insulin therapy (blood glucose target 80 to 110 mg/dl \[4.44 to 6.1 mmol/l\] ) for patients with septic shock being treated with corticosteroids

### Strengths

*   The hypothesis is reasonable given the described theory (but note comment in Weaknesses below), and the randomised, controlled trial design is arguably the best method to investigate this hypothesis
*   The multi-centre design increases external generalisation
*   The centralised, web-based randomisation process is the gold standard for concealing group allocation and preventing allocation bias
*   The power calculation was based on previous data, although in retrospect it was over optimistic to expect the intervention to reduce mortality by 25%
*   The statistical methods and intention-to-treat analysis plan were appropriate for the data types
*   Attempts were made to standardise non-study care according to published guidelines, which may reduce any ascertainment bias due to the lack of blinding, although the compliance with this was not reported
*   Good separation was demonstrated between the groups with regards to blood glucose levels, increasing the internal validity of the results
*   The primary outcome is objective and binary, reducing observer bias and simplifying assessment and analysis
*   The small confidence intervals around the null-effect point suggest that a true benefit or harm is unlikely, which strengthens the conclusion of this trial

### Weaknesses

*   The hypothesis tested tight glucose control with a target of 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/l against less-tight glucose control with a target of < 8.3 mmol/l, which are arguably not that dissimilar and perhaps the theory has not been adequately tested with this trial
    *   Compare this with [NICE-SUGAR](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/nice-sugar/)
        ‘s relaxed glucose control with a target of 8.0 to 10.0 mmol/l
*   The open-label design may introduce significant biases as clinical staff may unconsciously treat the patients differently depending upon their group allocation, which usually exaggerates the effect in favour of the intervention group
*   The time-frame for the primary outcome – in-hospital events – introduces the possibility of distortion of the results due to ‘clipping’
    *   If patients get home but still die more often then this significant outcome will be missed
    *   30-day mortality is frequently used for a fairer assessment of outcome but this requires more trial resource to follow-up discharged patients

### The Bottom Line

*   This trial provides evidence against Intensive Insulin Therapy in patients administered hydrocortisone for septic shock, and furthermore there is no benefit from additional fludrocortisone
*   The narrow confidence intervals suggest that any true benefit is small and this must be balanced against the significant incidence of hypoglycaemia (NNH 12)
*   This adds to the theory regarding steroids in sepsis – if they are of benefit, counteracting the possibly harmful hyperglycaemia with tight glycaemic control does not make any difference to short-term patient outcomes compared to less-tight glycaemic control

Steroids in septic shock
========================

> We suggest against using IV hydrocortisone to treat septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability. If this is not achievable, we suggest IV hydrocortisone at a dose of 200 mg per day (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

[_Surviving Sepsis Campaign: International Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock 2016_](http://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/Fulltext/2017/03000/Surviving_Sepsis_Campaign___International.15.aspx)

### Background

The hypothalamus secretes corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), stimulating the release of adrenocorticotrophin hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary. This results in cortisol secretion from the adrenal glands.

Normal serum cortisol levels are thought to range between 5 and 24 mcg/dL, with significant variability depending on the time of day. During physiological stress, hypotension, or severe infection, the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is activated and diurnal variation is lost. Serum cortisol increases as a result, reaching levels as high as 40 to 50 mcg/dL. Suboptimal cortisol production during these periods has been termed ‘functional’ or ‘relative’ adrenal insufficiency. Whether serum cortisol response and exogenous administration in during episodes of functional insufficiency can predict and improve mortality respectively has been the focus of extensive debate for over 50 years.

### The theoretical benefit

### The early clinical trials

### 1960s

*   [Bennett](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/334681?redirect=true)
     (1963) – the first prospective randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies of steroid administration (100 mg of oral hydrocortisone vs placebo) as an adjunctive strategy for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock
    *   Findings: No significant survival difference between the treatment and control groups

### 1970s

*   [Schumer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/786190)
     (1976) – this study combined a prospective trial with a retrospective analysis contrasting two steroid regimens with placebo in adult surgical patients with septic shock
    *   Findings: Mortality rates of 11.6% and 9.3% were seen for patients treated with methylprednisolone (one or two doses of 30 mg/kg IV) and dexamethasone (one or two doses of 3 mg/kg IV), respectively, vs 38.4% for patients receiving placebo
    *   A concomitantly performed “retrospective” study showed similar results
*   Based on this paper, it became standard practice in the late 1970s and early 1980s to administer high-dose corticosteroids at the onset of septic shock
*   The study has a number of limitations based on our current understanding of sepsis and the evolution of study designs. These include: a single investigator enrolled all 500 patients (prospective and retrospective) in a single hospital over a 9-year period; sepsis defined as a “a septic history,” a “falling BP,” or positive blood cultures; a primary outcome of death attributable to septic shock was subjective, including “. . . if the patient succumbed immediately to the shock episode or had a continuing septic course with episodes of shock and then succumbed.”

### 1980’s

*   4 studies assessing mortality outcome in patients with septic shock were published. None showed any survival benefit with steroids in septic shock
    *   [Sprung](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6384785)
         (1984) – 59 patients in a single centre received either methylprednisolone, 30 mg/kg IV, dexamethasone, 6 mg/kg IV, or placebo
        *   Findings: more rapid shock reversal but no survival benefit beyond 10 days of follow up
    *   [Veterans Administration Trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2888017)
         (1987) – RCT with 233 patients randomised to methylprednisolone, 30 mg/kg followed by 5 mg/kg, or to placebo, administered within 3 h of diagnosis
        *   Findings: No difference in 14-day mortality or  
            complications was demonstrated
    *   [Bone](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3306374)
         (1987) – RCT with 381 patients randomised to receive methylprednisolone, 30 mg/kg, or placebo
        *   Findings: higher mortality rate in the steroid group
    *   [Luce](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3202402)
         (1988) – 87 patients in a single centre received either methylprednisolone, 30 mg/kg per dose, or placebo (mannitol) for a total of 4 doses every 6 h, following the presumptive diagnosis of septic shock
        *   Findings: no improvement in survival or prevalence of ARDS
*   As a result of these pivotal trials, steroid use in septic shock began to dwindle in the late 1980’s and 1990’s. Supra-physiological doses of steroids were recognised as having no benefit and considered potentially harmful

### 2000’s

*   [Annane](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12186604)
     (2002) – a multicentre French study involving 19 ICU’s from 1995 to 1999 reignited the debate about the potential benefits of steroids in a select cohort of patients with septic shock. This study formed the basis for our use of exogenous glucocorticoids in septic shock for several years
    *   300 patients were randomised within eight hours of the onset of septic shock to receive placebo or hydrocortisone (50 mg intravenously every six hours) plus fludrocortisone (50 mcg enterally once a day) for seven days
    *   Based upon a high dose (250 mcg) ACTH stimulation test, all patients were classified as having adequate adrenal reserve (maximum increase in serum cortisol of >9 mcg/dL = >250nmol/L) or inadequate adrenal reserve (maximum cortisol increase of 9 mcg/dL = <250nmol/L)
        *   Findings: Hydrocortisone administration was associated with decreased 28-day mortality (53% vs. 63 %), ICU mortality (58% vs. 70%), hospital mortality (61% vs. 72%) and shorter duration of vasopressor use in those patients with inadequate adrenal reserve (the ‘non responders’)

![](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-21.15.20.png)

*   *   The limitations of this study include:
        *   the statistical methods used to derive mortality
            *   an adjusted mortality analysis using a regression model derived from a prior study was used. This yielded  lower P-values. The unadjusted P-value for 28 day mortality in the non-responders is 0.11
        *   24% of patients received etomidate (inhibits adrenal corticosteroid synthesis)
        *   use of fludrocortisone, a potential confounder
        *   timing to antibiotics was delayed, compared to current standards (mean 6hrs in placebo vs. 7.1hrs in steroid group)
*   [Oppert](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16276166)
     (2005) – 41 consecutive patients with with early hyperdynamic septic shock were randomised to receive either low-dose hydrocortisone (50-mg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 0.18 mg/kg body of weight/hr) or matching placebo
    *   Findings: treatment with low-dose hydrocortisone accelerates shock reversal in early hyperdynamic septic shock. This was accompanied by reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting both haemodynamic and immunomodulatory effects of steroid treatment
*   [CORTICUS](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/corticus/)
     (2008) – 499 patients with severe sepsis recruited from 52 participating ICUs
    *   Severe sepsis based on all of the following:
        *   clinical evidence of infection; systemic response to inflammation; shock (systolic BP < 90 mmHg despite 1 hour fluid resuscitation, or the need for vasopressors); organ dysfunction attributable to shock
    *   Hydrocortisone given as 50 mg in 6-hourly boluses for 5 days and then tapered over 6 days vs placebo
    *   499 patients recruited. This study under recruited based on the power calculations and in addition, the actual mortality (~38%) was much lower than estimated mortality used for power calculation (50%)
    *   Findings: no difference in 28-day mortality in short corticotropin non-responders (i.e. the sub-group that were more likely to benefit from exogenous corticosteroids)
        *   39.2% in hydrocortisone group vs. 36.1% in placebo group  
            P=0.69
        *   See [TBL review of CORTICUS](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/corticus/)

### 2010-2018

*   [COIITSS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20103758)
     (2010) – A multicenter (11 ICUs in France), RCT, involving 509 adults with septic shock and SOFA score of 8 or more
    *   Factorial (2×2) assessing the efficacy of intensive insulin therapy in patients whose septic shock was treated with hydrocortisone (50mg bolus every 6 hours for 7 days) and to assess, as a secondary objective, the benefit of fludrocortisone
    *   Compared with conventional insulin therapy, intensive insulin therapy did not improve in-hospital mortality among patients who were treated with hydrocortisone for septic shock. The addition of oral fludrocortisone did not result in a statistically significant improvement in in-hospital mortality
*   [VANISH Trial](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/vanish/)
     (2016) – 421 adult patients (≥16 years) who had sepsis (2 of 4 systemic inflammatory response criteria due to known or suspected infection) and who required vasopressors despite adequate intravenous fluid resuscitation
    *   Factorial (2×2) multicenter, double blind, RCT
        *   Study drug 1: Noradrenaline or Vasopressin
        *   Study drug 2: Hydrocortisone or placebo
    *   Early vasopressin maintains blood pressure and reduces the requirement for norepinephrine and renal replacement therapy. However, vasopressin does not reduce the number of renal replacement free days or mortality rate, and there was no clinical interaction with corticosteroids

     (2016) – Single centre, unblinded and retrospective observational study
    *   47 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and a procalcitonin (PCT) >2 ng/ml
    *   Vitamin C + Hydrocortisone + Thiamine in addition to standard treatment
        *   1.5g QDS Vitamin C intravenously for 4 days or until ICU discharge
        *   Hydrocortisone 50mg QDS intravenously for 7 days or until ICU discharge followed by a taper over 3 days
        *   200mg thiamine BD for 4 days or until ICU discharge
        *   Before and after study
    *   Primary outcome: Hospital mortality – 8.5% (4 of 47) in the treatment group compared to 40.4% (19 of 47) in the control group (p < 0.001)
*   [HYPRESS](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/hypress/)
     (2016) – randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial in 34 study sites in Germany
    *   Assessed whether hydrocortisone compared to placebo prevents the development of septic shock?
        *   Bolus of hydrocortisone iv 50mg followed by a 24 hr continuous infusion of 200mg for 5 days, 100mg for Day 6 & 7, 50mg on Day 8 & 9 and 25mg on Day 10 & 11. The continuous infusion was preferred to prevent unwanted undulation in blood glucose concentrations
        *   The placebo was lyophilized mannitol which was indistinguishable from the hydrocortisone (133mg mannitol – a tiny dose compared with therapeutic mannitol for raised ICP = 1g/kg)
        *   Administration of hydrocortisone did not prevent the development of shock in patients with severe sepsis
*   [Early initiation of low-dose hydrocortisone treatment for septic shock in adults: A randomized clinical trial](http://www.ajemjournal.com/article/S0735-6757(17)30444-8/fulltext)
     (2017) – 118 patients with septic shock were randomised to receive hydrocortisone or 0.9% saline.
    *   The study medication (hydrocortisone and normal saline) was initiated simultaneously with vasopressors
    *   The early initiation of low-dose of hydrocortisone did not decrease the risk of mortality, and the length of stay in the ICU or hospital in adults with septic shock.

### Systematic reviews and meta-analyses

Pre-CORTICUS

[Annane](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC515196/)
 (2004) – 16 RCTs or quasi-RCT’s, including 2063 patients were selected. For all trials, regardless of duration of treatment and dose, use of corticosteroids did not significantly affect mortality. With long courses of low doses of corticosteroids, however, mortality at 28 days and hospital morality was reduced.

Post-CORTICUS

[Sligl](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19489712)
 (2009) – 8 studies (6 RCTs) involving a total of 1876 patients were selected. In patients with septic shock, corticosteroid therapy appears to be safe but does not reduce 28-day all-cause mortality rates. It does, however, significantly reduce the incidence of vasopressor-dependent shock.

[Sherwin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22221983)
 – (2012) – The Sepsis Sub-committee of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine Clinical Practice Committee identified seven relevant trials and concluded that low-dose corticosteroids may reverse shock faster; however, mortality is not improved.

[Wang](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24445635)
 (2014) – 8 RCTs’ found low dose hydrocortisone therapy decreased shock at 7 and 28 days, with no change in mortality.

[Cochrane review](http://www.cochrane.org/CD002243/ANAESTH_corticosteroids-treating-sepsis)
 (2015) – included a total of 33 RCTs, accounting for 4268 hospitalised patients with sepsis. Three trials included children, and the remaining 30 trials included only adults. Corticosteroids were compared with placebo in all except five trials, in which they were compared with standard therapy alone. Low-quality evidence indicates that steroids reduce mortality among patients with sepsis. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that a long course of low-dose steroids reduced 28-day mortality without inducing major complications.

[Gibbison](https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13054-017-1659-4?site=ccforum.biomedcentral.com)
 (2017) – Complete data from 22 studies and partial data from 1 study were included. There was no clear evidence that any one corticosteroid drug or treatment regimen is more likely to be effective in reducing mortality or reducing the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding or superinfection in septic shock. Hydrocortisone delivered as a bolus or as an infusion was more likely than placebo and methylprednisolone to result in shock reversal

### The Bottom Line…so far

*   Steroids do not reduce mortality in patients with sepsis based on the evidence to date. A RCT is required to further assess the efficacy and safety profile of combined steroid with thiamine and vitamin C
*   Steroids may improve the rate of shock reversal, based on reduced vasopressor requirement
*   High dose steroids for prolonged periods are harmful
*   It remains unclear whether administering steroids as a bolus or as an infusion has comparable efficacy in the context of sepsis

    It would appear that use of steroids in sepsis does not reduce 28 day mortality but instead provides a window of opportunity. I suggest that Dr Paul Marik’s use of Vitamin C and Thiamine makes the best current use of that window.

    The control in the Marik study was not placebo – it was a before-and-after study

================================================================================

Venkatesh. NEJM 2018; published on line first 19th January 2018 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1705835

### Clinical Question

*   In critically ill patients with septic shock, does hydrocortisone compared with placebo, reduce 90 day mortality?

*   Sample size calculation
    *   3800 patients will provide 90% power to detect a 5% absolute risk reduction, from a baseline mortality rate of 33%, with a false positive rate of 5%; allowing for a 1% rate of withdrawal/loss to follow-up

### Setting

*   69 medical–surgical ICUs
    *   Australia (45 sites), UK (12), New Zealand (8), Saudi Arabia (3), and Denmark (1)

    *   United Kingdom: 35.3% vs. 31.7% (median APACHE II Score 25)

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   Among patients with septic shock undergoing mechanical ventilation, a continuous infusion of hydrocortisone did not result in lower 90-day mortality than placebo

### Strengths

*   Randomised controlled trial
*   Multi-centre, including a number of different countries
*   Intention to treat analysis
*   Appropriate primary outcome
*   Registered on [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01448109)
    
*   The largest study to date, investigating steroids in septic shock

### Weaknesses

*   Whilst the use of antibiotic therapy was recorded, appropriate choice based on microbiology analyses was not
*   Long-term neuromuscular weakness as an adverse event was not not assessed
*   Greater rate of withdrawal/loss to follow up than anticipated
*   7.4% in intervention group and 8.8% of patients in placebo group received open-label steroids
*   A number of patients remained on vasopressors when the trial intervention completed

### The Bottom Line

*   In mechanically ventilated patients with septic shock, low dose hydrocortisone administered via an infusion for up to 7 days does not reduce or increase mortality at 90 days
*   Secondary outcomes demonstrated that patients in the hydrocortisone group had a reduced time to resolution of shock, reduced duration of ICU but not hospital stay, reduced time to cessation of mechanical ventilation and a reduction in the use of blood transfusion. Adverse events were low, but significantly increased in the hydrocortisone group

    This is a great trial! It was fantastic to hear Bala Venkatesh present the findings and conclusion at the Critical Care Review meeting in Belfast. Some really interesting points were raised by the audience and by Karin Amrein. She asked whether early deaths should be excluded due to the slow mechanism of action from corticosteroids. The audience were interested in the secondary outcomes: reduced time to extubation, reduced length of stay and reduced blood transfusion. Not everyone seemed convinced but even Simon Finfer admitted there might be something in it.  
    My department, who do use steroids at various points within an episode of shock, will probably increase our use of steroids but we aren’t sure how much we can extrapolate: when should we start steroids; by infusion or bolus; continue to shock resolution or seven days; cut or taper?  
    Please leave a comment with your interpretation.

        Great study. While disappointing not to have a mortality benefit, the secondary outcomes are of clinical significance and are likely to increase the use of hydrocortisone in our ICU. At the moment we use bolus dosing, which has been shownpreviously to be non-inferior to continuous infusions, but with more hyperglycaemia and less need for additional lines (Hoang H, Wang S, Islam S, Hanna A, Axelrad A, Brathwaite C. Evaluation of hydrocortisone continuous infusion versus intermittent boluses in resolution of septic shock. P T. 2017; 42 (4): 252-255.). We tend to initiate hydrocortisone once noradrenaline infusion rate goes beyond 10mcg/min and we have variation in practice in terms of tapering or stopping hydrocortisone once vasopressor support is off. The timing of hydrocortisone initiation would be an interesting future study to guide practice.

    Admission= previously a steroid sceptic
    
    I think this trial was really well done but has left us with many more questions to answer. The secondary outcomes show some clinically important improvement with steroids but what dose should we use? What advantage does an infusion hold over a bolus? Considering Karin Amrein’s points, should we be starting steroids in the ED as soon as vasopressors are commenced?
    
    Lots to consider but I would seriously consider early steroids in septic shock now.

    I think the take home from ADRENAL should be that the drugs don’t work – the bottom line is the body count, no difference in mortality at 90 days.
    
    If you assess enough secondary outcomes some will be statistically significant – these are merely hypothesis generating.
    
    It might just be that steroids buff the things we look at to decide on extubation and discharge but don’t really help patients.
    
    “Resolution of shock” as an outcome isn’t really about shock, but when the clinician thinks the MAP is sufficient to stop vasopressors and not restart them. Does that matter to patients?
    
    Of course we can’t exclude subgroups that benefit etc; and the question of refractory septic shock isn’t answered by this trial (nor is the –
    
    (Reserve the right to use steroids in select patients, blah blah, etc etc, of course)
    
    Cheers

================================================================

Annane. NEJM 2018; 378: 809-818. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1705716

### Clinical Question

*   In critically ill patients with septic shock, does the combination of hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone therapy reduce 90 day mortality?

### Background

*   The use of steroids in critically ill patients continues to be controversial. Whilst there are signals for improved cardiovascular parameters, this did not translate to clear mortality benefits.
*   The most recent of these trials ([ADRENAL, 2018](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/adrenal/)
    ), concluded that among patients with septic shock undergoing mechanical ventilation, a continuous infusion of hydrocortisone did not result in lower 90-day mortality than placebo.

### Design

*   Multi-centre
*   Randomised placebo controlled trial
*   Double blinded
*   Initially designed to have 4 parallel groups to evaluate benefits/risks of steroids and drotrecogin alfa (DAA) in a 2 by 2 factorial design
    *   Original 4 groups
        *   Group 1: Corticosteroids placebo + DAA placebo
        *   Group 2: Corticosteroids + DAA placebo
        *   Group 3: Corticosteroids placebo + DAA
        *   Group 4: Corticosteroids + DAA
    *   When drotrecogin alfa was withdrawn from the market, the trial was continued with 2 parallel groups
        *   Group 1 and 3 combined
        *   Group 2 and 4 combined
*   Randomised by permuted blocks of 8
*   Intention to treat analysis
*   Sample size calculation
    *   Based on anticipated 90 day mortality of 45% among pts with septic shock
    *   320 pts required in each of the original 4 groups (1280 pts total) for 95% power to detect an absolute difference of 10% in 90 day mortality (α=0.05)

### Setting

*   34 French ICUs
*   September 2008 – June 2015
    *   Trial suspended twice: October 2011 – May 2012 (DAA withdrawal) and July 2014 – October 2014 (request of data and safety monitoring board to check the quality of the trial agents and the distribution of the serious adverse events)

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   In critically ill patients with septic shock, the addition of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone compared to placebo was associated with a significant improvement in mortality at 90 days.

### Strengths

*   Randomised controlled trial
*   Multi-centre
*   Intention to treat analysis
*   Appropriate primary outcome
*   Appropriateness of antibiotic therapy recorded

### Weaknesses

*   The trial was initially designed and powered with DAA being part of the therapy. The withdrawal of DAA has impacted aspects of this trial including statistical power calculation
    *   Statistical analysis published in supplementary material suggest no interaction with DAA and other treatments
    *   The Fragility Index for several of the outcomes (including primary outcome) in favour of intervention is in single figures
*   Outcome of Synacthen test conducted pre-randomisation was not mentioned or discussed in main paper
    *   Results discussed in supplementary material section where there was no difference between responders and non-responders in those from which the Synacthen test was actually conducted
*   The trial was conducted using the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines from 2008 which has since been updated
*   Very sick patient population – the high doses of vasopressors used in the trial population may limit external validity
*   Not all secondary endpoints included in original trial protocol reported on in final manuscript

### The Bottom Line

*   The addition of fludrocortisone and its effect is less well investigated compared to hydrocortisone by itself. It is not my current practice to administer this drug for refractory septic shock
*   Primary and secondary outcomes, including safety profile, shows a trend in favour of the corticosteroid group (consistent with the findings of the ADRENAL trial)
*   I will continue my current practice of using hydrocortisone IV (6 hourly) for refractory septic shock

RECOVERY
========

RECOVERY Collaborative Group. Preliminary Report. Released June 22 2020

### Clinical Question

*   In hospitalised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection does dexamethasone in additional to usual care, compared to usual care alone, reduce 28-day mortality?

### Background

*   In December 2019 the Wuhan province in China became the epicentre of a devastating, highly contagious viral infection, SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 illness
*   By March 2020, the World Health Organisation announced they were deeply concerned by the alarming levels of spread and severity of the disease and characterised COVID-19 as a pandemic
*   To date there are more than 11 million confirmed cases worldwide and 500 000 deaths
*   There are many trials running in COVID-19 patients, with the hope to find effective therapeutic options. To date the trials have been of variable quality or have only released preliminary data with incomplete follow-up, for example [ACTT-1](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/actt-1/)
     trial for remdesivir
*   Corticosteroids have been used in similar syndromes as COVID-19 including SARS, MERS, influenza and severe community acquired pneumonia. However, there is poor evidence in these cohorts as trials conducted have been underpowered or had methodological flaws
*   The **RECOVERY** (**R**andomised **E**valuation of **COV**id-19 th**ER**ap**Y**) trial describes an overarching trial design that looks at different treatment options simultaneously in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, in an adaptive design. The treatments being studied are:
    *   Group A
        *   No additional treatment
        *   Corticosteroid in the form of dexamethasone administered as an oral (liquid or tablets) or intravenous preparation 6 mg once daily for 10 days. In pregnancy or breastfeeding women, prednisolone 40 mg administered by mouth (or intravenous hydrocortisone 80 mg twice daily) administered instead of dexamethasone
        *   Lopinavir 400mg-Ritonavir 100mg by mouth (or nasogastric tube) every 12 hours for 10 days (The arm of this trial has ceased recruitment, as no benefit demonstrated)
        *   Hydroxychloroquine (this arm of the trial has ceased recruitment, as no benefit demonstrated)
        *   Azithromycin 500mg by mouth (or nasogastric tube) or intravenously once daily for 10 days
    *   Group B
        *   In addition to these treatments patients can be randomised to receive convalescent plasma or not
    *   Group C
        *   If there is evidence of a progressive inflammatory state patients can be randomised to receive Tocilizumab or not
*   This review looks at the dexamethasone arm of the RECOVERY trial

### Design

*   Unblinded adaptive randomised control trial
*   Following written consent from the patient or next of kin, patients were randomised to dexamethasone 6mg once per day for 10 days (or less if hospital discharge occurred) and compared to patients randomised to usual care alone
*   Patients were hospitalised and were not necessarily in intensive care
*   Patients were allocated using a central web-based randomisation service (without stratification or minimisation)
*   Patients were randomised in a ratio of 2:1:1:1:1 (usual care: dexamethasone: lopinivir/ritonavir: hydroxychloroquine: azithromycin)
*   Sample Size was calculated as the trial progressed, as the 28-day mortality was difficult to predict at the beginning of the pandemic
    *   So if mortality was 20%, then 2000 patients needed allocation to the drug and 4000 to usual care to yield a 90% power at 2-sided p = 0.01 to detect an absolute difference of 4% difference in mortality between groups
*   There was no blinding
*   Pre-specified subgroups were age, sex, days since symptom onset, predicted 28-day mortality risk AND level of respiratory support \[Mechanical ventilation, O2 only (including NIV), no O2\]
*   Hazard ratio from Cox regression used to estimate mortality ratio, and Kaplan-Meier curves constructed to display cumulative 28 day mortality
*   Effects within subgroup categories were compared using a chi-squared test for trend
*   Analysis was by intention to treat
*   The independent Data Monitoring Committee reviewed unblinded study data at intervals of around 2 weeks

### Setting

*   Multi-centre: 176 NHS hospitals in the UK
*   For this dexamethasone arm, patients were randomised between March 9 2020 and June 8 2020

### Population

*   **Inclusion**:
    *   clinically suspected or proven SARS-CoV-2 infection
    *   age >18 years (but after May 9 no age limit)
    *   patients were permitted to be included if pregnant or breast-feeding
*   **Exclusion**:
    *   a known indication or contraindication to dexamethasone
    *   Dexamethasone unavailable in hospital at time of randomisation
*   A total of 2104 patients were randomised to dexamethasone once/day for ten days and compared to 4321 patients randomised to usual care alone.
*   Mean age was 66.1 years, 36% were female, Diabetes in 24%, heart disease in 27%, chronic lung disease 21%
*   56% had at least one major comorbidity
*   There were 6 pregnant patients
*   Mean age was 1.1 years older in the patients allocated to dexamethasone, otherwise baseline characteristics were similar between groups
    *   As age is a powerful contributor to mortality, results are presented with and without adjustment for age

### Intervention

*   Dexamethasone
    *   6mg daily dexamethasone for 10 days: intravenous or oral
    *   In pregnant or breastfeeding women, prednisolone 40 mg administered by mouth (or intravenous hydrocortisone 80 mg twice daily)

### Control

*   Usual care

#### Management common to both groups

*   Other management as per caring physicians was not protocolised
*   Use of azithromycin was similar between groups (23% vs 24%). Very few patients received hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, or IL-6 antagonists, and in similar proportions between groups
*   Remdesivir only became available in the UK after May 26 2020
*   It is not clear from this preliminary data, how many patients in each group were also randomised to group B, ie convalescent serum
*   1% of patients randomised to dexamethasone also received Tocilizumab. 2% in the usual care group

### Outcome

*   **Compliance with treatment:** 95% of treatment arm received at least one dose of dexamethasone and 7% of control arm received dexamethasone
*   **Primary outcome**: 28-Day mortality (dexamethasone vs usual care) – significantly reduced in dexamethasone group
    *   Vital status:
        *   Age-adjusted mortality 21.6% vs 24.6% \[Rate Ratio 0.83; 95% CI 0.74-0.92, p<0.001\].
        *   When not adjusted for the age imbalance in the baseline the result was similar \[Rate Ratio 0.86; 95% CI 0.77-0.96, p=0.006 \]
    *   NOTE: rate ratio is closely related to risk ratio and is computed as the ratio of the incidence rate in the dexamethasone group divided by the incidence rate in the usual care group
*   **Secondary outcome**: (dexamethasone vs usual care)
    *   Pre-specified subgroups
        *   Mechanically ventilated: 28-day mortality – significantly reduced in dexamethasone group
            *   29% vs 40.7% \[Rate Ratio 0.65; 95% CI 0.51-0.82, p<0.001\]
            *   Mechanically ventilated patients were on average 10 years younger than those not receiving respiratory support and were randomised on average 7 days later after symptom onset than those not receiving support
        *   Patients receiving O2: 28-day mortality – significantly reduced in dexamethasone group
            *   21.5% vs 25% \[Rate Ratio 0.80; 95% CI 0.70-0.92, p = 0.002\]
        *   Patients not receiving respiratory support: no significant difference
            *   17% vs 13.2% \[Rate Ratio 1.22; 95% CI 0.93-1.61 p=0.14\]
        *   Time from symptom onset to randomisation influenced outcome. Dexamethasone was associated with a reduction in 28-day mortality among those symptoms for >7 days but not among those with symptoms for <7 days (test for trend p<0.001)
    *   Length of hospital stay – significantly reduced in dexamethasone group
        *   median 12 days vs 13 days
    *   Composite secondary outcome of invasive mechanical ventilation and death – significantly reduced in dexamethasone group
        *   Rate Ratio 0.91; 95% CI 0.82-1.00, p=0.049
    *   Use of ventilation – significantly reduced in dexamethasone group
        *   Rate Ratio 0.76; 95% CI 0.61-0.96, p=0.021
    *   Use of renal dialysis or haemofiltration: not reported
    *   Documented new major cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial and ventricular arrhythmias): not reported

### Authors’ Conclusions

*   Dexamethasone at a dose of 6mg/day given for 10 days reduces 28-day mortality in patients with COVID-19.
*   The effect is best demonstrated in mechanically ventilated patients NNT=8
*   It is also apparent in patients needing oxygen therapy NNT=25
*   It does not look to be helpful (and may be harmful) in patients not requiring mechanical ventilation OR oxygen therapy
*   It is likely more helpful if started > 7 days after symptom onset

### Strengths

*   A remarkable trial conducted rapidly in the setting of a rapidly evolving global pandemic
*   Allocation concealment, intention to treat analysis, near complete follow-up (95%)
*   Robust, clinically meaningful outcomes
*   Relevant pre-specified subgroups
*   This sample is suitable for extrapolation to the global population
*   The subgroups of the [ADRENAL](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/adrenal/)
     trial and [APROCCHS](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/aprocchss/)
     trial, who received steroids, with pneumonia and ventilation also had better outcomes, adding support to the subgroup in this trial having a mortality benefit
*   The recent [DEXA-ARDS](https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/dexa-ards/)
     trial also showed a similar benefit

### Weaknesses

*   Primary outcome only available in 95% (5% of patients had not reached Day 28 and data was extrapolated on their likely outcomes, although there are some inconsistencies in the numbers in this preliminary report)
*   Flaws exist with the adaptive trial design:
    *   The trial was unblinded
    *   Usual care was not standardised, and rapidly evolved between March and May 2020 in the UK (For instance, noninvasive ventilation moved from being not recommended to being recommended within a few weeks)
    *   The sample size was not set a priori, nor the point for an interim analysis. This may increase the chance of a Type 1 error (false positive)
    *   The number of treatment arms in the overall trial also increase the chance of a Type 1 error
*   It is unclear as to how patients died
*   Conclusions drawn from sub-group analysis can be spurious or happen by chance, but given the overall results favour dexamethasone and there is a physiological rationale that dexamethasone would benefit sicker patients more, ie those with inflammatory lung complications, the result is credible
*   There is little information in this preliminary report about baseline severity of illness
*   The mortality in the ventilated group is high (40.7%) compared to some countries (although this is compatible with the [UK ICNARC data](https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits/Cmp/Reports)
    )
    *   For example, in Australia, although only a small sample size, the hospital mortality in ventilated COVID-19 patients of 22% according to ANZICS data
    *   The capacity strain, ICU admission practices and threshold for ventilation varies enormously between countries- raising some doubt about the external validity of these results
*   The follow-up beyond 28 days may be particularly important to assess harm from steroids due to deconditioning or delayed sepsis for example. In addition, a 28-day follow-up may not be long enough to detect mortality, for example, it is not clear from the data how many patients remained in the ICU at Day 28 and did they in fact die beyond this time point.
*   The trial includes patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and 15% of patients did not have proven PCR, a small weakness in the scheme of this trial being conducted in an overwhelming pandemic

### The Bottom Line

*   This large trial demonstrates a significant benefit from the administration of dexamethasone to hospitalised COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation
*   Based on this trial, if I had a patient in my ICU with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen or ventilation, I would administer dexamethasone 6mg daily, for 10 days
