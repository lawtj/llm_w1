JAMA\u00a02020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.17022\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with severe COVID-19, does intravenous hydrocortisone (either as a fixed dose or restricted to when shock is clinically evident) compared with standard care, improve 21-day organ support free days?\nThe study is part of the wider REMAP-CAP trial which aims to determine the best treatment strategies for patients with severe pneumonia (both in pandemic and non pandemic settings)\n\nBackground\n\nCOVID-19 has resulted in 13,710 critical care admissions in the UK (to 7th September 2020) of which ~39% have died\nRecent trials investigating the use of steroids in COVID-19 include RECOVERY and the CoDEX trial\nA meta-analysis, of 7 randomised trials including REMAP-CAP, published in JAMA on the same date as this trial, found that corticosteroid administration was associated with a lower 28 day mortality\n\nDesign\n\nAdaptive platform trial\nInternational, multicenter, open-label\nPatient\u2019s randomised to multiple interventions within multiple domains\n\nA domain is a common therapeutic intervention, in this case the use (or no use) of hydrocortisone\nOther domains included anti-viral, targeted immune modulation, immunoglobulin and therapeutic anticoagulation\n\n\nPatient\u2019s can be randomised to multiple domains\n\ne.g. hydrocortisone and antiviral medication\n\n\nRandomised via computer software in balanced manner\nPre-specified secondary outcomes\nStaff not blinded to treatments\n\nInternational Trial Steering Committee were blinded\n\n\nSample size calculated based on trial simulations and with 90% power to determine if either group was superior to no hydrocortisone\n\nIf OR 1.75 \u2013 500 patients\nIf OR 1.5 \u2013 1000 patients\n\n\nBayesian statistics used\n\nPlease see \u201cBayesian Statistics\u201d review for more detailed explanation\nPrimary model adjusted for site, age, sex and time period (2 week blocks), and pre-specified interactions in the model between various domains\nPrimary analysis conducted on all patients who met inclusion criteria, not just those randomised within corticosteroid domain\nRe-analysis of primary outcome then repeated in patients enrolled in corticosteroid domain\nInternal statistical triggers for conclusion of trial and dissemination of results were pre-existing\nDesigned so that an OR >1 shows benefit\n\n\nWritten or verbal informed consent from all participants or surrogates\nRelevant ethical approval at all sites\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\n\nSetting\n\n121 sites in multiple countries\nMarch 9th \u2013 June 17th 2020\n\nDue to reporting of RECOVERY results steering committee decided to cease recruitment to the corticosteroid domain due to lack of equipoise\n\nNo data had been reviewed prior to this decision\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nPlatform Inclusion (into REMAP-CAP):\n\nAdult patient admitted to hospital with suspected or proven COVID-19\n\n\nCorticosteroid Domain Inclusion:\n\nSevere disease state, defined by receiving respiratory (HFNC > 30L and FiO2 > 0.4, NIV or invasive ventilation) or cardiovascular support (any vasopressor or inotrope) in an intensive care unit (ICU)\n\n\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nKnown hypersensitivity\nIntention to prescribe systemic corticosteroids for a reason unrelated to CAP / COVID-19 (e.g. chronic steroid use)\nAdmission to ICU > 36 hours ago\nPrior randomisation into a trial evaluating corticosteroids\nTreating clinician believes not in patient\u2019s best interest\n\n\n1165 screened \u2013> 614 enrolled in REMAP-CAP Severe COVID arm\n\n403 enrolled into the corticosteroid domain\n\n143 fixed dose, 152 shock dose and 108 to no hydrocortisone\n\n\n\n\nBaseline demographics were fairly well balanced (as documented in table below)\n\nIntervention\n\nHydrocortisone administration\n\nFixed dose: 50mg q6 hourly for 7 days (2 patients received 100mg q6 hourly)\n\nHigh dose hydrocortisone arm (100mg q 6 hourly) had been a treatment option but given only two patients received the high dose treatment prior to recruitment being stopped the two arms were combined into one \u201cfixed dose hydrocortisone arm\u201d\n\nThese two treatments were \u201cnested\u201d together so this is amalgamation is permitted in an adaptive design\n\n\nn= 143, of whom 6 withdrew consent\n\n\nShock-dependent: 50mg q6 hourly whilst in shock (up to 28 days)\n\nDefined as the use of vasopressor due to COVID-19 (and not another cause such as sedation)\nn= 152, of whom 6 withdrew consent and a further 5 had outcome data that was not available\n43% of patients received at least 1 dose of hydrocortisone with a median duration of 3 days\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNo hydrocortisone\n\nn = 108, of whom 7 withdrew consent\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nNo ongoing management prescribed but patients could be randomised to other domains in the platform\nIn all groups systemic corticosteroids could be given if a new clinical indication developed for which steroids are established treatment e.g. post-extubation stridor\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nRespiratory and cardiovascular organ support-free days, up to day 21 \u2013 no significant difference\n\nOrgan support defined using same criteria as study inclusion criteria\n\n\nUsing data from all patients with severe COVID-19 the probability that hydrocortisone is beneficial if compared to no hydrocortisone when assessing number of organ free days is:\n\n93% for a fixed regime\n80% for a shock regime (note only 43% received hydrocortisone)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes (comparing fixed dose vs. shock-dependent vs. no hydrocortisone; Odds ratio (OR) compared to no hydrocortisone group \u2013 fixed dose vs shock-dependent group)\n\nIn hospital mortality\n\n30% vs. 26% vs. 33%\nOR 1.03 (95% C.I. 0.53-1.95) vs. 1.10 (95% C.I. 0.58-2.11)\n% probability of superiority of hydrocortisone to no hydrocortisone (fixed dose vs. shock dependent in all patients with severe COVID-19)\n\n54% vs. 62%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n% probability of superiority of hydrocortisone to no hydrocortisone (fixed dose vs. shock dependent for patients solely in the corticosteroid domain)\n\nTime to death: 40% vs. 47%\nRespiratory organ support free days: 94% vs. 85%\nCardiovascular organ support free days: 98% vs. 86%\nLength of ICU stay: 29% (fixed) vs. 14% (shock)\nHospital length of stay: 43%\u00a0 vs. 31%\nWHO score at day 14: 87%\u00a0 vs. 55%\nProgression to invasive ventilation, ECMO or death (for those not intubated at baseline, n = 168): 99% vs. 70%\n\n\nAdverse events:\n\nPatient\u2019s with serious adverse event:\n\nFixed 3%, Shock 4%, None 1%\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nTreatment with a 7-day fixed-dose course of hydrocortisone or shock-dependent dosing of hydrocortisone (compared with no hydrocortisone) resulted in 93% and 80% probabilities of superiority with regard to the odds of improvement in organ support\u2013free days within 21 days\nIt is re-iterated that neither hydrocortisone groups met the pre-specified criteria for statistical superiority and thus definitive conclusions cannot be drawn\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre international, randomised trial with a pragmatic design\nThe presentation of Bayesian results gives a \u201creal-life\u201d probability by which the treatment being tested may be beneficial:\n\nThis appears easier to interpret for both clinicians and when discussing treatments with non clinicians\n\n\nThe use of all patients, and not just those in the corticosteroid domain, enables the maximal amount of information available to be studied.\n\nThis increases the accuracy of the adjustments made in the primary model (e.g. those for age, sex, time)\nThe use of two analyses serves to confirm the stability of the results\n\n\nThe prior based on information from ICNARC\n\nWeaknesses\n\n15% (n = 15) of the no hydrocortisone group did receive a systemic corticosteroid, of which the median duration was 2 days\n\nAll groups were allowed to receive systemic corticosteroid therapy if a new clinical indication allowed (e.g. post extubation stridor)\nIt could be debated as to whether this would affect outcomes \u2013 if steroids are favourable, then the administration to the no hydrocortisone group would only likely serve to reduce the probability by which corticosteroid administration is deemed to be beneficial\n\n\nOnly 43% in the shock group received at least 1 dose of hydrocortisone\n\nThe authors state that if corticosteroids are beneficial in COVID-19 (in ways other then mitigating shock) then this group maybe under-treated\n\nThis may result in the 80% probability being underestimated\n\n\n\n\nWith regards to patient selection:\n\nof the 1165 patients assessed, 42 of these were excluded as the clinician intended to administer corticosteroids, and of the 614 who met the severe COVID-19 definition, 38 were excluded as the clinician intended to administer corticosteroids\n\nThis may result in some selection bias as this is ~7% of all patients assessed\n\n\n\n\nGroups not completely balanced at baseline \u2013 lower use of mechanical ventilation and vasopressors in the arm that received no corticosteroids\nTrial not blinded\n\nThe authors make a very rational argument that blinding would have impacted significantly on the speed in which this trial was set up and able to enrol patients (which is important in a pandemic)\n\n\n6% of patients withdrew consent or did not have outcome data available. There is concern of this introducing bias, particularly in an open label trial\nNo low income countries randomised, and a large proportion (n = 419 in all domains) were randomised from the UK\nThe cessation of the trial earlier than planned meant that the pre-defined statistical triggers were not reached and thus definitive statistical conclusions can not be drawn\n\nGiven the trial was open label this was important to minimise (although highly unlikely) any protocol violations given the strongly positive effects shown in RECOVERY\nThe authors acknowledge that no optimal strategy of corticosteroid use is shown by this study\nPrescott and Rice in their JAMA editorial highlight many further clinical questions that still need to be answered\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe fact that such a large, international trial has been so rapidly and rigorously conducted alongside a significant burden of clinical critical care work is remarkably impressive\nAlthough no statistical triggers were reached, the Bayesian approach gives a high probability of superiority of corticosteroid use (compared to no corticosteroid use) in organ support free days within 21 days. It also reported a large reduction in the progression to invasive ventilation, ECMO or death with the use of steroids\nMedicine is a balance of benefit and risk. With the high probability of benefit and low evidence of harm from this study, combined with the evidence from the RECOVERY trial and the\u00a0WHO meta-analysis, I will continue to advocate for the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19\n\nExternal Links\n\nICNARC report on COVID-19 in Critical Care\nLife in the Fast Lane: Adaptive Trials\nSt Emelyns: The \u201cRoid\u201d to Recovery\nREBEL-EM: The COVID-19 Ordinal Scale of Clinical Improvement\nCritical Care Reviews:\u00a0REMAP-CAP Steroid Domain Results Podcast\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker @hgmwalker89\nSummary date: 9th September 2020\nPeer-review editor:@davidslessor\n\n\n"
