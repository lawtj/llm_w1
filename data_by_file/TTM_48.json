JAMA 2017: 25;318(4):341-350 doi: 10.1001/jama.2017.8978\nClinical Question\n\nIn adults with out of hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) due to a presumed cardiac cause, who are post \u2018return of spontaneous circulation\u2019 (ROSC), does cooling to 33\u00b0C for 48 hours, compared with 24 hours, improve improved neurological outcomes at 6 months?\n\nBackground\n\nTherapeutic cooling was established as an intervention for OOHCA patients and ROSC with the perceived benefit of reducing cerebral oxygen demand.\nIn the wake of the Targeted Temperature Management (TTM) trial, current guidelines, including the most recent European Resuscitation Council guidelines, now recommend TTM between 32-36\u00b0C, rather than the previously recommended 32-34\u00b0C(1).\nWhile current guidelines also recommend a minimum duration of 24hrs for TTM, this recommendation in itself is low quality evidence and is primarily based on the protocol undertaken in what are considered the two largest and better quality RCTs in this area.\nThese trials were not however designed to look at duration of cooling specifically.\nAlthough previous observational studies comparing 24 to 72 hours of hypothermia in OOHCA patients have failed to show any difference in mortality, randomized control trial (RCT) data looking at optimal periods of cooling as related to long term neurological outcomes is lacking and the optimal duration for cooling to any temperature, within the temperature bracket of 32-36\u00b0C remains poorly evidenced based.\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nWeb based randomisation with variable block size\nStratified by age, hospital site, initial rhythm\nParallel groups\nPragmatic trial\nClinicians and patients/relatives non-blinded\nBlinding of outcome assessors\nModified intention to treat analysis (included patients who initiated the intervention + did not withdraw consent)\nOutcomes assessed at 6 months by telephone or person-to-person interview\nPower calculation: 338 patients required to demonstrate an absolute difference of 15% (50% vs. 65%) in the primary outcome with a false negative rate of 20% and a false positive rate of 5%\n\nSetting\n\n10 European Intensive Care Units (Denmark, Belgium, Finland, Estonia, Germany, Norway)\nFebruary 2013 \u2013 June 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nAdults aged 18-80 years with OOHCA due to presumed cardiac cause with sustained ROSC and a Glasgow coma score (GCS) of \u2264 8.\n\n\nMain exclusion criteria:\n\nUnwitnessed asystole as initial presenting rhythm.\nEstimated time from collapse to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) of >60min\nEstimated time from OOHCA to cooling >240min\nOOHCA due to presumed non-cardiac cause\nSevere coagulopathy, not due to thrombolysis or anticoagulant therapy.\nSuspected or confirmed intracerebral bleeding or acute stroke\nPersistent cardiogenic shock\n\n\n907 patients assessed; 552 excluded\n176 and 179 patients randomised to 48hr and 24hr TTM groups respectively\nComparing baseline characteristics of 48hr vs. 24hr groups \u2013 no significant differences\n\nAge: 61 vs. 60\nUnwitnessed cardiac arrest: 9% vs. 8%\nShockable rhythm: 91% vs. 86%\nTime to ROSC, median (IQR): 20 (15-30) vs. 21 (16-27)\nImmediate coronary angiography: 83% vs. 82%\n\n\nComparing interventions in 48hr vs. 24hr group\n\nTime from ROSC to start of TTM: 102 vs. 112min\nTime from ROSC to achievement of target temp: 281 vs. 320min, p=0.01\nInvasive cooling catheter: 65% vs. 59%\nTemp at 60 hours: 37.0 vs. 37.2, p=0.02\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nTTM to 33\u00b0C (+/-1\u00b0C) for 48hrs.\n\nBoth surface or invasive cooling methods allowed.\nTemperature measured according to local practices (bladder, oesophagus or intravascular)\nRewarming post period of TTM was to maximal rate of 0.5\u00b0C/hour\n\n\n\nControl\n\nTTM to 33\u00b0C (+/-1\u00b0C) for 24hrs\n\nOther specifics as for the intervention group\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nWith the exception of brain death, refractory shock or multiple organ failure, treatment centres agreed to provide active treatment until 72hrs after normothermia.\nFor patients who remained unconscious despite cessation of sedation, the attending physician chose modality(s) of neurological assessment to include a combination of imaging (CT, MRI) as well as EEG and/or somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP)\nDecisions to withdraw life support made according to local protocols\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nFavourable neurological outcome at 6 months based on Cerebral Performance Category scores \u2013 no significant difference\n\nA score of 1 (able to work and lead a normal life) or 2 (moderate cerebral disability but able to carry out part time work) was considered favourable.\nComparing intervention vs. control group:\n\n69% vs. 64%, difference 4.9% (95% C.I. -5 to 14.8), RR 1.08, p=0.33\nLack of significant effect was sustained across subgroups\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes, comparing intervention vs. control group\n\n6-month mortality \u2013 No significant difference.\n\n27% vs. 34%, difference -6.5% (95% C.I. -16.1 to 3.1), RR 0.81 p=0.19\n\n\nTime to death \u2013 No significant difference.\nOther outcomes\n\nAdverse events \u2013 Significantly higher in intervention group (97% vs. 91%, p=0.03)\n\nHypotension 62% vs. 49%, p=0.013\nNo significant difference in rates of pneumonia or bleeding between groups\n\n\nResource use\n\nVentilation time \u2013 significantly higher in the intervention group.\n\n120hrs V 87hrs (26% difference, 95% CI 16 to 36%, p = <0.001)\n\n\nICU length of stay was significantly higher in intervention group where as overall hospital stay was not significantly different between groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe authors conclude that this study did not show a difference for primary outcome, however they feel that their study may have had limited power to detect what may be a clinical important difference and suggest further research may be warranted.\n\nStrengths\n\nMulticentre randomised trial across ten hospitals\nObjective neurological assessment carried out by a blinded assessor\nThe primary outcome was highly relevant to patients (i.e based on functional outcome)\nProtocol was designed with the intention of being pragmatic.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe authors point out that because sample size was calculated using a 15% absolute difference, the risk of type 2 error is increased. A trial to elucidate if the 5% difference in primary outcome detected could be significant would require approximately 10-fold more patients.\n60% of all OOHCA all patients were excluded from this trial and an upper age limit of 80 years was placed for inclusion. This limits the external validity.\nThe study protocol was written before the TTM trial was published. A 3rd group with temperature maintained at 36C for 48 hours would have been useful\nIn both the intervention and the control groups, following completion of the targeted temperature management, ~50% of patients had a temperature of >37C. Therefore this study could not tell us if any differences reported were from prolonged therapeutic hypothermia or the avoidance of pyrexia.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac origin, this study reported that maintaining temperature at 33 degrees for 24 vs 48 hours resulted in no significant difference in neurologic outcome.\nIf we consider adverse outcomes and implications for distributions of resources, these results may also point toward possible disadvantages to cooling for more than 24 hours.\nMy current practice is to use targeted temperature management to a target of 36C for 30 hours followed by avoidance of pyrexia for 24-48 hours. Based on this study I will not change this practice.\nHopefully the outcome of TTM2 will help shed some further light on best evidence based practice in this area\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Targeted Temperature Management for 48 vs 24 Hours and Neurologic Outcome After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Randomized Clinical Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0European Resuscitation Council and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine Guidelines for Post-resuscitation Care 2015\n[further reading]\u00a0LITFL: Cardiac Arrest Literature Summaries\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Aoife Abbey @whistlingdixie4\nSummary date: July 30th 2017\nPeer-review editor:@davidslessor\n\n\n"
