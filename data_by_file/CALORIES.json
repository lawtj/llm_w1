NEJM 2014; 371:1673-1684 doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1409860\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients, does parenteral nutrition compared with enteral nutrition improve mortality?\n\nDesign\n\nOpen, multi-centre, parallel-group, randomised control trial\nIntention to treat analysis\nPatients assigned to enteral or parenteral nutrition using a telephone randomisation system in a 1:1 ratio\n\nAllocation balanced by ICU, age, surgical status, and presence/absence of severe malnutrition\n\n\n90% powered to detect an absolute risk reduction in 30 day mortality of 6.4%\n\ncalculated 2400 patients required\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n33 adult general ICUs in England\nData collected between June 2011 and March 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adults >18 years of age; expected to require nutritional support for > 2 days, starting within 36 hours of admission\nExclusion: Not suitable for either enteral or parenteral nutrition; received nutritional support in last 7 days; presence of gastrostomy/jejunostomy; pregnancy\n2400 adult patients with unplanned admissions to ICU\n\nIntervention\n\nParenteral nutrition via a dedicated lumen of a central venous catheter\n\nControl\n\nEnteral nutrition via a nasogastric or nasojejunal tube\n\nIn both groups, nutrition product used was determined by pre-existing local practice. Energy targets were 25kcal/kg/day in both groups, with the aim of reaching target within 48-72 hours. Nutrition was initiated within 36 hours of admission, and continued exclusively for 5 days unless: the patient was transitioned to exclusive oral feeding, was discharged from ICU or died\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: All-cause mortality at 30 days. No significant difference\n\n33.1% parenteral group vs. 34.2% enteral group\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nEpisodes of vomiting and \u201cclinically significant\u201d hypoglycaemia were greater in the enteral feeding group. \u201cSerious\u201d hypoglycaemia was not different (0.4% vs 0.3%)\nNo statistical difference in the 16 other secondary outcome measures, including:\n\nDuration of organ support\nSOFA scores\nTreated infectious and non-infectious complications (including aspiration events or pneumonia)\nICU and hospital length of stay\nThe duration of survival, and mortality at the time of discharge from the ICU, from the hospital and at 90 days\n\n\n\n\nSerious adverse effects were low and similar in both groups (no p values)\n\nregurgitation or aspiration (0.2% in parenteral group vs 0.3% in enteral group)\npneumothorax (0.1% in both groups)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nEarly nutritional support through the parenteral route is neither more harmful nor more beneficial than such support through the enteral route\n\nStrengths\n\nHigh quality RCT \u2013 reported in line with CONSORT criteria\nEligibility criteria defined appropriate to the population\nRandomisation with minimisation to control for sensible key variables\nBaseline characteristics were well matched with minimal exclusion criteria, meaning that results are applicable to a large percentage of the ICU population\nIncluded calories from non-nutritional sources (e.g propofol) in calculations of total calories\nMinimal loss to follow up\nOverall mortality is a feasible percentage for ICU population\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNot blinded \u2013 but this is was pragmatic trial and the primary endpoint is not subject to significant bias\nCrossover occurred in 6.8% in parenteral group and 3.4% in enteral group\nCaloric targets were not met in the majority of patients in either group, although the total caloric intake was similar (21.3 kcal/kg in parenteral group vs 18.5 kcal/kg in the enteral group). One of the potential advantages of parenteral feeding has been the effective delivery of calorific requirements particularly when early enteral feed cannot be established. If this cannot be achieved in a trial setting, then it is unlikely to be occurring in the context of our daily practice\n\nNon-protocolised selection of nutrition products, monitoring, and titration, reflecting the variety of practice at each participating site. This is not a weakness in the study design as it needed to be generalisable and applicable to the participating ICU\u2019s.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nEarly nutritional support through the parenteral route is neither more harmful nor more beneficial than through the enteral route. Enteral feeding does increase episodes of vomiting and hypoglycaemia but with no evidence of harm or nosocomial infection.\nDaily calorific targets were rarely achieved in this study (< 40% in both groups). This reflects a possible deficiency in our feeding protocols and adherence within UK and highlights the need for this to be addressed.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[abstract] Trial of the Route of Early Nutritional Support in Critically Ill Adults\n[review]\u00a0Total parenteral nutrition vs enteral nutrition: no difference in critically ill?
