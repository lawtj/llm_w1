Journal of Clinical Anesthesia 2010;22:164-168. doi:10.1016/j.jclinane.2009.05.006\nClinical Question\n\nIn obese patients with simulated difficult laryngoscopy, does the use of nasal oxygen prolong the duration that oxygen saturations remain \u226595%?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nNon-blinded\nAllocation concealment maintained\nPower calculation: To detect a difference of\u00a0\u226560 seconds, 30 patients would be required with a\n\nprobability of false positive trial 5%\nprobability of false negative trial 20%\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nSingle university hospital, USA\nDates of data collection not reported\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: elective surgery with general anaesthesia, BMI 30-35\nExclusion: female, smoker, cardiac/respiratory disease, reflux, raised intracranial pressure,\u00a0SpO2 \u2264 97% on 100% via face mask,\u00a0Grade 3 or 4 mask ventilation or laryngoscopic view (current or past)\n30 patients analysed out of 33 randomised\n\nIntervention\n\n5L/min O2 via nasal prongs\napplied prior to pre-oxygenation and continued until post-intubation\n\nControl\n\nNo O2 via nasal prongs\n\nAll patients in intervention and control groups\n\nhad standardised induction technique\nhad pre-oxygenation with\u00a0head up 25\u00b0 and at least 8 vital capacity breaths until end-tidal O2 % was >90%\nat 60 seconds had laryngoscopy performed\n\nIf Cormack and Lehane grade 3 or 4 then excluded from study\nIf Cormack and Lehane grade 1 or 2 then force on laryngoscope blade reduced to simulate a grade 4 view. At 6 minutes, or when SpO2 decreased to 95%, tracheal intubation was performed\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nPatients not given nasal O2 had a significantly shorter duration of time that\u00a0SpO2 was \u226595%\u00a0compared to patients who received nasal oxygen\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nThe number of patients with SpO2 \u226595% at 6 minutes was significantly greater in patients receiving nasal O2\nThe lowest SpO2 recorded was significantly lower in patients who did not receive nasal O2\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nNasal oxygen significantly increased the duration of SpO2 \u226595% during simulated difficult laryngoscopy in obese patients\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised\nMaintained allocation concealment\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle centre\nSmall sample size\nNon-blinded\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe addition of nasal oxygen from pre-oxygenation until post-intubation significantly prolonged the duration that oxygen saturations remained \u00a0\u226595% in simulated difficult airways. There are some methodological limitations, in particular the lack of blinding. However, as those treated with nasal oxygen had such significant gains and the treatment has minimal side effects,\u00a0this will become my standard practice for critically ill patients. If during RSI you have an episode of hypoxia and you have not applied nasal O2 the question should be asked as to why not.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0Apneic oxygenation during prolonged laryngoscopy in obese patients: a randomized, controlled trial of nasal oxygen administration\n[further reading]\u00a0St. Emelyns Best Bet apneic oxygenation during endotracheal intubation\n[further reading]\u00a0EMCrit: Preoxygenation, Reoxygenation and Deoxygenation\n[further reading]\u00a0Difficult Airway Society Proposed Guideline 2015 including the use of apneic oxygenation\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date: 23rd October 2014\nPeer-review editor: @stevemathieu75\n\n\n"
