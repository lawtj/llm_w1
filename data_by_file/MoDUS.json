Lancet Respir Med 2017; 5: 727. doi:10.1016/S2213-2600(17)30234-5\nClinical Question\n\nIn mechanically ventilated patients, does the early administration of simvastatin compared to placebo reduce the incidence of brain dysfunction (delirium and / or coma)?\n\nBackground\n\nDelirium has been defined as a clinical syndrome of acute brain dysfunction\nIt is common, with up to 80% of critically ill and mechanically ventilated patients suffering from delirium during their hospital stay, and it is associated with increased resource use and worse patient-related outcomes\nNo pharmacological agent has been shown to be effective at preventing or reducing delirium, although many are administered to control hyperactive delirium when it prevents the delivery of care \u2013 haloperidol, olanzapine, midazolam, clonidine, propofol, opioids to name just a few\nThe high concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines within CSF samples during critical illness has led to the postulation that anti-inflammatory drugs such as statins may reduce cognitive dysfunction \u2013 a theory supported by animal experiments and human observational studies\n\nDesign\n\nSingle-centre, randomised, controlled trial\nRandomisation sequence was generated in advance by a trial statistician\n\n1:1 allocation\nVariable block sizes of 2, 4, 6 and 8 without stratification for any known variables\n\n\nSequential and identical drug packs were prepared by an offsite, independent pharmaceutical using the randomisation sequence, such that allocation was concealed adequately\nPlacebo and active drug were identical, such that healthcare professionals and patients were blinded to allocation, but trial statisticians were aware of allocation\nPower calculation based upon data from ABC trial and BRAIN-ICU trial\n\nPowered to detect difference of 2 delirium-free and coma-free days (between day 0 and 14)\nSignificance defined as 0.05 (5% chance of false positive conclusion)\nPower set at 80% (20% chance of false negative conclusion)\nAllowing for 10% loss to follow-up, target sample size was 142\n\n\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nTrial design and statistical plan was published in advance\nThe trial was granted ethical approval by a national research ethics committee and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)\nNo funding came from corporate sponsors or pharmaceutical firms\nClinical definitions for outcomes were well validated assessment tools\n\nComa was defined as Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale score -3 to -5, assessed 4-hourly\nDelirium was defined as CAM-ICU positive (or Not Able To Assess if coma present), assessed twice per 12 hour nursing shift\nAny one positive assessment for coma or delirium classified that calendar day as not coma-free or delirium-free\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre, UK NHS hospital\nFebruary 2013 to July 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: invasive mechanical ventilation within first 72 hours of Critical Care admission\nExclusion: under 18 years old; pregnancy or breast-feeding; allergy to statin; recent administration of statins; clinical indication for statins; co-medication with interacting drug; severe deranged liver or renal disease; predicted short stay or routine post-operative care\n1164 screened, 142 randomised and included in the primary outcome analysis\nThe two groups were comparably similar in all measured variables (Simvastatin vs Placebo)\n\nMean age: 62 years vs 62 years\nSepsis, ARDS or both: 32% vs 25%\nMean SOFA score: 8.8 vs 8.9\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nSimvastatin\n\n80mg Simvastatin daily\nAdministered as soon as possible after randomisation, and midday each day thereafter\nAdministered via oral or nasogastric route\nMean days on drug: 7.9 (SD 6.6)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\nNo details of placebo ingredients\nAdministered as soon as possible after randomisation, and midday each day thereafter\nAdministered via oral or nasogastric route\nMean days on drug: 10.1 (SD 7.8)\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nDiscontinuation of the study drug occurred in any of the following situations\n\nICU discharge (54%)\nWithdrawal of life-supporting treatment (15%)\nCK > 10x upper limit of normal (8%)\n\n8 cases in Simvastatin group vs 3 cases in Placebo group (P = 0.21)\n\n\nDay 28 in trial on ICU (7%)\nDeath (6%)\n\nThese were censored as 0 days delirium-free to avoid a \u2018delirium-free death\u2019 being analysed as a good outcome\n\n\nDiscontinuation requested by clinician, patient or legal representative (6%)\nALT > 8x upper limit of normal (4%)\nSpecific indication for, or contraindication against, statin therapy (0%)\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: There was no statistical or clinically meaningful difference in the delirium-free and coma-free days between the two groups\n\nSimvastatin group: mean 5.7 days\nPlacebo group: mean 6.1 days\nMean difference: 0.4 days (95% CI -1.3 to 2.1)\nP = 0.66 (unpaired 2 sample t test)\n\nGiven the non-normal distribution, analyses using bootstrapping and joint modelling were conducted, which agreed with the crude t test analysis\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome: None of the following secondary outcome demonstrated any statistical or clinically meaningful difference\n\nDelirium-free and coma-free days to Day 28\nIncidence of any delirium (Simvastatin 93% vs Placebo 94%)\nVentilator-free days to Day 28\nOrgan-failure-free days to Day 28\nAll-cause mortality at 6 months (Simvastatin 42% vs Placebo 31%)\nMedian length of hospital stay (Simvastatin 16 days vs Placebo 18 days)\nIQCODE difference from baseline to 6 months (a measure of cognitive decline)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nEarly administration of simvastatin to a cohort of critically ill patients that required invasive mechanical ventilation did not decrease the number of days these patients were free from coma or delirium\n\nStrengths\n\nWell constructed experimental Phase 2 trial\nGood internal validity of the results\n\nAppropriate randomisation method, concealment of allocation, blinding and maintenance, which all minimise potential bias\nNo imbalance in baseline variables\nUse of validated assessment tools by blinded nursing staff\nAppropriate statistical analysis including intention-to-treat and complete follow-up for the primary outcome\nRecruited target number of patients, such that power calculation likely to be valid (i.e. 20% chance of false negative conclusion)\n\n\nReasonable potential to generalise results to other populations, but see comment in weaknesses\n\nInclusion / exclusion aimed to identify cohort at high-risk of developing delirium\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nLimitations to how the results can be extrapolated to other populations\n\nNon-English speaking patients excluded due to difficulty obtaining informed consent, such that cohort is probably dominated by white caucasian (but ethnicity not reported)\nThose with renal / liver disease were excluded\nSingle-centre design, so findings may not be reproduced if tested in other settings\n\n\n(In my opinion) The biological plausibility is doubtful and the short duration of therapy and follow-up weakens the conclusion\n\nAlthough administered as early as possible in this trial, it would seem unlikely that the inflammatory trigger (which may be a contributory factor in the cognitive dysfunction) can be modulated by a once daily dose of simvastatin administered after the critical illness has become established\nGiven the relatively short duration of administration (mean ~ 8 days), it may be that insufficient therapy was delivered to have clinically meaningful response\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis well designed and conducted trial demonstrates that there is no benefit from administering 80mg simvastatin with the first few days of a severe critical illness to prevent or treat early delirium\nDespite the strengths of the methodology, the doubtful plausibility of the hypothesis tested and the short duration of therapy means this trial may not have truly proven the theory is wrong, and further studies with different regimes or in different populations may be warranted\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Evaluation of early administration of simvastatin in the prevention and treatment of delirium in critically ill patients
