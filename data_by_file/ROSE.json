NEJM 2019; 380: 1997-2008. doi:\u00a010.1056/NEJMoa1901686\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with moderate to severe ARDS, does a strategy of early neuromuscular blockade with heavy sedation, as opposed to usual care with lighter sedation targets, result in a lower 90 day mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nThe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a syndrome with high morbidity and mortality\nNeuromuscular blockade is proposed to help the management of these patients by promoting ventilator synchrony, reducing work of breathing and reducing alveolar fluid accumulation, but may come at the cost of acquired weakness\nThe ACURASYS trial performed in 2010 showed a statistically significant reduction in mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS treated with cisatracurium, compared with deeply sedated control patients, albeit after an adjusted analysis of the primary end point\nNeuromuscular blockade has been weakly recommended in the management of ARDS, and uptake by clinicians has been variable\nThe management of critically ill patients has altered over the past decade, and deep sedation is no longer routine current practice\nWith so many questions remaining, the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung injury (PETAL) group designed a phase III trial\n\nDesign\n\nMulticentre, unblinded randomised control trial\nPermutational block design stratified by site, assigning patients in 1:1 ratio\nFor 90% power with two sided alpha 0.05, 1408 patients required (based on control group mortality 35% and intervention group 27%)\nIntention to treat analysis\nNo stopping rule for futility\nDesigned to be stopped for superiority using symmetrical group sequential stopping boundaries\nWald test for proportions used to compare primary outcomes between groups\nRisk difference scales used to compare secondary outcomes\nWeighted Poisson regression used to compare adverse events\n\nSetting\n\n48 ICUs in the United States\nJan 2016-April 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nP/F ratio <150 mmHg (22 kPa)\nPEEP>8 cm H2O\nBilateral opacities on CXR/CT that could not be explained by effusions, pulmonary collapse, or nodules\nRespiratory failure that could not be explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload\nOnset of illness within one week of known clinical insult or new/worsening respiratory symptoms\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nRefusal of consent\nNeuromuscular blockade at prior to enrolment\nPregnant\nECMO at time of assessment\nChronic respiratory failure (defined as pCO2 >8 kPa in outpatients)\nHome ventilation\nBMI >100\nSevere chronic liver disease\nBone marrow transplant within last year\nExpected mandatory ventilation duration <48 hours\nDecision to withhold life-sustaining therapy\nMoribund and not expected to survive 24 hours\nDiffuse alveolar haemorrhage from vasculitis\n>70% BSA Burns\nUnwillingness/unable to stick to ARDSnet 6mL/kg protocol\nHypersensitivity to cisatracurium\nNeuromuscular conditions that may potentiate NMB/inhibit spontaneous ventilation\nNeurological conditions undergoing treatment for intracranial hypertension\nEnrolment in an interventional ARDS trial with direct impact on neuromuscular blockade/PEEP\nP/F ratio >200 mmHg (32 kPa) after meeting inclusion criteria and before randomisation\nVentilation >5 days\nOn lung transplant list\n\n\n4848 patients screened, 1006 patients included in primary analysis\nPatient demographics very similar between groups, except shock, at baseline\n\nIntervention\n\nDeep sedation within four hours of randomisation\n15 mg bolus of cisatracurium, followed by 37.5 mg/h infusion\n\nControl\n\nLight sedation defined by\n\nRASS 0 to -1\nRiker sedation scale 3-4\nRamsay sedation score 2-3\n\n\nInstitutions were allowed to use their normal sedation scoring modality\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nLow tidal volume ventilation within two hours of randomisation, with high PEEP for up to five days\nLower PEEP was allowed for\n\nHypoxia\nHypotension\nPplat>30\nAcidosis (pH <7.15) despite reducing tidal volumes, fluid boluses, or increasing respiratory rate\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: In-hospital death from any cause at 90 days\n\n42.5% (intervention) vs 42.8% (control)\nBetween group difference -0.3% (95% CI -6.4 to 5.0)\nP value 0.93\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nNo significant difference seen in any secondary outcomes except for serious cardiovascular effects\n\n14 (intervention) vs 4 (control)\nP value = 0.02\n\n\nOther pre-specified secondary outcomes were\n\nICU acquired weakness\nPlasma IL-6 concentration (removed at final analysis)\n28-day mortality\nVentilator-free days at day 28\nOrgan failure-free days till day 28\nICU-free days at day 28\nHospital-free days at day 28\nPhysiologic measures\nLong term assessments of quality of life\nUse of rescue procedures e.g ECMO\nAwareness/recall\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\u201cAmong patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS who were treated with a strategy involving a high PEEP, there was no significant difference in mortality at 90 days between patients who received an early and continuous cisatracurium infusion and those who were treated with a usual-care approach with lighter sedation targets\u201d\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised\nIntention to treat analysis\nRegistered at clinicaltrials.gov\nHigh compliance with study protocols\nLarge cohort\nUse of high PEEP and lighter sedation targets in the control arm more closely reflect current clinical practice\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnblinded\nLarge loss of patients at screening- the largest reasons for exclusion were patients improving between screening and inclusion (658) and patients having already received neuromuscular blockade (655)\nThe 655 patients who received neuromuscular blockade, and thus were excluded from the trial, may have biased the results in favour of the control group\nDepth of neuromuscular blockade not measured- the authors make a strong case for the weakness of traditional \u201ctrain-of-four\u201d measurements, however it could be argued that this was not a standard of care\nStopped for futility, in the absence of a pre-specified stopping rule- this was decided by a steering committee independent of the authors; however this renders ROSE an underpowered study\nThe use of rescue therapies, in particularly proning, was not standardised\n\nIn ACURASYS, 50% of patients were proned, as opposed to 16% in this study\nProning has been shown to improve mortality- that may have affected the results of both ACURASYS and this trial\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn this trial, deep sedation combined with an infusion of cisatracurium did not improve 90-day mortality when compared with a light sedation strategy in a cohort of\u00a0patients recruited early in the course of\u00a0moderate-to-severe ARDS\nThis does not change my practice of using neuromuscular blockade in selected patients to improve ventilator synchrony\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Early Neuromuscular Blockade in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n[Editorial] Early paralytic agents for ARDS?
