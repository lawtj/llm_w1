DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2024922\nClinical Question\n\nIn mechanically ventilated adults with sepsis, does\u00a0the use of dexmedetomidine, compared with propofol, for continuous sedation\u00a0improve the number of days alive without delirium or coma?\n\nBackground\n\nWorldwide we treat around 20 million patients a year with sepsis complicated by severe organ dysfunction, of whom around 20% are mechanically ventilated\nSedation is frequently administered for patient comfort but is associated with short-term and long-term effects. Expanding areas of interest include the prevention of cognitive and functional impairment, and quality of life after critical illness\nDexmedetomidine is an alpha2 receptor agonist that causes sedation and may promote biomimetic sleep. Additional putative mechanisms that make it an attractive agent in sepsis include anti-inflammatory and bacterial clearance properties\nThe MENDS trial showed that the use of dexmedetomidine resulted in more days alive without delirium or coma compared with lorazepam. An a priori-designed analysis of the MENDS trial investigating the subgroup of patients with sepsis found that these effects were more pronounced and that dexmedetomidine was associated with a reduction in 28 day mortality\nHowever, several studies have identified benzodiazepines as an independent risk factor for the development of delirium and time spent receiving mechanical ventilation, so this may not be the most useful comparator. A head to head study demonstrated non-inferiority of dexmedetomidine compared to propofol with regards to maintaining light to moderate sedation and patients receiving dexmedetomidine were more interactive\nWhen considering the dosing regime in this trial it is worth mentioning the secular trend towards reducing sedation doses administered in ICU as studies have demonstrated the impact this has on the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay\n\nDesign\n\nDouble-blind (with the exception of bedside nurses), multi-centre, investigator initiated, randomised controlled trial\nRandomisation in a 1:1 ratio to receive either dexmedetomidine or propofol using computer-generated permuted blocks\nStratification by enrolment site and age (<65 years vs \u226565 years)\nThe trial protocol was amended due to slow enrolment such that the enrolment target was reduced from 530 patients to 420 patients receiving the trial drug to provide 85% power to detect a 1.5-day difference in days alive without delirium or coma and 80% power to detect a 12% absolute difference in mortality at 90 days, assuming an expected mortality of 30% in the control group\nModified intention-to-treat analysis (patients who were randomised and received trial drug)\nTrial registered at ClinicalTrials.gov\n\nSetting\n\n438 patients were recruited in 13 medical centres in the United States between May 2013 and December 2018, of whom 422 began receiving dexmedetomidine (214 patients) or propofol (208 patients) as some patients were subsequently found to be ineligible\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adults who were sequentially admitted to a medical or surgical ICU, had suspected or known infection, and were treated with continuous sedation for invasive mechanical ventilation\nExclusion: The main exclusion criteria were as follows:\n\nBaseline severe cognitive impairment\nPregnancy or breast-feeding\nSecond-degree or third-degree heart block, persistent bradycardia requiring intervention\nIndication for benzodiazepines\nAnticipated to have immediate discontinuation of mechanical ventilation\nMoribund state\nHad received mechanical ventilation for more than 96 hours\n\n\nBaseline demographics (dexmedetomidine vs propofol)\n\nMedian age: 59 vs 60 years\nFemale sex: 43% vs 42%\nMedian Charlson Comorbidities Index score: 2 vs 2\nMedian APACHE II score at ICU admission: 27 vs 27\nMedian days from mechanical ventilation before trial enrolment: 0.98 vs 0.97\nVasopressor treatment at enrolment: 56% vs 49%\nInfection status:\n\nConfirmed by culture: 68% vs 63%\nSuspected but not confirmed by culture: 27% vs 33%\nRuled out: 5% vs 4%\n\n\nDexmedetomidine before enrolment: 15% vs 12%\nPropofol before enrolment: 61% vs 62%\nDelirium at enrolment: 35% vs 44%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nDexmedetomidine\n\nInfusion (5 mcg/ml) titrated according to a weight-based dosing guideline (0.15-1.5 mcg per kilogram of actual body weight per hour)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPropofol \n\nInfusion (10 mg/ml) titrated according to a weight-based dosing guideline (5-50 mcg per kilogram of actual body weight per minute)\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nPharmacists prepared the trial drugs in identical intravenous fluid bags covered with opaque bags and bedside nurses covered tubing with opaque coverings and begun infusing at a dose corresponding to the sedative dosing that the patient was receiving immediately before randomisation\nProtocolised titration of trial drug using a weight-based dosing guideline every 10 minutes to target sedation goals according to the Richmond Agitation\u2013Sedation Scale (RASS) target set by the clinical team, primarily to a light sedation target (RASS 0 to -2)\nProtocolised temporary holding and permanent discontinuation criteria\nProtocolised rescue protocol for pain, rescue sedation, chemical paralysis or hyperactive delirium\nAll centres performed, and investigators reinforced, the ABCDE bundle\n\nOutcome\n\nTrial interventions (dexmedetomidine vs propofol):\n\nMedian daily dose on days administered (IQR): 0.27 mcg/kg/hr (0.11-0.61) vs 10.2 mcg/kg/min (5.5-18.4)\nTrial or clinical team aware of the drug used: 13% vs 15%\nWithdrawal from trial during hospitalisation: 5% vs 4%\nMedian RASS score while receiving drug (IQR): -2.00 (-3.00 to -1.00) vs -1.95 (-3.03 to -0.98)\nPercent time at target sedation level while receiving drug: 57% vs 60%\nPercent of days with adherence to ABCDE bundle:\n\nSpontaneous awakening trial: 98% vs 98%\nSpontaneous breathing trial: 93% vs 95%\nCoordination of awakening and breathing trials: 86% vs 84%\nNon-drug delirium interventions:  99% vs 99%\nEarly mobilisation: 91% vs 92%\n\n\n\u00a0Median daily fentanyl dose on days administered (IQR): 68mcg/hr (28-119) vs 56mcg/hr (20-95)\nMidazolam ever used: 53% vs 43%\nMedian daily midazolam dose on days administered (IQR): 3.8mg/day (2.0-10.9) vs 4.0mg/day (2.0-10.8)\nAntipsychotics ever used: 42% vs 42%\nOpen-label propofol every used: 13% vs 8%\nOpen-label dexmedetomidine ever used: 4% vs 3%\n\n\nPrimary efficacy endpoint: Adjusted number of days alive without delirium or coma over the 14-day intervention period was not significantly different between the dexmedetomidine and propofol groups\n\n10.7 days vs 10.8 days (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.26)\n\n\nSecondary efficacy endpoints: There were no significant differences in the number of ventilator-free days (VFD) at 28 days, death at 90 days or global cognition at 6 months between the dexmedetomidine and propofol groups\n\nVFD at 28 days: Adjusted median 23.7 vs 24.0 days (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.51)\nDeath at 90 days: 38% vs 39% (HR 1.06; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.52\nGlobal cognition at 6 months assessed with an age-adjusted Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status total score (TICS-T): 40.9 vs. 41.4 (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.33)\n\nOverall around 25% in each group had age-adjusted TICS-T scores that were 2 standard deviations below population norms, suggesting clinically important cognitive dysfunction\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Safety endpoints:\u00a0\n\nThere were no significant differences in any organ dysfunction during the 14-day study treatment between the dexmedetomidine and propofol groups\n1 patient had suspected propofol-related infusion syndrome \u2013 later disproved\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\u201cAmong critically ill adults with sepsis who were receiving mechanical ventilation and for whom recommended light-sedation approaches were used, dexmedetomidine did not lead to better outcomes than propofol with respect to days alive without acute brain dysfunction, ventilator-free days, death at 90 days, or cognition at 6 months.\u201d\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre, randomised, controlled trial\nA relevant clinical question given the position of equipoise between the study drugs and a logical extension of the MENDS trial where the sepsis subgroup appeared to benefit from dexmedetomidine\u00a0\u00a0\nRandomisation technique with computer-generated permuted blocks ensured allocation concealment\nWell designed study with the use of protocolised titration and rescue using validated tools such as RASS, as well as temporary holding and permanent discontinuation criteria\u00a0\nExcellent adherence to the ABCDE bundle, which was reinforced throughout the study\nBaseline demographics were generally well matched\nAll patients were included in the modified intention to treat analysis for the primary outcome with minimal imputation for missing data\nOutcome measures placed emphasis on short-term and long-term cognitive outcomes as well as long-term functional and quality of life outcomes. Long-term data was captured in over 90% of survivors at 6 months\nAnother study demonstrating the safety of dexmedetomidine, given earlier concerns about cardiovascular risk in particular\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAlthough the authors did a commendable job at blinding it was not feasible to blind the trial drugs to bedside nurses, which could have introduced bias, although not obviously in any one direction\nUnmasking of the trial drug occurred in 14% of patients, which could have introduced bias, although not obviously in any one direction\nThere was a higher incidence of delirium at enrolment in the propofol group, which may bias away from the null\nOver 90% of eligible patients were excluded with a notable proportion due to physicians or relatives declining participation, limiting external validity and hinting at a loss of equipoise\nSlow enrolment over a number of years is susceptible to secular trend and also necessitated an adjustment to the sample size, although statistical power was maintained\nThe doses of trial drugs administered were relatively low and there was a frequent need for rescue sedatives. The use of an analgesic, fentanyl, as a first line rescue sedative may be considered controversial\u00a0\nThere was some contamination between groups, particularly off-label use of propofol in the dexmedetomidine group during the study, although the doses used were low\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDespite its excellent design, the validity of this study was limited by the low doses of trial drugs administered and use of rescue analgesics and sedatives\nClinically important cognitive dysfunction occurred in approximately 25% of patients in both groups at 6 months\nUltimately this trial supports a position of equipoise between dexmedetomidine and propofol for use in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis requiring continuous sedation\n\nExternal Links\n\nAbstract: Dexmedetomidine or Propofol for Sedation in Mechanically Ventilated Adults with Sepsis\nFurther reading: The MENDS2 Trial: Dexmedetomidine vs Propofol for Sedation\nFurther reading: PulmCrit Wee \u2013 MENDS2: Fentanyl or fentanyl for sedation in mechanically ventilated adults with sepsis\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Andrew Achilleos\nSummary date: April 22, 2021\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
