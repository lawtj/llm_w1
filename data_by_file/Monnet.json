Critical Care Med. 2012; 40:152-157\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients who are mechanically ventilated, does\u00a0the tidal volumes or compliance, affect the performance of pulse pressure variation to predict volume responsiveness? In addition, in patients with ARDS can a passive leg raise test or end-expiratory occlusion test predict fluid responsiveness?\n\nDesign\n\nProspective observational study\nBlinding not stated\nUse of consecutive patients not stated\nStatistics\n\nData pre + post fluid challenge compared using paired Student t test or Wilcoxon paired test, as appropriate\nComparison of data between different groups performed using two-sample Student t test or a Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate\nComparison of ROC curves tested with Hanley-McNeil test\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nSingle medical ICU, Paris\nDates of data collection not stated\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria: Mechanically ventilated patients with circulatory failure who required a fluid challenge\n\nCirculatory failure:\n\nBP \u226490mmHg (or decrease of \u226550 in known hypertensive)\nAnd at least 1 of the following\n\nUrinary flow \u22640.5ml/kg/min for \u22652 hours\nHR \u2265100\nSkin mottling\n\n\n\n\nNeed for fluid challenge as determined by attending physician\nMechanical ventilation in assist control mode\nAbsence of cardiac arrhythmias and spontaneous triggering of ventilator, as assessed by 2 investigators using airway pressure curve\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n<18 years\nMoribund\nPassive leg raise contraindicated (head trauma, venous compression stocking)\n\n\nAll patients sedated, and 5 patients paralysed\n54 patient included\n\n44 septic patients\n27 patients had ARDS, Compliance was 22ml/cmH20 in these patients\n27 patients did not have ARDS, Compliance was 45ml/cmH2O in these patients\n\n\n\nTests of Interest\n\nPulse pressure variation (PPV)\n\nMeasured pre and post-fluid challenge\n\n\nPassive leg raise (PLR)\n\nPatient transferred from 45\u00b0 semirecumbent position to supine with legs raised to\u00a045\u00b0\nCardiac output studies recorded when changes induced by PLR were maximal i.e. within 1 minute\n\n\nEnd-expiratory occlusion (EEO)\n\nEnd-expiratory hold for 15 seconds\nCardiac output studies recorded at end of EEO\n\n\n\nFor both PLR and EEO,\u00a0baseline cardiac output measurements performed at baseline and 1 minute post test of interest.\nGold Standard Investigation\n\nFluid challenge\n\nFollowing PLR and EEO tests, patient given 500ml normal saline over 20 minutes\n\n\n\nIn all patients cardiac output studies performed using a PiCCO2 device. Measurements taken at baseline, post-test of interests and post-fluid challenge.\u00a0Volume responder defined as increase in Cardiac index (CI)\u00a0\u226515%\nOutcome\n\nVolume responders\n\nFluid challenge significantly increased CI \u226515% (+44% \u00b139%) in 30 \u2018volume responders\u2019\nIn patients with ARDS there were 16 responders and 11 non-responders\nIn patients without ARDS there were 14 responders and 13 non-responders\n\n\nPrimary outcome: Pulse pressure variation\n\nSignificantly correlated with compliance (r=0.55, p=0.0001)\nNot correlated with tidal volume (r=0.21, p=0.13)\nSignificantly higher in volume responders with compliance >30ml/cmH20 vs. \u226430ml/cmH20 (18% vs. 8%). Whereas in non-responders there was no significant difference\nAll patients that had\u00a0a PPV of >12% were found to be fluid responsive regardless of the compliance. The poor performance at predicting fluid responsiveness in patients with a low compliance was due to the false negative results.\n\n\n\nPassive Leg Raise\n\nChanges in CI induced by PLR not significantly correlated with compliance (r=-0.09) or with tidal volume (r=0.14)\nSignificant increase in CI induced by PLR in volume responders with both low and high compliance (28% and 24% respectively)\nIn non-volume responders no significant increase in CI with PLR\n\nEnd-expiratory occlusion\n\nChanges in CI induced by EEO signficantly correleated with compliance\nSignificant increase in CI induced by EEO\u00a0in volume responders with both low and high compliance (9% and 10% respectively)\nIn non-volume responders no significant increase in CI with\u00a0EEO\n\n\n\u00a0\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nPulse pressure variation is less accurate at predicting fluid responsiveness in patients with\u00a0low compliance, but passive leg raising and End-Expiratory Occlusion test remain valuable in these circumstances.\n\nStrengths\n\nClear inclusion and exclusion criteria\nAnalysed for effects of both tidal volume and compliance\n3 tests of interest compared with results from fluid challenge\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNot stated if consecutive patients enrolled\nNo sample size calculation\nSingle centre\nAuthors on advisory board of Pulsion Medical Systems\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPulse pressure variation performed poorly at predicting fluid\u00a0responsiveness in patients with a low compliance, irrespective of lung volumes. This was due to to a high false negative rate.\nIncreases in cardiac index induced by passive leg raising and end-expiratory occlusion performed well at predicting\u00a0fluid responsiveness in patients with both a high and low compliance.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Passive leg-raising and end-expiratory occlusion tests perform better than pulse pressure variation in patients with low respiratory compliance\n[podcast]\u00a0EMCrit: fluid responsiveness\n[SMACC podcast via EmCrit]\u00a0Rob MacSweeney vs Paul Marik \u2013 Predicting Fluid Responsiveness is a Waste of Time\n[further reading] Will this haemodynamically unstable patient respond to a bolus of intravenous fluids?\n[further reading]\u00a0Predicting Fluid Responsiveness in Critically Ill Patients by Using Combined End-Expiratory and End-Inspiratory Occlusions With Echocardiography\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date: 27th April 2016\nPeer-review editor: @avkwong\n\n\n"
