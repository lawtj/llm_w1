N Engl J Med 2012;366:2055-64.\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with septic shock, does Activated Protein C (also known as drotrecogin alfa or DrotAA) compared with placebo reduce mortality?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised\nMulti-centre\nDouble blind\nPlacebo controlled\n6 month follow up period\nPowered at 80% with \u237a significance level of 0.05 to detect absolute mortality difference of 7% (relative difference 20%), from expected baseline mortality rate of 35%, if 1500 patients were recruited\n\nRecruitment target was increased mid-study to 1696 due to lower-than-expected mortality rate of 27.6%\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nMarch 2008 to August 2011\n208 sites worldwide (Europe, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand and India)\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion\n\nAge \u226518 years\nInfection requiring IV antibiotics\n\u22652 SIRS criteria\nSeptic shock, defined as:\n\nAt least 30 mL/kg IV fluids\n\u22651 vasopressor for \u22654h\nContinuing vasopressor requirements through time of randomization with goal SBP of 90 mmHg or MAP of 65 mmHg\n\n\nHypoperfusion in the prior 36 hours, defined as \u22651 of:\n\nMetabolic acidosis, defined as base deficit of at least 5 mmol/L, bicarbonate <18 mmol/L, lactate >2.5 mmol/L\nUrine output <0.5 mL/kg/h for an hour or a 50% increase of creatinine from baseline\n\n\nAcute hepatic dysfunction with AST or ALT >500 IU/dL or bilirubin >2 g/dL\n\n\n\n\nExclusion\n\nCoexisting illnesses with high risk of death (e.g. metastatic cancer)\n\n\n\n\n27816 potential patients, 1697 recruited and randomised\nMean APACHE II scores were 25.2 (DrotAA group) and 25.5 (placebo group)\n\nIntervention\n\nDrotAA 24mcg/kg of body weight per hour for 96 hours\n\nMean duration administered was 83.3 hours\nInterrupted for procedures in 36.7%\nStudy drug stopped early in 25.9%\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo dissolved in 0.9% saline solution at equivalent infusion rate\n\nMean duration administered was 85.1 hours\nInterrupted for procedures in 34.4%\nStudy drug stopped early in 22.9%\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: 28-day mortality\n\n26.4% in intervention vs 24.2% in control\nRelative risk 1.09 (95% CI 0.92-1.28; p = 0.31)\nAbsolute risk reduction -2.2 (95% CI -2.0-6.3; NNH = 47)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\n90-day mortality\n\n34.1% in intervention vs 32.7% in control\nRelative risk 1.04 (95% CI 0.90-1.19; p = 0.56)\nAbsolute risk reduction -1.36 (95% CI-3.17-5.89; NNH = 74)\n\n\nSOFA score at day 7\n\nNo difference:\n\nCardiovascular\nRespiratory\nRenal\nCoagulation\nLiver\n\n\n\n\nAdverse Events\n\nAny serious events by day 28\n\n14.3% in intervention vs 11.5% in control\nRelative risk 1.23 (95% CI 0.96-1.59; p = 0.11)\nAbsolute risk reduction -2.76 (95% CI -0.46-5.98; NNH = 37)\n\n\n\n\nAny bleeding event during treatment period\n\nNon-serious\n\n8.6% in intervention vs 4.8% in control\nRelative risk 1.80 (95% CI 1.23-2.61; p = 0.002)\nAbsolute risk reduction -3.84 (95% CI 1.44-6.24; NNH = 27)\n\n\nSerious\n\n1.2% in intervention vs 1.0% in control\nRelative risk 1.25 (95% CI 0.49-3.15; p = 0.81)\nAbsolute risk reduction -0.24 (95% CI -0.75-1.23; NNH = 417)\n\n\nAny cerebral haematoma, cerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, haemorrhagic stroke by day 28\n\n0.4% in intervention vs 0.4% in control\nRelative risk 1.00 (95% CI 0.20-4.90; p = 1.00)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nDrotAA did not significantly reduce mortality at 28 or 90 days, as compared with placebo, in patients with septic shock.\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised, blinded, placebo-controlled\nTargeted the group of patients identified by PROWESS as most likely to benefit i.e. the sickest patients\nAdaptive trial design: statistical power maintained by increasing recruitment numbers when mortality < 30%\n\nWeaknesses\n\nFunded by manufacturer\nEach centre recruited an average of 8.2 patients over the 3 years and 5 months period. This very low recruitment rate for severe sepsis (a not uncommon syndrome) is unexplained.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDrotAA doesn\u2019t reduce mortality in patients who are septic and you can no longer get it anyway \u2013 the drug has been withdrawn.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0Drotrecogin Alfa (Activated) in Adults with Septic Shock\n[Open access commentary] Severe sepsis: are PROWESS and PROWESS-SHOCK trials comparable?
