NEJM 2014;1-9. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1403285\nClinical Question\n\nIn mechanically ventilated adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), does simvastatin compared to placebo reduce ventilator dependence?\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-center, double-blind\nRandomised in a 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks and stratification according to study site and vasopressor requirement\nDesigned with 80% power to detect a difference of 2.6 ventilator-free days from a baseline of 12.7 (SD 10.6), with significance level of 0.05, if 524 patients were recruited\n\nAllowing for 3% withdrawal, planned to recruit 540 patients\n\n\nIntention-to-treat statistics\n\nSetting\n\n40 general ICUs in UK and Ireland\nDecember 2010 \u2013 March 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: mechanical ventilation + onset of ARDS within previous 48 hours (PaO2:FiO2 < 300 mmHg, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, no evidence of left atrial hypertension)\nExclusion: pregnancy, contraindications to statins, recent statin administration (within 2 weeks)\n5926 patients were screened and 540 were randomised\n\nIntervention\n\nEnteral simvastatin 80mg once daily for a maximum of 28 days\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo therapy at the same frequency and duration as the intervention group\n\n\nFor both groups, ventilation strategy was not defined, but low tidal volume ventilation with plateau pressures maintained below 30 cmH2O were encouraged.\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: there was a small but not statistically significant difference in the ventilator-free days to day 28 between the groups (given as mean\u00b1SD)\n\nsimvastatin group 12.6\u00b19.9 days vs placebo group 11.5\u00b110.4\nmean difference 1.1 days (95% CI -0.6 to 2.8; p=0.21)\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\noxygenation index: no significant difference\nSOFA score: no\u00a0significant \u00a0difference\ndays free of non-pulmonary organ failure to day 28: no\u00a0significant \u00a0difference\ndeath within 28 days: no\u00a0significant difference\ndeath before discharge from hospital: no\u00a0significant \u00a0difference\nsafety: significantly more adverse events in simvastatin group (raised CK and raised liver enzymes), but no difference in serious adverse events\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nSimvastatin therapy did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with ARDS\n\nStrengths\n\nBuilds upon carefully planned theoretical work, animal, in vitro and phase 1 clinical trials\nMulti-centre, pragmatic study design, allowing clinicians to treat as they normally did\nInclusive of all causes of ARDS (c.f. SAILS trial, that focused on sepsis)\nA priori publication of protocol and statistical plan\n\nWeaknesses\n\nStatistically significant difference\u00a0between groups\u00a0in baseline PaO2:FiO2 ratio, with simvastatin group having slightly worse ratios: 123 vs. 132.4 mmHg. This will bias toward null hypothesis. A post-hoc statistical adjustment was performed; the between-group difference remained statistically insignificant.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSimvastatin use in ARDS has no benefit, based upon these data.\nThis trial does demonstrate a good safety profile in the critically ill, although biochemical abnormalities are more likely with simvastatin.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0 Simvastatin in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n[further reading]\u00a0Future therapies for ARDS by Curley\n[further reading]\u00a0Statins in the Critically Ill by Life in the Fast Lane\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @SteveMathieu75 and @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 10 December 2014\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@davidslessor\n\n\n"
