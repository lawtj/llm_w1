NEJM 2015; 372:2398-2408. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1502826\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill adults, does restriction of non-protein calories (permissive underfeeding) compared to standard feeding reduce mortality at 90 days?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\nComputer-generated sealed opaque envelopes\nBlock randomisation with stratification according to medical centre\nNon-blinded intervention but with objective end-point\nClinician-led management of non-nutrition elements of care\nPowered at 80% to detect 8% absolute reduction in mortality from baseline of 25% with standard feeding if 892 patients recruited, allowing for 3% loss\n\nSetting\n\n7 hospitals across Saudi Arabia and Canada\nNovember 2009 to September 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Enteral feeding commenced within 48 hours of ICU admission; expected to stay in ICU \u2265 72 hours; age 18\u201380 years\nExclusion: use of total parenteral nutrition; high-dose vasopressors (e.g. noradrenaline > 0.4 \u00b5g/kg/min); palliation or condition with expected 6-month mortality \u2265 50%; post cardiac arrest; pregnancy; liver transplant; burns\n894 patients randomised (14% of screened patients)\n\nDemographic and physiological scores were similar between groups (intervention vs control as mean \u00b1 standard deviation)\n\nAge: 50.2\u00b119.5 vs 50.9\u00b119.4\nBMI: 29.0\u00b18.2 vs 29.7\u00b18.8\nMedical: 75% vs 75%\nSurgical: 4.2% vs 2.7%\nTrauma: 21% vs 22%\nAPACHE 2: 21.0\u00b17.9 vs 21.0\u00b18.2\nMechanical ventilation: 97% vs 97%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nPermissive underfeeding\n\nCaloric goal was 40\u201360% of caloric requirement\nProtein was supplemented with Beneprotein, Nestle Nutrition\nSupplemented fluid input with enteric 0.9% saline or water\nAverage caloric intake achieved was 835\u00b1297 kcal/day (46\u00b114% caloric goal)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard feeding\n\nCaloric goal was 70\u2013100% of caloric requirement\nAverage caloric intake achieved was 1299\u00b1467 kcal/day (71\u00b122% caloric goal)\n\n\n\n\u00a0Treatment common to both groups\n\nCaloric requirements calculated using\n\nPenn State equation 2003 if BMI < 30\nIreton-Jones equation 1992 if BMI \u2265 30 or spontaneously breathing\n\n\nProtein goal was 1.2\u20131.5g per kg body weight per day\nContinued for 14 days or until ICU discharge, oral feeding, death or palliation\nGlucose goal was 4.4\u201310 mmol/l (80\u2013180 mg/dl)\nEnteric multivitamins\nUnder or over feeding on one day was balanced by targeted over or underfeeding the next day, respectively\nCaloric intake calculations included propofol, intravenous dextrose and parenteral nutrition\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: there was no statistically significant difference in 90-day mortality\n\nPermissive underfeeding: 27.2%\nStandard feeding: 28.9%\nAbsolute risk reduction = 1.67% (95% CI -4.27 to 7.59%)\nRelative risk reduction = 0.94 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.16;
