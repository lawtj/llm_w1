NEJM 2013;368:2159-68.\nClinical Question\n\nDoes the early application of prone positioning improve mortality in severe ARDS?\n\nDesign\n\nRCT, computer generated, stratified by ICU\nBlinding of outcome assessors\n\nSetting\n\n27 centres in France and Spain, all with >5 years experience of proning\n01.01.2008. \u2013 25.07.2011.\n\nPopulation\n\nAdult patients with severe ARDS who were intubated/ventilated for <36 hours at inclusion\n\nPaO2:FiO2 <150mmHg (20Kpa) with FiO2 \u22650.6, PEEP \u22655, TV~6ml/kg, confirmed after 12-24 hours of ventilation\n\n\nExcluded if contraindication to proning\n474 patients randomised from 3449 patients with ARDS\n\nIntervention\n\nProne for at least 16 consecutive hours, for 28 days, or until improvement to set standard\n\nControl\n\nSupine (semi-recumbent position)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: all cause mortality at 28-days\n\n16% in prone vs. 32.8% in supine (P<0.001)\nadjusted odds ratio 0.42 (0.26-0.66)\n\n\nNo increase in adverse events in prone group\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nPatients with severe ARDS have improved mortality with early and long proning sessions\n\nStrengths\n\nStandardised ventilation and weaning strategy with use of PEEP-FiO2 table\nAppropriate power calculation\nIntention to treat analysis\n\nWeaknesses\n\n2015 patients not screened for inclusion in trial. ?selection bias\nDifferences in baseline characteristics. Comparing prone to supine group, at inclusion in the study:\n\nSOFA score 10.4 vs. 9.6\nUse of Vasopressors 83% vs. 72.6%\nUse of neuromuscular blockers 82.3% vs. 91%\n\n\nCentres all had >5 years with proning therefore results may not be generalisable to centres with limited experience\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nProning in severe ARDS reduces mortality without an increase in adverse outcomes. Further studies are required to confirm these findings but in the mean time these results are difficult to ignore.\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf / abstract / doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1214103\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\nNone listed\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DavidSlessor\nSummary date: 1 May 2014\nPeer-review editor:  @stevemathieu75\n\n\n\n"
