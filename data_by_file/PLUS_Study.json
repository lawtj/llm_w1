There was no difference in the primary outcome of proportion of patients with an acute kidney injury.\n\nAlthough not statistically significant, point estimates favoured Plasmalyte with regards to the secondary outcomes of RRT requirement and death in hospital\n\n\n\n\nThe repeated signals favouring balanced crystalloids have prompted investigators to conduct trials with adequate power.\n\nDesign\n\nInvestigator initiated, double-blind, parallel-group, randomised, controlled trial\nBlock randomisation with variable block sizes\n\nRandomisation conducted via secure website\n\n\nStudy treatments supplied in identical 1000ml bags that were macroscopically indistinguishable\nData collected daily for first 7 days included haemodynamic variables, urine output, organ support, laboratory data and volume of fluids administered, data collected daily through to day 90 included ventilations and RRT status, creatinine levels and volume of trial fluid administered\nPatients followed up for 6 months post randomisation\nAnalysed on intention to treat basis\nAnalysis was unadjusted, adjusted, adjusted by multiple imputation for missing data and a post-hoc inverse-probability-weighting analysis of the primary outcome to account for patients in the BMES group who received open-label saline after randomization was conducted\nPredefined subgroups (AKI, APACHE II score and post-surgical admission) and sensitivity analyses in addition to planned cost-effectiveness analysis\nPower calculation\n\n8800 required with 90% power to detect a 2.9% absolute reduction in 90 day mortality at an alpha of 0.05 (assumed 23% mortality in control group) with a ~2% loss to follow up\n\nBased on SPLIT (risk reduction) and NICE SUGAR (mortality rate with a 2% reduction for improvement in mortality since 2008)\n\n\nCOVID-19 disrupted recruitment and many sites had non-COVID-19 clinical research suspended and further funding to continue for longer not available\n\nPower calculations revised:\n\n~5000 patients provides 90% power to detect a 3.8% absolute difference in 90 day mortality\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppropriate ethical approval and consent processes\nPre-published method and statistical analysis plan, which was amended in 2019 when the sample size was revised\n\nSetting\n\n53 ICUs in Australia (41) and New Zealand (12)\nSeptember 2017 \u2013 December 2020\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nRequirement for fluid resuscitation\n\nThis was defined as a bolus of fluid administered over one hour or less to increase or maintain intravascular volume in addition to maintenance fluids\nRequirement supported by at least one of seven pre-specified clinical signs (HR > 90bpm, SBP < 100 mmHg, MAP < 75 mmHg, CVP < 10, CRT > 1 sec, UO < 0.5 ml/kg/hr for at least one hour)\n\n\nExpected to be in ICU on three consecutive days\nCVC or arterial line in situ (or imminent placement planned)\nClinical equipoise between PL148 and 0.9% Sodium Chloride\n\n\nExclusion:\n\n< 18 yo\nPrior fluid resuscitation > 500ml in current ICU admission\nContraindication to study fluid\nThose admitted with specific fluid requirements (e.g. burns)\nTBI, or at risk of cerebral oedema\nDeath deemed imminent, or an underlying disease process with life expectancy < 90 days\nKnown or suspected pregnancy\nPrior enrolment in PLUS\n\n\n5037 randomised\n\n2515 BMES and 2522 to saline\n16828 screened\n\n11791 excluded\n\nMajority due to exclusion criteria\n705 due to \u201cother\u201d\n247 due to \u201cICU clinician declines

randomisation: 55.5% vs 23.2%\n\nMedian 625mls of saline received by BMES group\n\n\nClinical Parameters prior to randomisation (HR, MAP) similar\nMedian SOFA score (respiratory and cardiovascular domain) similar\nMedian time from ICU admission to randomisation (hours): 2 vs 2\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nPlasmalyte 148\n\nControl\n\n0.9% Sodium Chloride\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nPatient received assigned study fluid for all episodes of resuscitation and compatible IV crystalloid therapy in ICU until 90 days following randomisation\nIf study fluid was non-compatible with any drugs, then preferably 5% glucose used wherever possible to minimise exposure to alternate fluid\nIf specific crystalloid solutions clinically indicated these were allowed\nIf readmitted within 90 days then use of study fluid continued\nAll other treatment at discretion of treating clinicians\n\nFluid administered post randomisation\n\nTrial fluid administered in 96.0% (BMES) and 96.2% (Saline) of patients\nMedian duration of treatment with assigned fluid:\n\n6 vs 6 days\n\n\nMedian volume of fluid received:\n\n3.9L (BMES) vs 3.7L (Saline)\n\n\nPost randomisation, >500ml alternate fluid administration:\n\n63.0% (BMES) vs 3.5% (Saline)\n\n\nMean difference in serum chloride -1.99 mmol/L (95% CI -2.21 \u2013 -1.76)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nUnadjusted 90-day mortality (BMES vs Saline)\n21.8% v 22.0% (530 deaths in each group)\nARR -0.15% (95% CI -3.6 \u2013 3.3)\n\nSecondary analyses showed no change in primary outcome when those receiving > 500ml of alternate fluid either prior to randomisation or in the ICU post randomisation were excluded\nPost-hoc analysis which aimed to account for those in BMES group who received open label saline also showed no difference in primary outcome\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nComparing PL-148 vs. Sodium Chloride\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nNew RRT\nReceipt of vasoactive drugs\nDays alive and free of mechanical ventilation\nMaximum creatinine level or increase in creatinine\n\n\n\n\nSubgroup Analyses:\n\nNo statistically significant differences noted in any of pre-specified subgroups\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe use of PL-148 compared to 0.9% Sodium Chloride does not reduce 90-day all cause mortality or risk of AKI\n\nStrengths\n\nLarge, randomised trial across 53 ICUs in 2 countries\nProtocols for randomisation and masking of treatments minimise selection and detection bias\nPre-published statistical analysis plan and intention to treat analysis\n96% follow up to day 90\nPatients appear unwell with ~75% needing invasive mechanical ventilation, and low proportion of elective surgical patients\n\nFor comparison elective surgical rates in other trials: BaSICS 48%, SPLIT 57%, Not reported in SMART\n\n\nLarger volumes of trial fluid administered compared to other trials (~4L in 6 days)\n\nFor comparison: BaSICS 2.9L, SPLIT 2L, SMART 1L\n\n\nPrior compatibility testing for Plasmalyte 148 and 87 drugs important to minimise contamination bias\nResults consistent with recently published BaSICS trial\nGiven the extra cost associated with BMES the decision to collect economic data is important\n\nWeaknesses\n\nReduction in recruitment size\n\nThis was unavoidable given pressures external to the trial. Given the futility boundary was crossed at a similar time point to trial cessation it\u2019s highly unlikely that the results would have changed if the trial had continued\n\n\n63% in\u00a0 BMES (as opposed to 3.5% in saline group) received > 500ml of alternate fluid may result in a contamination\n\nFigure 1 shows roughly 200mls/day of \u201copen-label\u201d saline administered to each group\nThere were a large\u00a0number of protocol deviations (Table S5)\n\nResuscitation / Fluid Bolus:\n\nIn BMES group non study fluid administered in 10.8% patients (6.8% albumin, 1.7% saline)\nIn Saline group non study fluid administered in 11.5% (7.3% albumin, 1.9% BMES)\n\n\nMaintenance Fluid:\n\nIn BMES group non study fluid administered in 6.1% patients (2.3% saline)\nIn Saline group non study fluid administered in 5.7% (1.3% BMES)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFluids not controlled or recorded outside of ICU\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis high quality, large, randomised trial provides no evidence that 0.9% Sodium Chloride causes harm\nThis trial was published alongside a large meta-analysis of ~35000 patients (including this trial) in which the estimated effect of BMES vs 0.9% Sodium Chloride ranged from a 9% relative reduction to 1% relative increase of death by day 90. In sepsis, the use of BMES was even more pronounced with a range from 14% relative reduction to a 1% increase\nAlthough these confidence intervals are not statistically significant, my personal preference will be to continue to use balanced crystalloids in non neuro-ICU patients\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Balanced Multielectrolyte Solution versus Saline in Critically Ill Adults\n[meta-analysis] Balanced Crystalloids versus Saline in Critically Ill Adults \u2014 A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis\n[further reading]\u00a0Intravenous fluid therapy in the perioperative and critical care setting: Executive summary of the International Fluid Academy (IFA)\n[Livestream] Critical Care Reviews Livestream\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @hgmwalker89\nSummary date: 19th January 2022\nPeer-review editor: @celiabradford\nPicture by: iStock\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
