N Engl J Med 2015, Nov 11. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1510991\nClinical Question\n\nIn healthy adults taking either apixaban (ANNEXA-A) or rivaroxaban (ANNEXA-R) does andexanet alfa compared to placebo normalise anticoagulation?\n\nDesign\n\n2 part, phase 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study\nCentral randomisation via an interactive web-based response system\n2 consecutive parts within each sub-trial:\n\nPart 1 \u2013 bolus dose of andexanet vs. placebo\nPart 2 \u2013 bolus dose followed by a 2-hour infusion vs. placebo\n\n\nDoubled blinded \u2013 the participants and the researchers were unaware of allocation;only a designated research pharmacist aware\n145 participants were sufficient to provide a 99% power to detect a difference in the percentage change in anti-factor Xa activity from baseline at a two sided alpha level of 5% within each part of the study\n\nSetting\n\n2 separate sites:\n\nANNEXA-A in Arizona, USA\nANNEXA-R in California, USA\n\n\nMarch 2014 to May 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nReasonably healthy volunteers aged 50-75 years of age\nIn ANNEXA-A participants received 5mg of apixaban twice daily\nIn ANNEXA-R participants received 20mg of rivaroxaban once daily\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nHistory of abnormal bleeding, active bleeding or risk factors for bleeding\nHistory of thrombosis or risk factors for thrombosis\nHistory of adult asthma or use of inhaled medications\n\n\n145 patients randomly assigned to andexanet or placebo in a 3:1 ratio (ANNEXA-A) or a 2:1 ratio (ANNEXA-R)\n\nIntervention\n\nANNEXA-A\n\nAll participants received 5mg of apixaban orally twice daily for 3.5 days to achieve steady state plasma levels\nAndexanet administered 3 hours after last dose to coincide with peak plasma concentration\nPart 1 \u2013 Bolus\n\n400 mg andexanet IV bolus at 30 mg/minute rate\n\n\nPart 2 \u2013 Bolus and Infusion\n\n400 mg andexanet IV bolus (same as Part 1) followed by infusion at 4 mg/minute for 120 minutes\n\n\n\n\nANNEXA-R\n\nAll participants received 20mg of rivaroxaban orally once daily for 4 days to achieve steady state plasma levels\nAndexanet administered 4 hours after last dose to coincide with peak plasma concentration\nPart 1 \u2013 Bolus\n\n800 mg andexanet IV bolus at 30 mg/minute rate\n\n\nPart 2 \u2013 Bolus and Infusion\n\n800 mg andexanet IV bolus (same as Part 1) followed by infusion at 8 mg/minute for 120 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\nAll four groups above (ANNEXA-A Parts 1 and 2; ANNEXA-R Parts 1 and 2) were matched with four groups who received identically prepared placebo at the same administration rates\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: anti-factor Xa activity was reduced to a greater extent with andexanet compared to placebo (expressed as mean reduction as percentage of baseline \u2013 higher % demonstrates greater normalisation of anticoagulation)\n\nPart 1 \u2013 Bolus:\n\nANNEXA-A 94\u00b12% vs. 21\u00b111% (p < 0.001)\nANNEXA-R 92\u00b111% vs. 21\u00b115% (p < 0.001).\n\n\nPart 2 \u2013 Bolus and Infusion:\n\nANNEXA-A 92\u00b13% vs. 33\u00b16% (p < 0.001)\nANNEXA-R 97\u00b13% vs. 45\u00b112% (p < 0.001)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nThrombin generation \u2013 treatment with andexanet appeared to restore thrombin generation (expressed as change in mean thrombin generation \u2013 higher value demonstrates stronger coagulation)\n\nPart 1 \u2013 Bolus:\n\nANNEXA-A 1323.2\u00b1335.4 nM\u00b7min vs. 88.2\u00b1125.8 nM\u00b7min (p < 0.001)\nANNEXA-R 1314.2\u00b1331.2 nM\u00b7min vs. 173.9\u00b1104.2 nM\u00b7min (p < 0.001)\n\n\nPart 2 \u2013 Bolus and Infusion:\n\nANNEXA-A 1193.1+/- 263.3 nM\u00b7min vs. 189.4+/- 184.8 nM\u00b7min (p < 0.001)\nANNEXA-R 1510.4 +/- 344.8 nM\u00b7min vs. 264.4 +/- 140.7 nM\u00b7min (p < 0.001)\n\n\n\n\nUnbound fraction of apixaban and rivaroxaban \u2013 andexanet reduced the measured unbound concentration of apixaban and rivaroxaban by a statistically significant change when administered either by bolus (Part 1) or by bolus + infusion (Part 2)\nSafety concerns\n\nThere were no serious events reported and no thrombotic events reported\nOne patient developed hives and had the andexanet infusion discontinued after 35 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThis study provides good evidence that andexanet rapidly restores factor Xa activity, thrombin generation and reduces the unbound fraction of Xa inhibitor in older subjects treated with apixaban or rivaroxaban\n\nStrengths\n\nHighly relevant and important clinical question\nWell designed phase 3 studies\nClear objective measurable outcomes\nAppropriate study design with appropriate blinding of researchers and participants\nClear description of participants who didn\u2019t complete the study protocol\nAnalysed on an intention to treat basis. Only one participant wasn\u2019t included as described above. One subject withdrew and another was lost to follow up but both were included in the efficacy and safety analyses\nInclusion of older subjects (population who are more likely to take Xa inhibitors)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAlthough effort was made to match the study population to the population who most commonly have atrial fibrillation and venothromboembolic disease the median age ranged from 53-60 in the 8 groups above, which is still quite a lot lower than the median age range in the large atrial fibrillation trials (70-73)\nThe subjects all had normal renal function and body mass index <28 again not representative of the typical population who might be talking factor Xa inhibitors\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBoth ANNEXA-A and ANNEXA-R show impressive reversal of anti-factor Xa activity by andexanet.\nIt should however be made clear that safety data of any meaning will only come from larger phase 3b-4 studies, which are in progress (Clinical trials.gov NCT02329327). Caution must be exercised with any new drug particularly if the results are used to guide emergency reversal of patients anti-coagulated with factor Xa inhibitors, which of course is the intended aim of such agents due to the myriad of factors that affect bleeding tendency in the acute setting.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Andexanet Alfa for the Reversal of Factor Xa Inhibitor Activity\n[editorial]\u00a0Antidote for Factor Xa Anticoagulants\n[youtube]\u00a0Mode of action of Andexanet Alfa\n[youtube]\u00a0The ANNEXA-A and ANNEXA-R Trials\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DrJamiePlumb\nSummary date: 27 January 2016\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n"
