To allow for a 3% rate of withdrawal of consent, the recruitment target was 516 patients\n\nSetting\n\n34 general ICUs in the UK\nJan 2014 \u2013 Dec 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\u00a0Adult patients with suspected or confirmed infection and 2 or more SIRS criteria who are dependent on vasopressors for at least four hours to maintain their blood pressure\n\nSIRS criteria are:\u00a0fever (>38C) or hypothermia (< 36C), HR > 90 beats/minute), RR > 20 breaths/minute or PaCO2 < 4.3 kPa) or need for mechanical\u00a0ventilation,\u00a0abnormal leukocyte count (> 12,000 cells/mm3, < 4000 cells/mm3, or > 10% immature forms)\n\nExclusion:\u00a0More than 24 hours since meeting all the inclusion criteria; end-stage renal failure at presentation (previously dialysis-dependent); severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C); a\u00a0history of Torsades de Pointes; known significant mechanical obstructions affecting ventricular filling or outflow or both; treatment limitation decision in place (eg DNAR or not for ventilation/ dialysis); known or estimated weight >135kg; pregnancy; previous treatment with levosimendan within 30 days; known hypersensitivity to levosimendan or any of the excipients; known to have received another investigational medicinal product within 30 days or currently in another interventional trial that might interact with the study drug\n2382 patients were assessed for eligibility; 516 patients were recruited\nBaseline characteristics were similar in both groups:\n\nmedian time to recruitment was 16 hours after the initiation of vasopressors\nmedian dose of norepinephrine was 0.28\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/min at the time of starting the study drug\nmore patients in the levosimendan group had ischaemic heart disease (17.8% vs 12.1%)\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nIntravenous infusion of levosimendan 0.05 to 0.20 \u03bcg/kg/min for 24 hours in addition to standard care\n\nThe study drug infusion was commenced at 0.1 \u00b5g/kg/min, and if tolerated, increased after 2-4 hours to 0.2\u00a0\u00b5g/kg/min for the remaining 20-22 hours (maximum 24 hour infusion)\nIf there were any subsequent adverse\u00a0effects (hypotension and/or tachycardia), the rate of infusion was reduced back to 0.1 \u00b5g/kg/min\nIf there were adverse effects at an infusion\u00a0rate of 0.1 \u00b5g/kg/min (either initially or later) then the rate of infusion was be reduced to 0.05 \u00b5g/kg/min or\u00a0discontinued\n\n\n\nControl\n\nIntravenous infusion of placebo for 24 hours in addition to standard care\n\nIn both groups\n\nThe study drug was not be started until the treating physician was confident that adequate fluid\u00a0resuscitation has been achieved and the patient has reached their target mean arterial pressure (suggested\u00a0target 65-70 mmHg)\nExamples of appropriate targets for adequate fluid resuscitation included any or all of the following:\n\nCentral venous pressure \u22658mmHg (\u226512 mmHg in mechanically ventilated patients); good peripheral perfusion on clinical examination; other measures of cardiac output / flow, e.g. Stroke Volume Variability (SVV) and Global End-Diastolic\u00a0Volume Index (GEDVI)\n\n\nThe lowest dose of vasopressors that maintained tissue perfusion and the target mean arterial pressure was recommended\nAdditional inotropic agents (dobutamine recommended) could be used if clinically indicated (e.g for low cardiac output state after fluid resuscitation), with lowering of the dose once adequate oxygen delivery had been achieved\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: mean daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score in the ICU up to day 28\n\nno significant difference in the mean (\u00b1SD) SOFA score between the levosimendan group and the placebo group (6.68\u00b13.96 vs. 6.06\u00b13.89; mean difference, 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], \u22120.07 to 1.29; P=0.053)\n\n\n\ntable corrected post first publishing\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nDeath at 28 days, at ICU discharge and at hospital discharge: no statistical difference between patients in the levosimendan and placebo group\n\n28 day mortality:\u00a034.5% vs 30.9% P=0.43\nMortality at ICU discharge:\u00a032.2% vs 29.6% P=0.59\nMortality at hospital discharge: 37.6% vs 32.8% P=0.3\n\n\ncardiovascular effects:\n\nStudy drug infusion was stopped before before the 24 hour time point owing to haemodynamic instability: 13.5% in the levosimendan group vs 7.7% in the placebo group\nmean arterial pressure was lower in those patients in the levosimendan group in the first 24 hours\nthe rate and duration of norepinephrine infusion were higher on the levosimendan group\nthe heart rate over the first 4 days was significantly higher in patients in the levosimendan group\n\n\ntime to extubation\n\npatients in the levosimendan group were less likely than those in the placebo group to be successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation over the period of 28 days (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.97; P=0.03)\n\n\nNo statistical difference in any of the following secondary outcomes\n\nmedian number of catecholamine free days\nmedian number of ventilation free days\nincidence & duration of renal failure (AKIN criteria)\nmedian length of ICU and hospital stay\n\n\nAdverse events\n\nmore patients in the levosimendan group than in the placebo group had supraventricular tachyarrhythmia: 3.1% vs 0.4%; P=0.04\nno statistical difference in any other life threatening arrhythmia, myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe addition of levosimendan to standard treatment in adults with sepsis was not\u00a0associated with less severe organ dysfunction or lower mortality. Levosimendan was\u00a0associated with a lower likelihood of successful weaning from mechanical ventilation\u00a0and a higher risk of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomisation sequence was prepared by an independent statistician\nTrial specific labelling and packaging was used for the study drugs\nPatients and clinical and research staff remained unaware of the trial group assignment\nSubgroup analyses were planned a priori\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNo echocardiographic analyses were performed\nThe target mean arterial pressure was frequently exceeded in both groups\nThe primary outcome was an average of the SOFA scores from each patient\u2019s complete stay on ICU. This is arguably a surrogate for mortality and other meaningful patient-centred outcomes. Also, there may be a difference in the distribution of SOFA scores against time, but by averaging the scores this difference has been lost in the analysis.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn adults with sepsis, a 24 hour infusion of levosimendan, in addition to standard treatment, was not\u00a0associated with less severe organ dysfunction or mortality compared with placebo and standard treatment. There may be associated harm from levosimendan given the higher incidence of haemodynamic instability and the longer duration of mechanical ventilation.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Levosimendan for the Prevention of Acute oRgan Dysfunction in Sepsis\n[further reading] LeoPARDS protocol\n[videocast] Interview with Professor Anthony Gordon (iCTV Hot Topics ESICM)\n[review]\u00a0Levosimendan in the Treatment of Acute Heart Failure, Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: A Critical Review.
