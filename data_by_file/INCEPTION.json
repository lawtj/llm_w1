Survival to hospital discharge was improved with ECPR: 6/14 (43%) vs 1/15 (7%) (with a posterior probably of benefit 0.98%), although it was stopped early due to benefit, was single centre, and had small numbers\nThe PRAGUE OHCA trial (JAMA 2022) included 260 patients, with VT/VF and PEA. A hyperinvasive approach, including earlier transport from the scene and higher rates of ECMO, resulted in numerically but not significantly increased improvement in a good neurological outcome at day 180 (32% vs 22% P=0.09). This trial was also stopped early due to futility, was single centre, and had a 7.5% crossover rate\n\n\nThus, the evidence for ECPR in OHCA is limited, being limited to single centres with low numbers, and there is concern about the generalisability of these findings to other systems.\n\nDesign\n\nThe INCEPTION trial was a multicentre, randomised, unblinded, parallel-group, investigator-initiated clinical trial\n\nSetting\n\n10 cardiosurgical centres and 12 emergency medical services in the Netherlands\n\nMixture of higher volume (2x>30 total cases) and lower volume (8x<15cases) centres\n\n\nRecruitment was from May 2017 through to February 2021\n\nTwo pauses of the trial occurred during the coronavirus outbreak in 2020 and 2021 but resumed immediately afterwards (Figure S1 in supplement)\n\n\nNo specific trial protocol \u2013 rather existing local emergency services (EMS) and hospital ECPR protocols were used\nLocation of ECPR initiation was mixed (ED, angiography lab) and cannulators (surgeons, interventional cardiologists, and intensivists)\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nOut of hospital cardiac arrest patients\n18-70 years old\nWitnessed\nShockable initial rhythm (VF or VT diagnosed by EMS, or shockable rhythm on AED)\nRefractory (Cardiac arrest persisting despite >15 minutes advanced life support)\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nReturn of spontaneous circulation with sustained HD recovery within 15 minutes\nSevere pulmonary disease (grade III or IV on the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease criteria)\nDisseminated oncologic disease\nObvious or suspected pregnancy\nBilateral femoral bypass surgery\nKnown contraindications for extracorporeal CPR\nKnown advance health-care directive prohibiting resus-\ncitation or invasive ventilation\nExpected time interval of more than 60 minutes between\nthe initial cardiac arrest to the initiation of the\ncannulation procedure\nKnown Cerebral Performance Category score of 3 or 4 (indicating severe neurologic disability or persistent vegetative state)\nbefore cardiac arrest\nMulti-injury trauma (Injury Severity Score >15 on a scale of 0 to 75, with higher scores indicating more severe injury\nTerminal heart failure (NYHA class III or IV)\n\n\n\nEnrolment, Randomisation and Blinding\n\nEnrolment and randomisation occurred either during EMS transport (after patient information was relayed to the receiving hospital) or once arrived at the hospital\nEMS teams were blinded en route (but not at the hospital)\nRandomization occurred in a 1:1 ratio with\n\nPermuted-blocks (in block sizes of 2, 4, and 6)\nStratified according to center\nSmartphone application (Randomizer, Medical University of Graz, Aus-trial)\n\n\nRandomised patients were again assessed upon arrival at the hospital and could be excluded (ie post randomisation) following a review of the eligibility criteria (these patients were still included in the ITT analysis according to that arm)\nPatients >60 minutes on arrival could still be included (despite it being an exclusion criteria at the time of randomisation)\nPatients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) did not undergo ECPR, but were still included in ITT analysis\n\nScreening\n\n2107 were screened in 5/10 sites that kept a screening log\n\n113 included (after removing 1994 or 95%)\n\nMost exclusions were due to being out of age criteria or initial non shockable rhythm\n44 pateints were not included for logistical reasons (team not available or misinterpretation of selection criteria)\n\n\nA further 47 patients were added from the 5/10 sites that didn\u2019t keep a screening log\n160 patients were randomised\n\n26 were excluded post randomisation in ED\n\n9 unwitnessed, 5 were >70 years old, 5 had non shockable rhythm\n\n\n70 assigned to receive extracorporeal CPR\n\n52 received the intervention (13 had ROSC prior, 3 had \u201clogistic failure\u201d)\n46 had successful cannulation\n\nThus only 46/70 (66%) of the group randomised to ECPR actually successfully received the therapy\n\n\n\n\n64 assigned to conventional CPR\n\n52 received conventional CPR (9 had ROSC prior, 3 crossovers received ECPR \u2013 all died)\n\n52/64 (81%) received the therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of Extracorporeal CPR (n=70) vs Conventional CPR (n=64) groups \u2013 overall reasonably well balanced (below are the means or percentages)\n\nMean age: 54 vs 57\nMale: 90% vs 89%\nCardiac arrest details\n\nPrimary shockable Rhythm: 99 vs 98%\nWitnessed 97% vs 98%\nCPR <5 minutes post arrest: 99% vs 95%\nTotal number of defibrillations: 8 vs 9\n\n\nTransport distance 17km vs 16km\nCause of arrest\n\nAMI 73% vs 81%\nSecondary arrhythmia 16% vs 17%\nPulmonary embolus 1% vs 0\n\n\nMedical history\n\nAcute coronary

(17%)\nDiabetes: 10/62 (16%) vs 6/54 (11%)\nCurrent smoker 20/35 (57%) vs 18/33 (55%)\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Outcome and Power Calculation\n\nThe primary outcome: survival with a favourable neurologic outcome, defined as a Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 or 2 (normal or disabled but independent) at 30 days\n\nThis assessment was performed via an independent neurologist who was unaware of the trial group assignments and completed by telephone or in person.\n\n\nPower calculation:\n\nInitially 49 patients in each group would give an 80% power to detect an improvement from 8% to 30% in the primary outcome. This was inflated by 10% to 55 per group to account for discontinuation.\nFollowing an interim analysis at 70 patients, it was noted that 6/27 (22%) of those assigned to ECPR did not receive it due gaining ROSC prior to ECPR initiation.\nDSMC recalculated the sample size to ensure there would 49 patients in the ECPR group, for a new total of 134 (which was met).\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nExtracorporeal CPR\n\nInitiated by qualified physician via bifemoral approach\nNo prespecified protocol for initiation, maintenance or weaning, rather all done according to local hospital protocol\n\n\n\nControl\n\nConventional CPR\n\nThis was continued until ROSC or declaration of death.\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nPost resuscitation care, including targeted temperature management, was delivered according to 2015 ESR guidelines and institutional protocols\nNeurological assessment and withdrawal of care\n\nConducted according to international guidelines, including neurological evaluation and when indicated, SSEP, CT or EEG\nAppear to have been done by unblinded clinical teams (although this was not clearly specified)\n\n\n\nExtracorporeal CPR vs conventional CPR Time Intervals\n\nStart of arrest to EMS arrival: 8\u00b14 vs 8\u00b14 minutes\nStart of arrest to EMS transport to hospital: 21\u00b19 vs 25\u00b19 minutes\nStart of arrest to randomisation: 32\u00b110 vs 34\u00b112 minutes\nStart of arrest to arrival at ED: 36\u00b112 vs 38\u00b111 minutes\nStart of arrest to start of cannulation: 58 \u00b113 minutes\n\nHospital arrival to start of cannulation: 16 (11-22) minutes\nCannulation time: 20 (11-25) minutes\nStart of arrest until ECLS flow (\u201clow flow\u201d): 74 (63-87) minutes\n46/52 (88%) had successful cannulation and circulation\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nNo significant difference in survival with a favourable neurologic outcome, defined as a Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 or 2 (normal or disabled but independent) at 30 days\nExtracorporeal CPR vs Conventional CPR 14/70 (20%) vs 10/62 (16%), OR 1.4; 95% CI, 0.5 to 3.5; P = 0.52\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\n3-month survival with favourable neurological outcome\n6-month survival with favourable neurologic outcome\n\nNo significant difference\n\n\nAdmission to ICU more common: 57 (81%) vs 23 (36%)\nDiscontinuation of treatment\n\nNeurological unfavourable 24/56 (43%) vs 4/51 (8%)\nMultiple organ failure 15/56 (27%) vs 7/51 (14%)\nNo more treatment options: 5/56 (9%) vs 40/51 (78%)\n\n\n\n\nAdverse events\n\nExtracorporeal CPR vs Conventional CPR\n\nMajor bleeding 11/70 (16%) vs 2 (3%)\nPost anoxic encephalopathy 24/70 (34%) vs 3 (5%)\nLimb Ischaemia 4 (6%) vs 0 (0)\nECMO circulation failure 9 (13%) vs 0 (0)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn this multicentre, pragmatic, randomized, trial, extracorporeal CPR and conventional CPR had similar effects on survival with a favourable neurologic outcome at 30 days in patients with refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by an initial ventricular arrhythmia\n\nStrengths\n\nInternal validity:\n\nWeb based randomisation\nBaseline factors reasonably well balanced\nMinimal loss to follow up\nPrepublished statistical analysis plan, with adjustment of the primary outcome due to site\nIntention to treat analysis\n\nTests the effect of an ECPR strategy and is therefore more \u201creal world\u201d\u00a0than a per protocol analysis\n\n\nSponsorship was independent\nDSMC oversight of trial\nRelatively fast recruitment over the 4 years \u2013 so likely little practice change during the trial\n\n\nExternal generalisability:\n\nMulticentre, covering a broad range of metropolitan sites\nEnrolled the actual population that they set out to investigate, including the younger, witnessed, VF/VT and refractory CA population\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nInternal validity\n\nIntervention\n\nOnly 46/70 (66%) of the group allocated to receive ECPR actually received it \u2013 potentially reducing any treatment effect\n\n\nUnderpowered\n\nControl arm survival was double than planned in the power calculation (16% vs 8%)\nFinal numbers with the primary outcome were small: 14 vs 10 CPC 1 or 2, increasing the risk of type 2 error (false negative)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLack of blinding\n\nReceiving teams in ED were not blinded to their allocation (and they could withdraw patients).\nDecisions about discontinuation of treatment and neuroassessments were not blinded\n\nMedian ICU stay in the ECPR group was 1 (1-4) day vs 4 (1-9) days in conventional CPR group. This is a much shorter shorter interval than in other trials and may point towards a detection bias.\n\n\n\n\nTrial protocol was not specified\n\nPossible significant variability in how the intervention and control were delivered across prehospital, ECPR and hospital settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal validity\n\nThe ECPR centres had highly variable experience\n\nMany sites had low ECPR numbers and were therefore potentially less experienced and with less developed systems of ECPR delivery. This may have been important as previous studies have suggested an important volume outcome relationship in ECMO which is a complex and systems wide intervention\n\nThe time from hospital arrival to start of cannulation (16 minutes) is prolonged compared to other similar studies\nLow flow time was prolonged: median 74 (IQR 63-87) minutes\n\nThis compares to 59 minutes low flow time in the ARREST trial and 58 minutes in the PRAGUE study\nTherefore the \u201cEarly\u201d in the title of INCEPTION would not be consistent with the other two RCTs on this topic\n\n\nSurvival in those that actually received ECPR was 5/52 (9.6%). This is significantly lower than the other previously conducted RCTs (ARREST trial 46%, PRAGUE study 31.5% and current ELSO data 20-30%)\nThus the findings of this study may not be generalisable to other higher volume centres\n\n\n\n\nVery fast EMS times from arrest to hospital\n\n36 and 38 minutes respectively has not been reproduced in many other systems\n\nPossibility contributed to the higher than expected control arm survival\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nExtracorporeal CPR for OHCA with prolonged low flow times did not significantly improve neurologically favourable outcomes in this trial\nHowever, Extracorporeal CPR is a complex system-based intervention, where many factors beyond the ECMO itself drive outcomes for patients. Of note, this trial included lower volume centers that likely had less developed ECPR systems\nThe two previous trials on this topic, with potentially more mature EPCR systems and shorter low flow times, suggest a potential benefit from ECPR\nTherefore the potential benefit of ECPR in these different settings has not been disproven by this study\nFuture research needs define the optimal systems that can deliver effective ECPR, whether these findings are reproducible, and whether ECPR is a cost effective intervention\n\nExternal Links\n\nArticle: Early Extracorporeal CPR for Refractory Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest\nArticle:\u00a0Advanced reperfusion strategies for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and refractory ventricular fibrillation (ARREST): a phase 2, single centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial\nArticle:\u00a0Effect of Intra-arrest Transport, Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, and Immediate Invasive Assessment and Treatment on Functional Neurologic Outcome in Refractory Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Aidan Burrell @aidanburrell\nSummary date: 23/02/203\nPeer-review editor: Chris Nickson @precordialthump\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
