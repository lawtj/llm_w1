Critical Care Medicine 2017; DOI:10.1097/CCM.0000000000002570\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, does Shenfu (a traditional Chinese\nmedicine), improve 28 day mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nTraditional Chinese Medicine has been used for over 1000 years. Shenfu is a type of Chinese Medicine that contains ginseng and aconite. In patients with septic shock Shenfu has been reported to increase mean arterial pressure, reduce lactate and mortality. Studies in animals have reported positive effects of Shenfu on scavenging free radicals, inhibiting inflammatory mediators and suppressing cell apoptosis. With these benefits reported, the authors investigated whether Shenfu could have a potential benefit following in-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nComputer generated block randomisation\nStratified by centre\nTreating physicians non-blinded\nBlinding of assessors\nConsecutive patients\nModified intention to treat analysis: excluded patients whose consent was\nabsent/withdrawn, and patients who were placed under legal guardianship\nSample size calculation: 290 patients would provide 80% power to detect a reduction in mortality from 70% to 50% with a false positive rate of 5%. Considering a 20% drop-out rate and high mortality following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), planned to recruit 500 patients\n\nSetting\n\n50 hospitals in China\nData collected: 2012 \u2013 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria: Adult patients with sustained return of spontaneous circulation following an in-hospital cardiac arrest\nExclusion criteria: Consent absent/withdrawn, placed under legal guardianship\n1022 patients assessed for eligibility of whom 978 included in modified intention to treat analysis\nComparing baseline characteristics of Shenfu vs. control group \u2013 no significant\ndifferences in all 37 baseline characteristics that were assessed\n\nAge: 65.1 vs. 64.6\nHistory of coronary artery disease: 32.1% vs. 31.3%\nCause of cardiac arrest\n\nCardiogenic shock: 27.8% vs. 27.9%\nAcute coronary syndrome: 20.9% vs. 21.4%\nLife threatening lethal arrhythmia: 17.5% vs. 17.1%\n\n\nCause of hospital admission\n\nAcute cardiovascular disease: 29.9% vs. 29.8%\nAcute respiratory disease: 24.2% vs. 24.1%\n\n\nLocation of cardiac arrest\n\nWard: 47% vs. 46%\n\n\nInitial cardiac rhythm\n\nVF: 10.4% vs. 10.1%\nPEA 7.9% vs. 7.6%\nAsytole: 81.7% vs. 82.3%\n\n\nDuration of advanced life support, median (IQR): 13min (6-20) vs. 19 (9-30), p=0.27\nComatose at ICU admission: 96.3% vs. 96.7%\nVentilated: 99.2% vs. 99%\nTherapeutic hypothermia: 18.9% vs. 17.9%\nAngiography or percutaneous coronary intervention: 31.1% vs. 30.5%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nShenfu injection\n\n100ml twice daily for 14 days or until hospital discharge\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard care\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nPost-resuscitation care bundle that included targeted temperature management (TTM), airway and ventilation management, haemodynamic management, early coronary angiography, and comprehensive critical care\nPrognostication after 72 hours: Clinical +/- SSEP or EEG +/- biomarkers\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: 28 days survival \u2013 significantly higher in Shenfu group\n\n42.7% vs. 30.1%, p=0.02\nAbsolute risk reduction = 12.6% (95% CI\u00a06.67% to 18.62%)\nNNT = 8\nFragility index = 33\n\n\nSecondary outcomes \u2013 comparing Shenfu vs. control group\n\nThe Shenfu group had significantly greater rates of\n\nSurvival at 90 days\n\n39.6% vs. 25.9%, p=0.001\n\n\nAlive at discharge with favourable neurological outcome\n\n29.1% vs. 17.1%, p=0.03\n\n\nCerebral Performance Category 1 or 2 in survivors to ICU discharge\n\n70% vs. 59.3%, p=0.03\n\n\n\n\nMultiple organ failure \u2013 significantly higher in control group\n\n44.3% vs. 53.%, p=0.01\n\n\nNo significant differences in:\n\nRenal failure\n\n22.1% vs. 20.2%, p=0.21\n\n\nCardiogenic shock\n\n10.2% vs. 11.1%, p=0.91\n\n\nCause of death\n\nIrreversible brain death: 64.8% vs. 68%\nCardiac: 19.1% vs. 22.1%\nMultiple organ failure: 10.9% vs. 7%\n\n\n\n\nFor longterm survivors, duration of mechanical ventilation \u2013 significantly shorter in Shenfu group\n\n8.6 vs. 12.7 days, p<0.001\n\n\nAdverse events:\n\n2 patients in Shenfu group had pruritus that was not felt due to study drug\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nShenfu improves clinical outcomes including mortality following an in-hospital\ncardiac arrest.\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nBlinding of outcome assessors\nMulti-centre\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPhysicians non-blinded, the authors state that this is because Shenfu is yellow. However it should have still been possible to make a yellow placebo.\nThe study was only carried out in China where traditional Chinese Medicine is more commonly accepted.\nThe sample size calculation planned recruitment 500 patients. It is unclear why so many more patients were recruited and why study recruitment was stopped when it was. It was not reported what the study outcomes were after the planned 500 patients had been recruited\nPost cardiac arrest bundle included TTM for all patients. However, this treatment was only performed on a small proportion of patients. It is unclear why some patients received this treatments where as others did not.\nWe are not told how many patients had their prognostication based on clinical/SSEP/EEG/biomarkers\nThere was a longer duration of advanced life support in the control vs. the Shenfu group 19min (9-30) vs. 13 min (6-20). The author\u2019s report that this difference was not statistically significant. The raw data is not provided that would allow us to check the accuracy of this calculation.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis large multi-centre randomised controlled trial demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality with the use of Shenfu following in-hospital cardiac arrest, with a number needed to treat of 8\nThis compares to a NNT of 6 for the original HACA therapeutic hypothermia trial\nThe sceptic in me tells me that if something appears too good to be true then it probably is\nMy concerns regarding the lack of blinding, the differences in baseline characteristics, the variation in compliance with the post-resuscitation bundle and the fact that the study was performed in a single country means that I want to see more evidence before I start using Shenfu in my practice.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Efficacy and Safety of Combination Therapy of Shenfu Injection and Postresuscitation Bundle in Patients With Return of Spontaneous Circulation After In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Randomized, Assessor-Blinded, Controlled Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0Chinese Medicine Shenfu Injection for Heart Failure: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\n[further reading]\u00a0Shenfu, traditional Chinese medicine in sepsis: are we ready for it?\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: David Slessor\nSummary date: 21 August 2017\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
