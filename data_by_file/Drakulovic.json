Lancet 1999;354:1851-58\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients who are mechanically ventilated does the semi-recumbent position vs. supine position reduce clinically suspected pneumonia?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nComputer-generated list\nConsecutive patients\nSample size calculation: 182 patients required to show a 20% absolute risk reduction with a projected frequency in the supine group of 40%, with a false negative rate of 20% and false positive rate of 5%\nPlanned interim analysis completed after 50% recruitment. This demonstrated a significant difference and the trial was stopped early\nModified intention to treat analysis\nNon-blinded\nUnivariate and multivariate analysis completed\n\nSetting\n\nA respiratory ICU and a medical ICU in a tertiary university hospital in Spain\nJune 1997 \u2013 May 1998\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria: Not stated\nExclusion criteria: Abdominal or neurosurgical intervention within 7 days; shock refractory to vasoactive drugs or volume therapy; previous endotracheal intubation within 30 days\n90 patients randomised\n\n47 patients randomised to control group, all completed and included in trial\n43 patients randomised to intervention group, 4 patients excluded (1 died during resuscitation, 3 excluded due to protocol violation [re-intubation])\n\n\nComparing intervention vs. control groups\n\nMean age: 67 vs. 63\nCause of acute respiratory failure\n\nCOPD: 34% vs. 33%\nOther pulmonary diseases 26% vs. 21%\n\n\nMean APACHE II Score: 23.8 vs. 21.3\nDuration of mechanical ventilation (hrs): 171 vs. 145\nUse of large bore NG tube: 87% vs. 72%\nEnteral nutrition: 60% vs. 56%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nSemi-recumbent (45 degrees)\n\nControl\n\nSupine body position (0 degrees)\n\nAll patients routinely subjected to:\n\n\nSterile endotracheal suctioning\nNo change of mechanical ventilation tubing systems\nStress ulcer prophylaxis with sucralfate in patients who tolerated enteral nutrition, and IV ranitidine or omperazole in patients receiving TPN\nEnteral nutrition\n\nStarting rate 33.3ml/hr\nGastric aspiration performed every 4 hours\nTarget feed 30-35 kcal/kg/day\n\n\n\nStudy completed when any of the following criteria met:\n\n\n1st weaning trial\nExtubation\nPermanent change in body position for >45 minutes\nDeath\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: frequency of clinically suspected pneumonia (Defined as new and persistent infiltrates on Chest x-ray most likely to be due to infection, + at least 2 of: temp >38.3; WBC <4 or >12; purulent tracheal secretions)\n\nSignificantly lower in semi-recumbent vs. supine: 8% vs. 34% (95% C.I. for difference 10-42, P=0.003)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nMicrobiological confirmed pneumonia (defined in patient with clinically suspected pneumonia with bacterial growth above defined threshold of pathogenic microorganism in tracheobronchial aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, or protected specimen brush)\n\nSignificantly lower in semi-recumbent vs. supine: 5% vs. 23% (95% C.I. for difference 4-33, P=0.018)\nIncidence rate of microbiologically confirmed pneumonia 7.3/1000 ventilator days in semi-recumbent vs. 28.4/1000 ventilator days in supine\n\n\nIncidence of clinically suspected pneumonia: 10.9/1000 ventilator days in semi-recumbent vs. 41.2/1000 ventilator days in supine\nICU mortality \u2013 no significant difference\n\n18% in semi-recumbent vs. 28% in supine (95% C.I. -7.6 to 27.6, P=0.289)\n\n\nUnivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that enteral nutrition and supine body position were significantly associated with clinically suspected and microbiologically confirmed pneumonia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn mechanically ventilated patients nosocomial pneumonia is reduced with the use of a semi-recumbent position\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nClear definition for primary and secondary outcomes\n\nWeaknesses\n\nTerminated early with low number of patients included\nOutcome assessors non-blinded\nInclusion criteria not clearly defined\nSingle hospital\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis small randomised trial has a number of weaknesses, but still provides convincing evidence that the risk of clinically suspected, and microbiologically confirmed pneumonia, is reduced in mechanically ventilated patients who are semi-recumbent vs. supine.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Supine body position as a risk factor for nosocomial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients: a randomised trial\n[further reading]\u00a0PulmCCM: Ventilator bundles (VAP bundles) not evidence-based, shouldn\u2019t be standard care\n[Further reading]\u00a0Preventing Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia Does the Evidence Support the Practice?\n[Further reading]\u00a0Critical Care Network in North West London: Ventilator Care Bundle\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Dave Slessor\nSummary date: 6th December 2015\nPeer-review editor: Steve Mathieu\n\n\n"
