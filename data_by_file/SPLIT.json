JAMA. Published online October 07, 2015. doi:10.1001/jama.2015.12334\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients, does the use of a balanced crystalloid solution compared to normal saline effect the incidence of acute kidney injury?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nComputer generated randomisation\nDouble blinded\nCluster, double cross over\nIntention to treat analysis\nNo established statistical methodologies for prospectively determining sample sizes for this type of study and hence no sample size calculations were performed\n\nSetting\n\n4 Intensive Care Units in New Zealand\n\ntertiary ICU\u2019s: 3 general and 1 predominantly cardiothoracic/vascular surgery\n\n\nApril 2014 \u2013 October 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: all ICU patients requiring crystalloid fluid therapy as clinically indicated\nExclusion: end-stage renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), currently requiring RRT or expected to require RRT within 6 hours; admission for consideration of organ donation; admission for palliative care; previous enrolment in trial\n2278 patient enrolled; 1162 into intervention arm, 1116 into control arm\nBaseline characteristics were similar in both groups, Including: age; co-morbidities; time from ICU admission to first fluid; volume of fluid administered prior to enrolment and APACHE II score (14.1 in both groups)\n\nHigh proportion of post elective surgery: 56% vs. 58%\nHigh proportion of cardiac surgery (nearly 50% of study group)\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nPlasma-Lyte 148 (buffered crystalloid)\n\nControl\n\n0.9% sodium chloride\n\nIn both groups\n\nRate and frequency of fluid administration was determined by the treating clinician\nCrystalloid treatment during intervention and procedures performed outside the ICU was the assigned study fluid as far as possible\nNo restrictions placed on other fluids or therapies\nBuffered crystalloid group and saline group received similar volumes of study fluid (median [IQR]), 2000ml [1000-3500ml] vs 2000ml [1000-3250ml], P=0.63\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: proportion of patients with AKI based on RIFLE criteria (\u2018injury\u2019 or greater and based solely on creatinine component) within 90 days of enrolment: no statistical difference\n\n\n9.6% in intervention group vs 9.2% in control group; P=0.77\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome: comparing patients who received Plasma-Lyte 148 with patients who received 0.9% sodium chloride \u2013 no statistical difference in any of the following\n\n\n\nAcute Kidney Injury: Change in creatinine and incidence of AKI\n\nDifference in serum creatinine measured before enrolment and peak creatinine in ICU: 0.21mg/dl vs 0.18mg/dl\nCumulative incidence of AKI (using both RIFLE and KDIGO definitions)\n\n\nRRT: Requirement\n\nIn ICU: 3.3% vs 3.4%\nNo difference in indications for RRT initiation\nPost hospital discharge: none\n\n\nMechanical ventilation: Proportion and duration of patients requiring mechanical ventilation:\n\n68.6% vs 67.7%\n15.3 hours vs 14.2 hours\n\n\nICU readmission during their index stay: 6.9% vs 5.1%\nLength of stay: ICU stay: 1.5 days vs 1.47 days; Hospital stay: 7.45 days vs 7.33\nAll-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality: ICU: 6.6% vs 7.2%; Hospital: 7.6% vs 8.6%\n\nSubgroup analysis\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong patients receiving crystalloid fluid therapy in the ICU, use of a buffered crystalloid compared with 0.9% sodium chloride did not reduce the risk of AKI.\n\nStrengths\n\nAddresses a highly relevant question in practice and builds upon the knowledge from previous fluid trials\nIntervention and control fluids were packaged in macroscopically indistinguishable 1000mls bag labeled \u201cFluid A\u201d or \u201cFluid B\u201d\nTrial recruited and conducted on time and within 6 months\nStatistical analysis plan published before completion of recruitment; including pre-defined subgroup analysis\n99.3% of eligible patients were enrolled into trial\n\nWeaknesses\n\nFeasibility study; sample size and power calculations not possible\n\nthe data were consistent with a treatment effect that lies between a relative decrease of 33% and a relative increase of 17% in in-hospital mortality arising from the use of a buffered crystalloid instead of saline\n\n\nPrimary outcome data not available for 7.5%\nApart from cardiac surgery other Sub-groups all had small number of patients included\nMain reason patients screened were not enrolled into study was that they did not require fluids and the amount of fluid administered within trial was small (median 2l) which raises questions about generalisability\nMore than 90% of patients were exposed to intravenous fluids before enrolment and the majority of pre-enrolment fluid was buffered crystalloid\nPotential of ascertainment bias given that use of 0.9% sodium chloride is associated with hyperchloraemic acidosis and two-thirds of clinician were able to correctly identify fluid type\nPhysiological and biochemical separation were not reported (although manuscript being prepared \u2013 personal communication with author)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThere was no difference in the incidence of acute kidney injury in patients receiving Plasma-Lyte 148 compared to 0.9% saline. Whilst more data from the trial is awaited, I will continue to use balanced solutions.\nThe study does provide reassurance that in elective or moderately sick intensive care patients, giving up to 2L 0.9% sodium chloride results in no increased risk of kidney injury compared with Plasma-Lyte 148\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of a Buffered Crystalloid Solution vs Saline on Acute Kidney Injury Among Patients in the Intensive Care Unit The SPLIT Randomized Clinical Trial\n[editorial]\u00a0Editorial accompanying paper\n[videocast] Presentation of SPLIT trial at ESICM by Dr Paul Young\n[Further reading]\u00a0Association Between a Chloride-Liberal vs Chloride-Restrictive Intravenous Fluid Administration Strategy and Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Adults\n[St Emlyn\u2019s]\u00a0SPLIT trial published.
