DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1508375\nClinical Question\n\nDoes the regular administration of paracetamol to critically ill patients with fever and known or suspected infection, affect the number of ICU-free days?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled study\nIntention to treat analysis\nDoubled blinded\nBlock randomisation with block size of six and stratified according to participating centre\nSample size of 700 patients provided 80% power to detect an absolute difference of 2.2 ICU-free days at 28 days after randomisation, at an alpha level of 0.05\nA Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for the primary outcome analysis. A proportional-odds analysis with the number of ICU-free days categorised as 0 to 7 days, 8-14 days, 15 to 21 days, or 22 to 27 days was used for the subgroup analysis\n\nSetting\n\n23 adult general ICUs in Australia and New Zealand\nFebruary 2013 \u2013 July 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\naged > 16 years with a temperature of >38\u00b0C\u00a0+ known or suspected infection + receiving antibiotics\nEnrolment within 12 hours\n\n\nExclusion: Acute brain disorders; liver dysfunction (AST or ALT > 5x upper limit of normal or bilirubin > 2x upper limit of normal); post cardiac arrest where current or anticipated temperature control was required; rhabdomyolysis; pregnancy; previous enrolment\n700 patients were randomised and 690 were included in the analysis\nBaseline characteristics similar, including age, existing conditions, APACHE II score, time from admission to randomisation, physiological characteristics, sepsis severity, organ support and causative organisms (62.5% vs 62.2%)\n\nIntervention\n\nIntravenous paracetamol: 1g every 6 hours\n\nControl\n\nIntravenous infusion of 5% dextrose (placebo): 100mls every 6 hours\n\nIn both groups\n\nPatients received the study drug until 28 days after enrolment or until the occurrence of one of the following pre-specified cessation criteria: discharge from ICU, resolution of fever, cessation of antimicrobial therapy, death, or the development of a contraindication to the study drug\nRescue physical cooling was permitted if the body temperature rose to 39.5\u00b0C\u00a0or higher\nUse of open label paracetamol was permitted after the course of study medication was completed\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nmedian ICU-free days to day 28: no significant difference\n\n23 (IQR 13-25) in the paracetamol group vs 22 in the placebo group (IQR 12-25) CI 0-1; P=0.07\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome: comparing patients who received paracetamol with patients who did not receive paracetamol\n\nall cause mortality at 28 days: no significant difference\n\n13.9% vs 13.7%\n\n\nall cause mortality at 90 days: no significant difference\n\n15.9% vs 16.9%\n\n\nnumber of days alive from randomisation until 90 days\nmedian length of stay in ICU (days): increased in nonsurvivors and reduced in survivors\n\nnonsurvivors: 10.4 (IQR 4.1 \u2013 16.9) vs 4.0 (1.7 \u2013 9.4); P<0.001\nsurvivors: 3.5 (IQR 1.9 \u2013 6.9) vs 4.3 (2.1 \u2013 8.9); P< 0.01\n\n\nmedian length of stay in hospital (days): increased in nonsurvivors\n\nnonsurvivors: 13.9 (IQR 7.1 \u2013 22.2) vs 7.7 (2.9 \u2013 17.0); P<0.001\nsurvivors: 13.2 (IQR 7.7 \u2013 25) vs 14.1 (8.1 \u2013 27.1); P< 0.13\n\n\nmedian organs support free days: no significant difference\n\nmechanical ventilation: 27 vs 26 \u00a0P=0.14\ninotropes or vasopressors: 27 vs 27 \u00a0P=0.36\nrenal replacement therapy: 28 vs 28 \u00a0P=0.53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nphysiological and laboratory-related variables\n\nmean and maximum axillary temperature at days 0 to 7:\n\nlower overall mean peak body temperature in the paracetamol group\n\n38.4\u00b0C\u00a0vs 38.6\u00b0C absolute difference (AD) -0.25\u00b0C; 95% CI -0.38 to -0.11; P<0.001\n\n\nlower mean daily average body temperature in the paracetamol group\n\n37.0\u00b0C vs 37.3\u00b0C AD -0.28\u00b0C; 95% CI -0.37 to -0.19; P<0.0001\n\n\namong patients in whom the study drug was discontinued owing to discharge from the ICU, 12.3% of the paracetamol group and 23% of the placebo group had a temperature of 38\u00b0C or higher on there last ICU day\n\n\nliver dysfunction necessitating stopping study drug: lower in paracetamol group\n\n8.1% vs 9.9%\n\n\nOthers \u2013 no statistical difference\n\nmean serum C-reactive protein (CRP) in ICU on days 1,3,5 and 7; proportion of patients in ICU with CK of > 5000 units on days 1,3,5 or 7; highest serum creatinine in ICU during first 7 days after randomisation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubgroup analysis \u2013 no statistical difference\n\nICU-free days to day 28 in the following groups\n\npresence or absence of septic shock\nuse or nonuse of aspirin\npresence of absence of high fever (temperature >39\u00b0C\u00a0in the 12 hours before enrolment\nlocation of infection acquisition (community, hospital, or ICU)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nEarly administration of paracetamol to treat fever due to probable infection does not affect the number of ICU-free days\n\nStrengths\n\nA common question with important clinical outcome measures has been addressed\nProtocol was reported before enrolment commenced\nStatistical analysis plan was reported before the interim analysis was conducted\nAllocation concealment and study drugs were masked by being packaged in an indistinguishable 100ml glass bottle\nAll analyses, including post-hoc analyses, were conducted before unmasking the study-group assignments\nOnly 10 patients (1.4%) were lost to follow up\nThe effects of other antipyretics including surface cooling and NSAIDs were considered and there was no difference between the two groups\n\nWeaknesses\n\n\u2018ICU-free days\u2019 is a composite outcome combining mortality and ICU length of stay\n1/3 of patients in each group were exposed to paracetamol in the ICU after the course of the study drug administration\nNo information collected about the use of paracetamol before randomisation or after ICU discharge\nProtocol deviations were high: 30% in paracetamol group and 28% in placebo group. Around a 1/3 of these were related to missed doses of study drug\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nEarly administration of paracetamol to ICU patients to treat fever due to probable infection results in a moderate reduction in temperature but does not effect mortality at 28 or 90 days. The observation that it may result in a longer ICU stay in nonsurvivors and shorter ICU stay in survivors should be interpreted cautiously and only as hypothesis generating.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Acetaminophen for Fever in Critically Ill Patients with Suspected Infection\n[further reading] Supplementary reading\n[podcast] Paracetamol improves recovery in critically ill patients.
