Intervention could increase OR decrease resistance\nTrial ended early and did not meet sample size targetted due to the unit moving to a different site\n2 year follow up means that effect on antibiotic resistance after this period is unknown\nUnblinded study\nLow baseline prevalence of VRE and MRSA in population\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe use of SDD continues to divide opinion amongst ICU clinicians \u2013 concerns remain over its beneficial effect on patient mortality and the promotion of antibiotic resistance. The fact that the study population had low prevalence of VRE and MRSA would limit its application. My view is exactly that of the SuDDICU study \u2013 I would be prepared to introduce SDD in the context of a clinical trial.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Article abstract]\u00a0Effects of selective decontamination of digestive tract on mortality and acquisition of resistant bacteria in intensive care: a randomised controlled trial\n[Comment] Verbugh, H.
