Intensive Care Medicine 2017. published on-line. DOI 10.1007/s00134-017-4911-0\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill adult patients who pass a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), does 1-hour rest compared with immediate extubation reduce re-intubation rates at 48 hours?\n\nBackground\n\nSBTs are used to assess if patients are likely to be successfully liberated from a mechanical ventilator. Post-extubation respiratory failure and the need for re-intubation occurs in 5-30% of patients. These patients have an increased risk of mortality. Respiratory muscles can become fatigued and it is hypothesised that a SBT can lead to fatigue and increase the probability of failure. This trial tried to determine if giving patients a period of rest following a SBT would lead to a higher success rate when liberating patients from a mechanical ventilator.\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n\nCentral randomisation with computerised random-number tables in blocks of 4\nStratified by centre and risk of extubation failure before SBT\n\n\nAllocation concealment maintained through numbered opaque envelopes\nNon-blinded\nInvestigators who collected endpoints excluded from clinical decisions\nRegistered with clinicaltrials.gov\nStatistical analysis\n\nSample size calculation:\n\n1372 patients required to detect a 5% absolute risk reduction in the intervention group from a 15% baseline, with a false negative rate of 20% and a false positive rate of 5%\n\n\nIntention to treat analysis\nCategorical variables compared with Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel x2 or Fisher\u2019s exact test\nNormally distributed continous variables compared with Student\u2019s t test\nNon-normally distributed continous variables compared with Mann-Whitney U test\nMulti-variate model assessed with receiver operating characteristic curve and the goodness of fit by Hosmer-Lemeshow test\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n17 medical-surgical ICUs, Spain\nData collected: October 2013 \u2013 January 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Received invasive mechanical ventilation for \u226512 hours\n\nSuccessfully completed a SBT (screened daily)\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nAge <18 years, tracheostomy, overwhelming respiratory secretions, inability to follow commands, do-not-resuscitate or re-intubate orders, formal indication for non-invasive ventilation after extubation\n\n\n470 patients randomised\nComparing baseline characteristics of control vs. intervention groups\n\nAge: 62 vs. 65, p=0.96\nAPACHE II: 18.3 vs. 17.8, p=0.41\nCo-morbidities >1: 37% vs. 47%, p=0.03\nUpper airway problems: 22% vs. 29%, p=0.08\nCOPD: 14% vs. 17%, p=0.58\n> 1 failed SBT: 11% vs. 12%, p=0.75\nCopious secretions: 15% vs. 9%, p=0.06\nDuration of mechanical ventilation before SBT: 5.5 vs. 5.7 days, p=0.85\nSBT technique\n\nT-tube: 87% vs. 94%\nDuration of SBT of 120min: 31.7% vs. 20.7%, p=0.009\n\n\nHigh risk for requiring re-intubation: 83% vs. 84%\n\nDefined as high risk if met any of the following criteria:\n\nAge >65\nCongestive heart failure as reason for intubated\nCOPD\nAPACHE II >12 on extubation day\nBMI >30\nIneffective cough or copious respiratory secretions (>2 suctioning in the 8 hours before extubation)\n>1 failed SBT\n>1 co-morbidity\nProblems related with upper airway (including intubation >7 days)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nReconnected to ventilator for 1-hour\n\nPost-successful completion of SBT\nAt previous ventilatory parameters\nThen directly extubated\n9 (3.7%) patients did not tolerate reconnection to the ventilator, and therefore directly extubated\n\n\n\nControl\n\nImmediate extubation\n\nPost successful competion of SBT\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nPatients screened daily for SBT\nCriteria for assessing weanability by SBT:\n\nSubjective: resolution of the acute phase of disease for which patient was intubated, adequate cough, absence of tracheobronchial secretions\nObjective: HR <140, sBP 90-160 with no or minimal vasopressors, temp <38C, adequate level of consciousness, SpO2 >90% at FiO2 \u22640.4 and PEEP <8, RR<35, minute volume <10L/min and f/VT <105 breaths/min/L\n\n\nTechnique for SBT (T-tube, low-level pressure support, continuous positive pressure airway pressure (CPAP) and duration (30, 60 or 120 min) at discretion of treating physician\nSuccessful SBT defined as:\n\nCorrect gas exchange (SpO2 \u226585-90%, PaO2 \u226550-60mmHg, FiO2 \u22640.4 pH \u22657.32, increase in PaCO2 <10mmHg),\nHaemodynamic stability (HR <140, systolic BP <180-200mmHg and >90mmHg without vasopressors)\nStable ventilatory pattern (RR <30-35 and <150% from basal)\n\n\nThe protocol at each participating hospital determined the treatment of post-extubation respiratory failure.

When the study is non-blinded there is a concern that this could result in bias.\nThere were some differences in the baseline characteristics of the 2 groups.\nPatients in the different groups were treated differently with those in the control group more likely to have a longer duration of SBT compared with the intervention group.\nOnly after concluding the study did the authors realise that they had miscalculated the sample size. They only recruited 470 patients where as they should have recruited 1372 patients.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn critically ill patients who pass a spontaneous breathing trial, reconnection to a ventilator for 1-hour compared with immediate extubation, significantly reduced the rate of re-intubation within 48 hours.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Reconnection to mechanical ventilation for 1 h after a successful spontaneous breathing trial reduces reintubation in critically ill patients: a multicenter randomized controlled trial\n[further reading]\u00a0Trials directly comparing alternative spontaneous breathing trial techniques: a systematic review and meta-analysis\n[further reading]\u00a0Both Spontaneous Awakening Trials and Spontaneous Breathing Trials\n[further reading]\u00a0ABC trial \u2013 The Bottom Line Review\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: David Slessor\nSummary date: 9th October 2017\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0Adrian Wong\n\n\n"
