Hb levels were measured every 8 hours for the first 2 days and then daily thereafter unless further bleeding\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: All-cause mortality at 45 days\n\nMortality was significantly reduced in the restrictive strategy group compared to the liberal strategy group (5% vs. 9%, P=0.02)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nRate of further bleeding associated with haemodynamic instability or Hb drop of 2 or more within 6 hours: Significantly lower in restrictive group (10%) vs. 16% in liberal group, P=0.01\nFluids & blood products\n\nRBC transfusion: 49% vs. 86% (P=<0.0001)\n\nmean (+/-SD)\u00a0no of units transfused was 1.5 (+/-2.3) vs. 3.7(+/-3.8)\n\n\nFFP: 6% vs. 9% (P=0.13)\nPlatelets: 3% vs. 4% (P=0.27)\nCrystalloids in first 72 hours: 5.5L vs. 5.8L (P=0.19)\nColloids: 19% vs. 21% (P=0.62)\n\n\n\n\nSubgroup analysis\n\nAll-cause mortality at 45 days according to subgroups\n\nChild Pugh A or B 4% vs. 12% (P=0.02)\nChild Pugh C 38% vs. 41% (P=0.91)\nVariceal bleeding 11% vs. 18% (P=0.18)\nPeptic ulcer disease (PUD) 3% vs. 5% (P=0.26)\n\n\nProbability of survival\n\nSlightly higher with the restrictive strategy than with the liberal strategy in the subgroup of patients who had bleeding associated with PUD (hazard ratio, 0.7; 95% CI 0.26-1.25)\nSignificantly higher in patients with cirrhosis and Child Pugh A or B (hazard ratio, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.11-0.85)\nNo different if cirrhotic and Child Pugh C (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI 0.45-2.37)\n\n\nWithin first 5 days, the portal pressure gradient increased significantly in the liberal transfusion group compared with those assigned to the restrictive group (P=0.03)\nOverall rate of complications: Significantly lower in restrictive group (n = 179; 40%) vs.\u00a0liberal (n=214; 48%) P=0.02\n\nTransfusion reactions and cardiac events (mainly pulmonary oedema) more frequent in the liberal-strategy group\n\n\n\n\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised, computer generated\nAppropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria\nAppropriate power calculation\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle centre, non-blinded\n>700 patients admitted with GI bleeding were not screened for inclusion in trial\nAll patients had an endoscopy within 6 hours. These results should not be generalised to centres where this does not happen\nTransfusion protocol violated in 9% of restricted group vs. 3% in liberal group, P<0.001\nTransfusion of packed red cells rather than packed red cells in combination with other blood products (plasma and platelets\u00a0+/- cryoprecipitate) may have caused a coagulopathy in the liberal transfusion group\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAmong patients with an upper GI bleed, a restrictive strategy for blood transfusion can be the standard treatment, providing early source control with an endoscopy is achievable. The study findings are as much about highlighting the importance of 24 hour emergency endoscopy facilities as the resuscitation management of patients with upper GI bleeding.\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf / abstract / doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1211801\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\nNone\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DavidSlessor\nSummary date: 9 May 2014\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@stevemathieu75\n\n\n\n"
