Published on line first on May 10, 2018 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1801601\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients undergoing major elective abdominal surgery, does a restrictive fluid regimen\u00a0compared with a liberal fluid regimen reduce complications and improved disability-free survival?\n\nBackground\n\nAround 310 million patients worldwide undergo major surgery each year\nThe most effective fluid regimen during surgery remains unclear but more recent studies and guidance emphasising the importance of avoiding excessive fluids\nFluid restriction could increase the risk of hypotension and decrease perfusion to the kidneys and other vital organs leading to organ dysfunction\nExcessive intravenous fluids may increase the pulmonary complications, acute kidney injury and poor wound healing\n\nDesign\n\nInternational, randomised controlled study\nPrior to surgery, enrolled patients were asked to complete the 12 item World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS)\nAssignment occurred in a 1:1 ratio in permuted blocks and stratified according to site and planned postoperative destination (critical care or hospital ward) by means of a web-based service\nMost medical and nursing staff caring for patients were not blinded and had knowledge of the group assignments\nAll research staff members who were responsible for the primary outcome remained blinded and unaware of group assignments\nModified intention to treat analyses\n\nOnly those randomised and underwent induction of anaesthesia were included in analysis\n\n\nA target of 2800 patients was initially defined\n\nBased upon an expected disability-free survival at 1 year of 65%\nType I error of 0.05 and power of 90% to detect a hazard ratio of 0.80 using the log-rank test\nIncluded additional 5.7% to account for withdrawals and loss to follow-up\n\n\nThe sample size was increased to 3000 after 2578 patients were randomised because of a greater than expected disability-free survival rate at 1 year\n\nThis provided a final power of 80% to detect a hazard ratio of 0.78\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n47 centres in seven countries\n\nThe mean number of patients per site was 64 (range: 1 to 227)\n\n\nMay 2013 \u2013 Sept 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adults (\u226518 years) undergoing elective major surgery\n\nIncluded a skin incision, an expected operative duration of at least 2 hours, and an expected hospital stay of at least 3 days\nWho had an increased risk of post operative complications:\n\ndefined as at least one of the following:\nage \u226570 years, the presence of heart disease, diabetes, renal impairment (>200 mmol/L (>2.8 mg/dl)), or morbid obesity\u00a0(BMI \u226535 kg/m2),\u00a0preoperative serum albumin <30 g/L,\u00a0anaerobic threshold (if done) <12 mL/kg/min\nor two or more of the following:\nASA 3 or 4, chronic respiratory disease, obesity (BMI 30-35 kg/m2), aortic or peripheral vascular disease, preoperative haemoglobin <100 g/L, preoperative serum creatinine 150-199 mmol/L (>1.7 mg/dl), anaerobic threshold (if done) 12-14 mL/kg/min\n\n\n\n\nExclusion: patients undergoing urgent or time-critical surgery, liver resection, or less extensive surgery (e.g. laparoscopic cholecystectomy) or if they had end-stage kidney failure requiring dialysis\n5223 met eligibility criteria after screening; 3000 patients were randomised\n\nThe mean age was 66 years\n43% underwent colorectal surgery\n64% underwent cancer surgery\nThere were no significant differences between the groups at baseline\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nRestrictive fluids\n\nDesigned to provide a net zero fluid balance\nBolus of balanced salt crystalloid (CSL) was administered at a maximum dose\u00a0of 5 ml/kg of body weight during the induction of anaesthesia\n\nNo other intravenous fluids were to be administered before surgery unless indicated if using a goal-directed device (oesophageal Doppler or pulse wave analyser)\n\n\nThis was followed by a dose of 5 ml/kg/hr until the end of surgery\nFluid infusion was continued postoperatively at a dose of 0.8 ml/kg/hr for at least 24 hours\n\nThe rate of postoperative fluid replacement could be\u00a0reduced if there was evidence of fluid overload and no hypotension, or increased if there was evidence of hypovolemia or hypotension\nVasopressors could first be considered for treating hypotension without evidence of hypovolemia\n\n\nThe total administration of fluid during the first 24-hour period was expected to be approximately half that in the liberal fluid group\nPatients in this group received a median of 3.7 litres of fluid intravenously\n\n\n\nControl\n\nLiberal fluids\n\nBolus of a CSL solution was administered at a dose of 10 ml/kg of body weight during the induction of anaesthesia\nThis was followed by a dose of 8ml/kg/hr until the end of surgery\n\nThe peri-operative dose could be further reduced after 4 hours if clinically indicated\n\n\nFor patients with a body weight of >100 kg, fluid volumes were calculated on the basis of a maximal body weight of 100 kg\nFluid infusion was continued postoperatively at a dose of 1.5ml/kg/hr for at least 24 hours\n\nThis dose could be reduced if there was evidence of fluid overload and no hypotension, or increased if there was evidence of hypovolemia or hypotension\n\n\nPatients in this group received a median of 6 litres of fluid intravenously\n\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nBolus colloid or blood could be used intra-operatively in the two groups to replace blood loss\nAlternative fluid types (other crystalloid, dextrose, or colloid) and electrolytes were allowed postoperatively to account for local preferences and blood biochemical findings\nOliguria was not used as an indication for the additional administration of intravenous fluid\nAll other peri-operative care was performed according to the discretion and practices of local clinicians\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: No difference in disability-free survival up to 1 year after surgery\n\nRestrictive fluid group: 1223 patients (81.9%)\nLiberal fluid group: 1232 patients (82.3%)\nHazard ratio for death or disability: 1.05 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.24; P=0.61)\nDisability defined as a persistent impairment in health status (lasting \u22656 months), as measured by a score of at least 24 points on the WHODAS questionnaire, which reflects a disability level of at least 25% (the threshold point between \u201cdisabled\u201d and \u201cnot disabled\u201d)\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nAcute kidney injury at 30 days occurred more commonly in the restrictive fluid group\n\nRestrictive fluid group: 124 patients (8.6%)\nLiberal fluid group: 72 patients (5.0%)\nRisk Ratio (RR): 1.71 (95% CI 1.29 to 2.27; P < 0.001)\nAbsolute Risk Increase (ARI): 3.59% (95% CI\u00a01.76% to 5.42%; P < 0.001)\nNumber needed to harm (NNH): 28\nAcute kidney injury defined according to the criteria of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes group, on a scale of 1 to 3, with higher values indicating increased severity\n\n\nRenal-replacement therapy at 90 days occurred more frequently in the restrictive fluid therapy group, however this did not reach statistical significance after adjustment for multiple analyses\n\nRestrictive fluid group 0.9% vs Liberal fluid group 0.3%\nRisk Ratio: 3.27 (95% CI 1.01 to 13.8; P = 0.048)\nThreshold to reject null hypothesis was P = 0.004\n\n\nSurgical site infection occured more frequently in the restrictive fluid group, but this again was not significant after appropriate adjustment\n\nRestrictive fluid group 16.5% vs Liberal fluid group 13.6%\nRisk Ratio: 1.22 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.45; P = 0.02)\nThreshold to reject null hypothesis was P = 0.003\n\n\nNo difference in composite of 30 day mortality or major septic complications (sepsis, surgical-site infection, anastomotic leak, or pneumonia\n\nRestrictive fluid group 21.8% vs Liberal fluid group 19.8%\nRisk Ratio: 1.10 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.26; P = 0.19)\n\n\nNo statistically significant difference between restrictive and liberal groups, for the following:\n\nMedian peak serum lactate levels: 1.6 vs 1.6 mmol/l\nMedian peak c-reactive protein on day 3: 136 vs 133 mg/l\nMedian duration of days in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital: 1.8 vs 1.4\nUnplanned admission to the ICU: 10.8% vs 9.7%\nMedian score on quality of recovery scale: 106 vs 107\nDeath at 90 days: 2.1% vs 1.2%\nDeath at 12 months: 6.5% vs 6.6%\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong patients at increased risk for complications during elective major abdominal surgery, a restrictive fluid regimen was not associated with a higher rate of disability-free survival than a liberal fluid regimen and was associated with a higher rate of acute kidney injury\n\nStrengths\n\nImportant research question based upon a reasonable theory\nLarge, multicentre, international study\nAppropriate randomised controlled trial (RCT) methodology for the hypothesis\nAdequately powered for proposed statistical analysis, which increases the strength of the conclusion and reduces the chance of false positive or false negative conclusions\nChosen outcome is meaningful to patients\nStatistical methods are appropriate\n\nThe use of time-based hazard ratios (\u2018how long until an event occurs\u2019) increases the power of the analysis (the ability to accurately reject the null hypothesis) compared to event-based risk ratios (\u2018did an event occur\u2019)\nMultiple imputed data sets allows for analysis where some data were missing without loss of power (this was used for the Acute Kidney Injury secondary outcome, where not every patient had a creatinine measured at the correct time frame)\nHolm-Bonferroni method was applied to control for multiple testing\n\nThis adjusts the P value threshold at which an outcome is \u2018significant\u2019 when multiple hypotheses are tested on the same dataset\nThe probability of a false positive (that is, rejecting the null hypothesis when we shouldn\u2019t) remains low in exchange for a higher chance of a false negative (that is, not rejecting\u00a0the null hypothesis when we should)\n\n\n\n\nAppropriate concealment of allocation sequence through the use of a web-based randomisation system\nBlinding of outcome assessors reduces the possibility of assessment bias, which would usually favour the experimental intervention group\nPragmatic design, allowing clinicians to apply real-world decisions, which increases the external validity (generalisability)\n1 year follow up\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAlthough the theory is reasonable (too much or too little fluid may be harmful), the hypothesis perhaps lacks biological plausibility (can administration of either 3l or 6l in one day modify survival or disability at up to a year later?)\nNot blinded, so clinical staff may have introduced systematic biases in favour of one group or the other\n\nUsually this favours the experimental arm but since no difference was found there is unlikely to be significant bias from this in this trial\n\n\nFluid administration after 24 hours of surgery was not controlled\nMany patients were not weighed on days 1-3\n\nAlthough missing data can be managed through multiple imputed datasets, it\u2019s not as good as complete data\n\n\nProtocol amendment\n\nWith 2,578 enrolled patients there were 300 events (disability or death) giving a 12 month event rate of 14.6%. As this was lower than expected, an increase in the trial sample size to 3,000 (\u2248380 events) was required to provides 80% power to detect HR\u22640.75\nThis protocol amendment was accepted by the Steering Committee\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients at increased risk for complications while undergoing elective major abdominal surgery, a restrictive fluid regimen was not associated with a higher rate of disability-free survival than a liberal fluid regimen 1 year after surgery\nHowever, the restrictive regimen was associated with a higher rate of acute kidney injury\nA modestly liberal fluid regimen is perhaps preferred and the goldilocks principle is reinforced \u2013 not too much, not too little, but an amount that\u2019s just right\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Restrictive versus Liberal Fluid Therapy for Major Abdominal Surgery\n[editorial] Finding the right balance\n[podcast]\u00a0TopMedTalk\u00a0\u2013 Monty Mython interviews Paul Myles (click below)\n\n\nhttp://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/RELIEF_TRIAL_RESULTS_Mixdown_2-2.mp3\nMetadata\nSummary author: Steve Mathieu\nSummary date: 16th May 2018\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
