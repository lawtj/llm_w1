Ann Emerg Med. 2021; 77:338-344. doi:xxx]\nClinical Question\n\nIn adults presenting to the ED with a corneal abrasion is topical tetracaine more effective than placebo to control pain at a 24-48 hour follow up appointment?\n\nBackground\n\nCorneal abrasions are examined in ED after immediately alleviating pain with a topical anaesthetic, but patients are sent home with none after fears of complications\nComplications have been mainly reported in case reports and series and include corneal ulcerations, keratitis, hypopyon and delayed healing\nDespite this, various studies have suggested safety in topical anaesthetic use for 24-48hours\nNo high quality studies looking at efficacy of corneal local anaesthetic use\n\nDesign\n\nProspective randomised double blind, placebo controlled trial\nRandomisation in a 1:1 ratio to receive tetracaine or placebo\nConcealed allocation by computer generated random number generator then sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes\n60 patients per group would have a 95% power to detect a minimum clinical difference in pain scores of 1.5cm on a 10cm numeric rating scale (NRS)\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre urban community ED in Oklahoma City (USA), that sees 86,000 patients a year\nData collected Jan 2015- Sep 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n18-80yrs old presenting with a corneal abrasion\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nContact lens wearers\nPrevious corneal surgery on affected eye\n>36 hrs post injury\nGrossly contaminated FB/co-existing ocular infection\nRetained FB\nPenetrating eye injury\nImmunosuppression\nAllergy to study medications\nInability to attend follow up\nInjury requiring urgent ophthalmology evaluation (large or complicated abrasions with visual loss, corneal ulcers or lacerations)\nInability to speak fluent English or Spanish\n\n\nBaseline clinical and demographic characteristics (Tetracaine vs Placebo)\n\nMale: 61% vs 58%\nMedian Age: 35 vs 38\nBaseline NRS pain rating: 7 vs 7\nMechanism:\n\nMetalic FB: 14% vs 9%\nOther FB: 29% vs 25%\nDirect trauma: 17% vs 34%\nUnknown: 40% vs 32%\n\n\nLanguage spoken\n\nEnglish: 97% vs 97%\nSpanish: 3% vs 3%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nTetracaine 0.5%\n\n1 drop every 30mins PRN for maximum 24 hours\nA single 2ml bottle\n\n\n\nControl\n\nA balanced artificial tear solution\n\nTrade name: Systane\n1 drop every 30mins PN for maximum 24 hours\n4 separate 0.5ml ampules\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll patients also given:\n\nAntibiotic drops mixture of polymyxin B/trimethoprim 2 drops 4 hourly\nA prescription for hydrocodone/paracetamol 7.5/325mg PRN for breakthrough pain\n\n\nPatients asked to record:\n\nPain measurements on NRS before and 2mins after use of study drops\nAmount of hydrocodone taken between discharge and ED follow up\n\n\nAll patients followed up at 24-48 hours by a blinded EM physician who:\n\nExamined under slit lamp looking for persistence/delayed healing or complications- if present referred to blinded study ophthalmologist\nAsked for an overall NRS score after using study drops\nCollected study drops at this appointment to prevent prolonged use\n\n\nAll patients were asked to then be followed up with a blinded study ophthalmologist at 1 week\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Overall NRS pain score measured at the patient\u2019s initial ED follow up at 24-48hours was significantly lower in the tetracaine group\n\nNRS score 1 vs 8; difference of 7; CI 6-8; P<.001\nChange to NRS from baseline score:\n\nTetracaine 6; 95% CI 5-7\nPlacebo 0; 95% CI 0-0\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: Patients in tetracaine group ingested less hydrocodone then in placebo group\n\n1 in tetracaine group vs 7 in placebo. Difference 6; CI 4-6\n\n\n\n\nAdverse effects between groups were non significant\n\n3.6% in tetracaine group vs 11% in placebo. CI -2.9 to 18\n\n\nNumber of patients with small residual corneal abraision at 24-48 hour follow up \u2013 no significant difference\n\n18% in tetracaine group vs 11% in placebo. CI -6.4 to 20.4\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nShort term topical tetracaine is safe and efficacious as an analgesic for corneal abrasions, is associated with less hydrocodone use compared with placebo\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled\nReasonable attempts to blind both patients and physicians involved\nIntention to treat methodology\nDespite single centre still has external validity\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNo mention of how they selected patients, all physicians where trained to recruit which was possible 24/7 but no mention of whether all were assessed for eligibility i.e. likely convenience sample\nBlinding is limited given:\n\nPhysician enrolling \u2013 tetracaine and placebo arm had different number of ampoules/bottles in envelopes ( 1 in tetracaine vs 4 in placebo). Envelope unlikely to fully mask this\nPatient- will be able to calculate if they had been allocated study group given they will recognise that tetracaine stings when first applied\n\n\nOnly 20% in study arm and 18% in control attended 1wk follow up with ophthalmologist. Despite this:\n\nThey did attempt to contact all that didn\u2019t attend by either phone or searching local electronic records or both\n95% in the study arm and 93% control arm did attend the 24-48hr ED follow up where the necessary primary outcome data was collected\n\n\nSecondary endpoint of adverse effects:\n\nMay lack reliability as description of healing corneal abrasion is subjective. \u00a0Physician initially assessing is likely to be different to physician reviewing at ED follow up\nNo standardised approach thus difficult to ensure consistency of results.\nThis study is not powered for safety\n\n\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov only after study had been completed\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study indicates tetracaine is more effective in providing analgesia compared to commonly used alternative- artificial tears with a significant difference in NRS scores at 24-48hours. This specific study has not been powered for safety and should not be used for this. Other studies have however shown safety for short term use\nAs a result of this combined information I will selectively start prescribing topical tetracaine for patients with simple uncomplicated corneal abrasions that I am confident will follow advice on use being short term only\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Short-Term Topical Tetracaine Is Highly Efficacious for the Treatment of Pain Caused by Corneal Abrasions: A Double-Blind, Randomized Clinical Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0Waldman: Topical Tetracaine Used for 24 Hours Is Safe and Rated Highly Effective by Patients for the Treatment of Pain Caused by Corneal Abrasions: A Double-blind, Randomized Clinical Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0A Prospective, Randomized, Double-masked Trial to Evaluate the Role of Topical Anesthetics in Controlling Pain after Photorefractive Keratectomy\n[further reading] REBELEM: Corneal Abrasions and Short-Term Topical Tetracaine\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Halah Zareian @DocHZ\nSummary date: 3/3/21\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\nImage by: Rudy and Peter Skitterians from Pixabay\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
