JAMA Surg. 2022; 157: 384 \u2013 393. doi:10.1001/jamasurg.2022.0269\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients undergoing major abdominal surgery who are at high nutritional risk and have poor tolerance to enteral nutrition (EN) does the early use of supplemental parental nutrition (E-SPN), compared with late supplemental parental nutrition (L-SPN), reduce the risk of nosocomial infection?\n\nBackground\n\nEN should be implemented as soon as possible following major abdominal surgery, however in many cases the energy delivery by EN is less than the estimated requirements\nA 2022 meta-analysis showed that a combination of EN with PN \u201cimproved nutrition intake in the acute phase of critical illness in adults and was not inferior regarding the patients\u2019 outcomes\u201d\nThe 2017 ESPEN guidelines for clinical nutrition in surgery\u00a0suggest \u201cthat if the energy and nutrient requirements cannot be met by oral and enteral intake alone (<50% of caloric requirement) for more than seven days, a combination of enteral and parenteral nutrition is recommended (Good Practice Point)\u201d\nFor context, the evidence and recommendations vary for SPN in ICU:\n\nThe EPaNIC study in 2011 showed potential harm with early SPN, however the 2017 TOP-UP study showed no increased risk of infection with SPN\nThe 2016 SCCM and ASPEN guidelines recommend the \u201cuse of supplemental PN be considered after 7\u201310 days if unable to meet >60% of energy and protein requirements by the enteral route alone. Initiating supplemental PN prior to this 7- to 10-day period in critically ill patients on some EN does not improve outcomes and may be detrimental to the patient. [Quality of Evidence: Moderate]\u201d\nThere is some suggestion that the infectious complications seen with PN may have related to early caloric overfeeding, as when calories administered by EN and PN were similar there was no difference in ICU infections\n\nAs such, the 2019 ESPEN nutrition in critical care guidelines suggest full EN or PN be prescribed from 3 to 7 days\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nInvestigator initiated, multi-centre, randomised trial\nOpen label\nRandomised in 1:1 ratio\n\nStratified by different centres\nSequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes used for randomisation\n\n\nClinicians involved in follow up blinded, alongside statisticians\nSample size calculations based on incidence of nosocomial infection of 25% in those receiving PN\n\nBased

abdominal surgery\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised trial\nNo loss to follow up\nAnalysed on intention to treat basis\nBalanced baseline characteristics\nClear separation in energy and protein intake during the intervention period (between days 3 and 8)\nResults consistent with similar previous studies\nAlthough this paper has a low rate of critical care patients this is still an important trial for critical care practitioners as this cohort of patients will be admitted to ICU; additionally in some countries ICU physicians will look after PN patients on the wards\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle country may reduce external generalisability\n\n~2/3 of patients came from 4 of the sites\n\n\nSmall trial, with a calculated Fragility Index of 1\nNot a truly patient orientated primary outcome\nSignificant exclusion criteria:\n\nDiabetics may be an important group to study with risk of hyperglycaemia\nDid not include emergency surgical patients\nDifficult to extrapolate these results to all ICU patients however every patient in ICU > 48 hours should be considered at risk of malnutrition so likely that ICU patients may meet the malnutrition risk criteria\n\nICU admission is a scoring point on NRS2002 score\n\n\n\n\nNo record of numbers in L-SPN group that actually received PN\n\nDid all patients in the L-SPN group receive PN? If so, was it needed?\n\nIt\u2019s possible that by day 8 EN would be sufficient (>80% requirements) and therefore PN was not required for those randomised to L-SPN\n\n\n\n\nUnable to blind bedside clinicians and patients\nTime lag bias\n\nData collection finished in 2018, and wasn\u2019t analysed until 2020 with publication this year\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFor patients in ICU post abdominal surgery with poor enteral intake I will now consider, alongside the ICU dieticians, the early implementation of SPN\nAlthough a large proportion of patients were not critically unwell in this study, it seems critical illness increases nutritional risk and early (>3 days) SPN may reduce risk of nosocomial infections in a cohort of patients at high nutritional risk\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Effect of Early vs Late Supplemental Parenteral Nutrition in Patients Undergoing Abdominal Surgery: A Randomized Clinical Trial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @hgmwalker89\nSummary date: 16th May 2022\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\nPicture by: Pexels/cottonbro\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
