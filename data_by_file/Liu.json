Doi:10.1007/s00134-018-5267-9\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients with septic shock, does the use of terlipressin compared to norepinephrine reduced 28-day mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nSepsis is one of the most common conditions treated by critical care clinicians worldwide\nThe best management strategies e.g. target parameters, fluids, vasopressors, etc remain widely debated\nTraditional vasopressors such as norepinephrine and adrenaline are now being joined by newer agents, such as vasopressin, terlipressin and angiotensin 2, with mixed results\nTerlipressin, being more selective for V1 receptors, has theoretical benefits over non-selective vasopressin\nPrevious trial\u00a0in patients with liver cirrhosis showed that terlipressin is as effective as norepinephrine as a vasopressor in patients with cirrhosis and septic shock\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, multicentre\nDouble-blinded (patient, clinicians and assessors)\nStratified by investigating centres combined with block randomisation\nRandomisation by sequential numbered, opaque, computer-generated sealed envelopes\nModified intention-to-treat analysis\nPower calculation\n\nBaseline mortality 50% at 28 days\nPowered at 80% to detect absolute 10% difference\n10% estimated drop-out rate\nTwo-sided alpha error of 0.05\nTarget recruitment 1100 pts\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n21 ICUs in China\nJanuary 2013 to February 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Over 18 years old with septic shock\n\n2 SIRS criteria\nProven or suspected infection\nHypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation\n\nHypotension defined as SBP<90mmHg, MAP<70mmHg or SBP decrease >40mmHg or > 2 standard deviation below normal for age\n\n\n\n\nExclusion: unstable coronary syndrome, previous use of terlipressin for BP support during current ICU admission, malignancy or disease for which mortality was estimated to be very high, acute mesenteric ischaemia (suspected or proven), Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, pregnancy, organ transplantation\n684 pts screened -> 617 randomised -> 526 analysed (260 terlipressin, 266 noradrenaline\n\n14% lost to follow up, withdrew or excluded post-randomisation\n\n\nBaseline characteristics similar in both groups\n\nMean age 61\nMean SOFA 11\nMean APACHE2 score 19\nMean BP 67mmHg\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nTerlipressin\n\nMade as 0.02 mg/ml in 50mls syringes\nCommenced at 1 ml/hr (0.33 mcg/min)\nTitrated 1\u20138 ml/hr (max 2.66 mcg/min)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNorepinephrine\n\nMade as 0.22 mg/ml in 50mls syringes\nCommenced at 1 ml/hr (3.66 mcg/min)\nTitrated 1\u20138 ml/hr (max 29.33 mcg/min)\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nTitrated to achieve target BP (suggested MAP of 65 to 75 mmHg but left to discretion of treating ICU physician)\nOpen label norepinephrine was allowed if target BP not achieved with maximum rate of study drug\nOther open label vasopressors if maximum dose of study drug AND open label norepinephrine failed to achieve target BP\nTapering of open label drug was conducted first before study drug tapered\nTapering of study drug only when target BP maintained for 12 hrs without open label drugs\nStudy drug was interrupted if any serious adverse events occurred (defined)\nIf subsequent recurrence of shock required\u00a0vasopressors, the study drug was preferentially used\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nNo significant difference in 28 day all cause mortality\nTerlipressin group: 40%\nNorepinephrine group: 38%\nAbsolute risk increase (ARI): 2% (95% CI -9.8% to 18.8%;\u00a0P = 0.633)\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nChanges in SOFA score on day 7 after randomisation\nDays alive\nDays free of vasopressor during 28 days after randomisation\n\n\nMore serious adverse events in terlipressin group\n\nTerlipressin group 30% vs noradrenaline group 11.65%\nMainly digital ischaemia\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThere was no significant reduction in 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock treated with terlipressin compared to norepinephrine\n\nStrengths\n\nGood external generalisability \u2013 multicentre trial with inclusion and exclusion criteria comparable to other trials\nStudy protocol published on\u00a0clinicaltrials.gov\nConsideration of possible heterogeneity in patients and inter-hospital care in randomisation process, by using blocks of random allocation\nVery thorough concealment of sequence, randomisation, and blinding of those involved, which reduces systematic biases and strengthens the internal validity\n\nWeaknesses\n\nTrial was terminated (50% recruitment) due to futility \u2013 the trial was under-powered as the observed mortality rate was considerably less than the expected mortality rate\nSignificant number of patients lost post-randomisation which could introduce bias\nSignificant proportion of the terlipressin group required addition of norepinephrine and dopamine (86%) with the mean norepinephrine dose of 0.48 mcg/kg/min\nBaseline mean BP at randomisation was 67mmHg which suggests that the patients in this study may not have required vasopressor therapy\n\nData in the supplementary material showed that both groups had fluid intake of positive four litres per day in the first 2 days after randomisation\n\n\nShort term outcomes (28 day and hospital mortality) were assessed and therefore any long-term differences between treatment groups cannot be assessed\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial does not show a mortality benefit from using terlipressin compared to norepinephrine as a first-line vasopressor\nUse of terlipressin as first line led to significantly more serious adverse events, especially digital ischaemia\nI shall continue my current practice of using norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor, and add vasopressin in those patients with vasopressor-refractory septic shock\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Terlipressin
