Refractory Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest\nBelohlavek J. @jan_belohlavek JAMA 2022; 327:737 \u2013 747.doi:10.1001/jama.2022.1025\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with a witnessed refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) does early intra-arrest transport, extracorporeal CPR (ECPR) and invasive assessment improve neurological outcome at 180 days?\n\nBackground\n\nRefractory cardiac arrest is associated with poor clinical outcomes\nILCOR has incorporated ECPR into ALS guidelines in patients who are suspected to have a reversible cause of their arrest and in whom conventional measures are failing (a weak recommendation)\nThe ARREST trial published in 2020 showed that early ECMO facilitated resuscitation in those with refractory shockable rhythms improved survival to hospital discharge\n\nDesign\n\nSingle centre, randomised clinical trial\nStudy co-ordinator received automated SMS when ambulance dispatch initiated telephone assisted chest compressions\nOnce physician or paramedic on scene then telephone connection established to allow for randomisation\n\nRandomisation via web-based system\n\n\nCrossover was allowed:\n\nfrom standard to invasive strategy required request by emergency physician\n\n2 additional unsuccessful defibrillations were required\n\n\nfrom invasive to standard strategy allowed if continuing invasive measures was deemed to be futile\n\n\nPower calculations based on 10% favourable survival in standard strategy group; three scenarios for increased rates of favourable survival in invasive group were calculated:\n\n10% increase required 571 patients\n15% increase required 285 patients\n20% increase required 176 patients\n\n\nAppropriate ethical approval and consent protocols\nIndependent Data Safety and Monitoring board review after every 30 patients or 6 months (whichever came first)\n\nStudy terminated at recommendation of data safety and monitoring board as pre-specified limit for futility met\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre in Prague\nMarch 2013 \u2013 October 2020\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdults aged 18 \u2013 65\nWitnessed OHCA of presumed cardiac aetiology\n5 minute of ALS without ROSC\nUnconscious (GCS < 8)\nECPR team available at cardiac centre\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nUnwitnessed cardiac arrest\nPresumed non cardiac cause\nSuspected or confirmed pregnancy\nROSC achieved within 5 minutes of initial resuscitation\nObvious life limiting co-morbidities\nBleeding diathesis\nKnown CPC > 3\nSuspected or confirmed acute stroke\n\n\n358 without ROSC assessed for inclusion \u2013> 264 randomised\n\n8 excluded (7 due to consent not being obtained)\n124 to invasive strategy\n\n9 of these received standard strategy\n\n\n132 to standard strategy\n\n11 received invasive strategy\n\n\n94 excluded\n\nMainly due to logistical issues or presence of exclusion criteria\n29 due to physician preference and 4 reason unknown\n\n\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of invasive vs. standard group\n\nAge: median 59 vs 57\nMale: 82% vs 83%\nLocation of arrest:\n\nHome: 34% vs 26%\n\n\nInitial rhythm:\n\nVF: 58% vs 64%\nPEA: 17% vs 18%\nAsystole: 25% vs

34%\nTimings (median, mins):\n\nCollapse to EMS arrival: 8 vs 9\nCollapse to randomisation: 24 vs 26\nCollapse to hospital arrival: 49 vs 60\nCPR duration (to ROSC/death/ECLS): 58 vs

17% vs 11%\nAccepted for organ donation: 11% vs 2%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nInvasive bundle included the following:\n\nIntra-arrest nasal cooling initiated if feasible\n\nThis stopped in 2016 due to availability\n\n\nImmediately transferred to cath lab with CPR ongoing\nECLS if ROSC not achieved en-route or on admission if met criteria below:\n\nInclusion criteria for ECLS:\n\nNo ROSC, or ROSC with shock (SBP < 90 mmHg with moderate \u2013 high requirement for vasopressors\n< 60 minutes from time of initial call\nConsensus of ECLS team members\n\n\nExclusion criteria for ECLS:\n\nSigns of death or irreversible organ damage\nBleeding diathesis\nInadequate vessels for bifemoral cannulation\n\n\nECLS cannulation done in cath lab prior to invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures\nBi-femoral access\nAnticoagulation with heparin unless contra-indicated (APTT target 50 \u2013 70 seconds)\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard strategy bundle included:\n\nTreatment as per standard ALS guidelines\nIf ROSC achieved then transport to hospital initiated with early invasive strategy (e.g. coronary angiography) encouraged\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nUse of drugs, defibrillations en-route and other interventions during transport followed ERC guidelines\nThe use of a mechanical chest compression device was allowed at any point\nPost resuscitation care standardised in both groups\n\nUrgent TTE and whole body CT if feasible and indicated\nTTM\nAll other treatment, including withdrawal, complied with ERC guidelines\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary

0.09)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nComparing invasive vs. standard\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nCardiac Recovery at 30 days\n\n43.5% vs 34.1%\n\nAbsolute difference 9.4% (95% CI -2.5 to 21, p = 0.12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignificantly greater in invasive group:\n\nSurvival with minimal or no neurological impairment at 30 days\n\n30.6% vs 18.2%\n\nAbsolute difference 12.4% (95% CI 1.9 \u2013 22.7%, p = 0.02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe authors also looked at the rates of favourable survival (CPC 1+2) when stratified by duration of CPR (eFigure 4)\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong patients with refractory OHCA the bundle of early intra-arrest transport, ECPR and invasive assessment and treatment did not significantly improve survival with a neurologically favourable outcome compared with standard resuscitation\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised trial\n\nRandomising patients during active cardiac arrest management important to allow for comparison between invasive and standard approach to be made at approximately 25 minutes following collapse, as opposed to arrival at hospital\n\n\nIntention to treat analysis for primary outcome\nPre published statistical analysis plan\nAssessment of neurological outcome by single neurologist reduces variability when assessing CPC scores\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle centre study\n\nEach city would have to consider it\u2019s own logistics given transport to a single centre as in this study may take longer in larger cities\n\nThe time to ECLS in this study is longer than the ARREST trial, but similar to the Melbourne outcomes\u00a0that have just been recently published\n\n\n\n\nHigh rates of bystander CPR impressive, but important to consider when looking at overall neurological outcome\nPossibly underpowered due to early cessation\nHigher than expected favourable survival in standard group\n\n10% was expected\nPotential reasons for this may be due to the fact that all patients are being taken to a single centre with a high volume of cardiac arrest expertise, or it could be due to the Hawthorne effect\nOutside this trial, and in cities without designated cardiac arrest centres, then patients may be taken to hospitals with lower volumes and less experience in managing these patients \u2013 this could result in the favourable survival being lower in those that are managed as per the standard care arm\n\n\nCrossover allowed\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study did not show a statistically significant improvement in 180 day favourable neurological outcome with a hyperinvasive approach to refractory cardiac arrest\nHowever personally, the hypothesis generating secondary outcomes (30 day favourable survival) and subgroups (increased survival in invasive group in CPR > 45 minutes) in combination with other trials mean that the use of ECLS in refractory OHCA has valid support in this patient cohort\nThe implementation of ECLS programmes will need to consider each cities unique geographical and logistical constraints\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Effect of Intra-arrest Transport, Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, and Immediate Invasive Assessment and Treatment on Functional
