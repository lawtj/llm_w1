JAMA Surg 2022 doi:10.1001/jamasurg.2022.4299\nBackground\n\nBlunt chest wall trauma has high associated rates of morbidity and mortality\nRCTs have shown a reduced ICU length of stay in those requiring mechanical ventilation, however this has not been replicated in non-ventilated patients\n\nWhat did they do?\n\nBetween 2011 and 2018 in 15 US and Canadian trauma centres patients with either displaced rib fractures and a flail chest or non-flail chest injuries but severe chest wall deformity were randomised to operative fixation (within 96 hours of injury) or standard care (pain management, chest physiotherapy, ventilation as needed)\nPatients did not have to be invasively ventilated\nPatients who would likely require prolonged mechanical ventilation (severe TBI, severe airway injuries, severe pulmonary contusions) were excluded\nThe primary outcome was ventilator free days (to day 28)\n\nWhat did it show?\n\n211 patients were randomised\nBaseline characteristics including injury mechanism, injury severity score, number of rib fractures and associated thoracic injuries (pneumothorax, contusion) were similar between groups\n~40% (n=89) required mechanical ventilation at randomisation and a further~15% (n = 31) patients required mechanical ventilation after randomisation\nThe mean VFDs were 22.7 in the operative group and 20.6 in the non-operative group, with mean difference of 2.1 [95% CI -.03 to 4.5, p = 0.09]\nComplications including VAP, tracheostomy, empyema and death were similar between groups\nThe subgroup, comparing those mechanically ventilated at randomisation compared to those who were not, favoured rib fixation\n\nBoth an increase in VFD (with a mean difference of 2.8 days [95% CI 0.1 \u2013 5.5]) and shorter hospital length of stay (mean difference of 1.4 days [95% CI 0.9 \u2013 2.1]) was demonstrated\n\n\n\nHow does this fit into the other evidence?\n\nAlthough no difference in primary outcome was shown, this large MRCT seems to mirror the benefits shown in earlier trials (Marasco et al, Tanaka et al)\nRib fixation in mechanically ventilated patients shows short-term benefits (trend to shorter ventilation, and shorter hospital stays) however no longer-term patient focused outcomes have been demonstrated\n\nExternal Links\nOperative vs Nonoperative Treatment of Acute Unstable Chest Wall Injuries: A Randomized Clinical Trial\nRib Fixation: Who, What, When?\nMetadata\nSummary Author: George Walker\nSummary Date: 28th October 2022\nPeer Review Editor: Dave Slessor\n\u00a0\nImage: Pixabay/Rogue Pixie\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
