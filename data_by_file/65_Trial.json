Published online February 12. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.0930\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients older than 65-years with vasodilatory hypotension receiving vasopressors, does a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60-65mmHg compared with usual care impact mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nThe surviving sepsis campaign guidelines recommends targeting a MAP of at least 65mmHg in patients with septic shock. This recommendation has been controversial as it is based on expert opinion rather than evidence from clinical trials\nProtocolised management of sepsis and septic shock was made popular by Rivers in his landmark trial \u201cEarly goal-directed therapy in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock\u201d published in NEJM in 2001. Whilst this trial had several methodological flaws, it lead the way for other large sepsis trials such as the ARISE trial, ProMise and Process which de-emphasised in their conclusions certain aspects of the Rivers trial, such as haemoglobin and ScVO2 targets. These trials did not give firm conclusions on MAP targets\nSepsis has a huge global burden with 11 million deaths worldwide per annum. It also represents a high health cost and most countries necessitate ICU admission if patients require vasopressor support. It is therefore an important area of research to optimise therapy based on sound research evidence\nVasopressors are not without risk. They may reduce blood flow to vasoconstricted vascular beds (eg gut), effect cardiac and immune function. The sub-group of elderly patients in the SEPSISPAM trial had a higher mortality in those with higher MAP targets which led to the design and conduct of this trial\n\nDesign\n\nPragmatic, open, multicentre, parallel group, randomised clinical trial\n1:1 randomisation\nAllocation concealment achieved by a web-based randomisation system\nStratification by site with variable sized permuted blocks\n\nSetting\n\n65 ICUs in the UK\nPatients were randomised between July 3rd 2017 and March 16th 2019\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nPatients older than 65 years\n<6 hours since commencing vasopressor infusion\nPatients were adequately fluid resuscitated\nVasopressors were expected to continue for at least 6 hours more\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nContraindication to permissive hypotension\nVasopressors being used solely for bleeding, cardiac failure, post-CABGs vasoplegia\nTreatment for brain or spinal cord injury\nDeath perceived as imminent\nPrevious enrolment in 65 trial\n\n\n2600 patients were randomised. 2463 were included in the primary analysis (after 137 declined or withdrew consent)\nBaseline variables were well matched\nPatients or their next of kin provided consent. Deferred consent after randomisation was permitted\nRandomisation took place 24 hours a day, 7 days per week\nThe sample size calculation assumed a 90-day mortality of 35% in the usual care group (allowing a 2.5% withdrawal or loss to follow-up). The sample size of 2600 had a 90% power to detect a 6% absolute risk reduction in mortality in the permissive hypotensive group.\nAn interim analysis was conducted with pre-specified stopping rules in the case of harm or effectiveness\nIntention to treat analysis\nA p-value <0.05 was considered significant\nBaseline variables that were adjusted for included age, sex, chronic hypertension, chronic heart failure, atherosclerotic disease , dependence for ADLs, duration of vasopressors\n\nIntervention\n\nPermissive Hypotension\n\nThe permissive hypotensive group received vasopressors to target MAP of 60-65mmHg. MAP alarm limits were set on monitors to prompt dosing to be decreased or increased.\n\nNoradrenaline, vasopressin, terlipressin, phenylephrine, epinephrine, dopamine and metaraminol were considered as vasopressors\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard Care\n\nMAP targets were at the discretion of the treating ICU team\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nChoice of vasopressor and other treatments were at the discretion of the treating team\nThe allocated intervention was administered throughout the ICU stay\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Mortality at Day 90 \u2013 no significant difference\n\n500 (41%)/1221 in permissive hypotensive group vs 544 (43.8%)/1242 in usual care group (95% CI -6.75% to 1.05%; p=0.15)\nWhen adjusted for prespecified baseline variables, the OR for 90-day mortality was 0.82 (95% CI 0.68-0.98)\nThe survival curves diverged early after randomisation peaking around 1 month and then staying apart from that point onward (up to 12 months)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: no difference in any secondary outcome\n\nMortality at ICU discharge and hospital discharge\nDuration of survival\nDuration of Respiratory support\nDuration of Renal support\nICU LOS and Hospital LOS\nCognitive decline at 90 days and 1 year\nQuality of life at 90 days and 1 year\n\n\nSubgroup analysis: the reduction in mortality was more pronounced in the permissive hypotension group patients who were identified to be chronically hypertensive\u00a0and trended to greater survival the older you were\n\nComparing permissive hypotensive group vs. standard care group\n\nChronic hypertension subgroup \u2013 90-day mortality 38.2% vs. 44.3% (adjusted OR 0.67, 95% C.I. 0.49-0.85)\nPatients without chronic hypertension \u2013 90-day mortality:43.3% vs. 43.4%\n\n\n\n\nVasopressor dose: Permissive hypotension vs usual care\n\nmedian dose: 17.7mg vs 26.4mg (noradrenaline equivalent)\nmedian duration: 33 hours vs 38 hours (difference -5 hours, 95% CI -7.8 to -2.2)\n\n\nMAP data\n\nThere was a clear divergence between groups with mean and peak MAP values lower in the permissive hypotension group\n\nMean: 66.7 vs. 72.6\nPeak: 83 vs. 92\n\n\n\n\nCo-interventions: corticosteroid use, fluid balance and urine output were similar between the intervention and control arm\nSerious adverse events were similar between the two groups\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients older than 65 years receiving vasopressors for vasodilatory shock there was no difference in 90 day mortality but the point estimate for the primary outcome favours permissive hypotension\n\nStrengths\n\nAllocation concealment, intention to treat analysis, near complete follow-up\nGood internal and external validity\nLarge multi-centre trial in diverse ICU patient group\nClear divergence in MAP achieved\nRapid completion of trial with recruitment exceeding aims\nClinically significant outcomes assessed including cognition and quality of life\nIn contrast to the SEPSISPAM trial, patients with chronic hypertension in this trial were not more likely to develop renal dysfunction compared to the usual care group\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnblinded: the usual care group did not have a prescriptive MAP target, however, there was a clear separation in MAP achieved\nInterpretation of subgroups should be cautious (eg the group with chronic hypertension and the very elderly, as the trial was not powered to detect differences in the subgroups)\nWith a difference in mean MAP of only 5mmHg between the intervention and the control group, it is likely that a larger trial would be required to detect a significant mortality difference, if there is one\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIt appears safe to target a MAP of 60-65mmHg in elderly patients with vasodilatory shock and I would not hesitate to apply this to my patients\nThere is a suggestion of a potential mortality benefit with the use of permissive hypotension in patients that have chronic hypertension. Further trials are needed to test this hypothesis\nI look forward to a meta-analysis and potentially an update in the surviving sepsis campaign guidelines\n\nExternal Links\n\n65 Trial\nVimeo of presentation at #CCR20\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford \u2013 @celiabradford\nSummary date: 13th February 2020\nPeer-review editor: Dave Slessor\n\n\n"
