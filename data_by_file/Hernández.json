This limits the external validity.\nConsidering these were low risk patients there were a large number of patients that required re-intubation in the control group. This may limit the external validity to centres that have a lower re-intubation rate in low risk patients.\nThere were some baseline differences between the intervention and the control group. There was a significantly lower incidence of neurological co-morbidity in the high flow nasal oxygen group. This confounding variable may have introduced bias. The length of mechanical ventilation was shorter, although this did not reach statistical significance, in the high flow group. As the authors reported that successfully extubated patients had a shorter duration of ventilation, this may have also introduced bias.\nIn\u00a0clinicaltrials.gov\u00a0the primary outcome was planned to be measured at 3 months, where as in the paper it was\u00a0measured at 72 hours. A number of secondary outcomes were also added after the planned analysis was published on\u00a0clinicaltrials.gov\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis multi-centre randomised controlled trial found that in patients that are low risk for requiring re-intubation, the use of high flow nasal oxygen compared with conventional oxygen therapy reduced the risk of re-intubation at 72 hours. However, due to some baseline differences, and some concerns over the external validity I would want to see further trials before this becomes routine practice.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[abstract]\u00a0Effect of Postextubation High-Flow Nasal Cannula vs Conventional Oxygen Therapy on Reintubation in Low-Risk Patients A Randomized Clinical Trial\n[full text]\u00a0Effect of Postextubation High-Flow Nasal Cannula vs Conventional Oxygen Therapy on Reintubation in Low-Risk Patients A Randomized Clinical Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0Fragility index\n[further reading]\u00a0PulmCrit \u2013 Update on post-extubation high-flow nasal cannula to reduce reintubation\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: David Slessor\nSummary date: 16th March 2016\nPeer-review editor: Adrian Wong\n\n\n"
