DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1812379\nClinical Question\n\nIn post out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients treated with targeted temperature management, does the use of empirical antibiotics prevent early ventilator-associated pneumonia?\n\nBackground\n\nRates of survival to hospital discharge and good neurological outcomes post out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) remain poor\nDespite questions remaining around targeted temperature management, it aims to improve neurological outcomes in this group of patients\n\u00a0The potential benefits of temperature management need to be balanced against its risk including increased risk of secondary infection\n\nDesign\n\nMulticentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled\nRandomisation within 6 hours after return of spontaneous circulation\nRandomisation by secure, computer-generated, web-response system in a 1:1 ratio\nStratified according to centre; using fixed block size of four units\nPatients, care providers and members of adjudication committee were blinded to allocation\nSample size calculation identified 192 patients were required, based on:\n\nBaseline incidence of VAP rate on day 7 as 68%, mortality of 15%\n25% lower incidence of early VAP in intervention group\n2-sided, 5% type 1 error rate\n90% power\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n16 ICUs in France\nAugust 2014 to September 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: aged over 18, on ICU post OOHCA due to shockable rhythm, targeted temperature management 32 to 34\u00b0C\nExclusion: OOHCA with non-shockable rhythm, in-hospital cardiac arrest, on-going pneumonia, gross aspiration identified during tracheal intubation AND confirmed by presence of lung infiltrates on chest radiograph, pregnancy, previous lung disease precluding accurate interpretation of chest radiographs, the use of extracorporeal life support, ongoing antibiotic therapy or during the week before admission, known chronic colonisation with multidrug-resistant bacteria, known allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics, contraindication to amoxicillin or clavulanate, predictable decision of early limitation, participation in another trial within 30 days\n1116 screened, 198 randomised, 194 included for final analysis\nCharacteristics of the groups (Intervention vs Control)\n\nAge: 61 vs 60 years\nSex: 77% vs 84% male\nOOHCA characteristics\n\nWitnessed: 95% vs 95%\nLow-flow time: 20 vs 18 mins\nTime to intubation: 20 vs 22 mins\n\n\nSuspected aspiration: 3 vs 8\nBaseline temperature: 35 vs 36\u00b0C\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n2-day antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanate (1gm and 200mg), intravenously, three times a day\n\nControl\n\nSaline injections intravenously, three times a day\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nSedation protocol and use of neuromuscular blocking agents were left at treating clinician discretion\nAny method of targeted temperature management of 32 to 34\u00b0C for 24 to 36 hours\nAll patients who had secondary infection received antibiotic therapy according to local guidelines\nRoutine use of bundles for prevention of VAP and daily oral care were highly recommended\nVAP was confirmed using standardised criteria from 2010 Food and Drug Administration guidance \u2013 link which relies on clinical, radiological & microbiological criteria (patients had to meet all 3 types)\nSuspected VAP cases were reviewed by adjudication committee composed of three senior intensivists, who assessed clinical parameters including:\n\nClinical Pulmonary Infection Score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score\nChest radiographs\nQuantitative sampling of lower respiratory tract (either bronchoalveolar lavage or endotracheal aspiration)\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Rate of\u00a0 early (within 7 days) ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)\n\nLower incidence in intervention group (19% v 34%; hazard ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.92, P=0.03)\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nNo difference between intervention and control group in:\n\nRate of late VAP\nOther nosocomial infections\n28 day mortality\nIntestinal acquisition of multi-drug resistant bacteria\nPercentage of days with antibiotic use outside of trial intervention but during ICU stay\nLength of ICU stay\nNumber of ventilator-free days until day 28\n\n\nCost consequence analysis\n\nNot presented in main paper but rather in Supplementary Material\n\nData available for 94 patients in each group showed significant lower cost in antibiotic compared to control group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients treated with targeted temperature management after resuscitation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests with shockable rhythm, the use fo a 2 day treatment course of amoxicillin-clavulanate resulted in a lower incidence of early VAP than placebo\n\nStrengths\n\nRelevant clinical question and hypothesis\nMulticentre, randomised and blinded\nTreatment strategies in line with known microbiological data on European ICU pathogen characteristics\n\nWeaknesses\n\nKey exclusions; non-shockable rhythm (which make up the majority of cardiac arrest rhythms) and suspected aspiration/co-existing lung disease (which confer higher risk of VAP)\nIncidence of early VAP less than half that used for power calculation\nChallenges of diagnosing VAP highlighted\n\n25% of VAP cases initially reported by investigators were not subsequently confirmed during adjudication\n78% agreement between two adjudicators, resulting in decision made by referee adjudicator\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial shows that the use of a short course of antibiotics in OOHCA patients due to a shockable rhythm resulted in a lower rate of VAP without improvement in mortality or ICU length of stay and supports the findings of previous trials\nMy current practice is to start a short course of antibiotic in patients who have clear signs of aspiration but not in others; I will be reviewing this with my colleagues in light of this trial\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Prevention of Early Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia after Cardiac Arrest\n[further reading]\u00a0Early pneumonia and timing of antibiotic therapy in patients after nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest\n[further reading]\u00a0Prophylactic antibiotics are associated with a lower incidence of pneumonia in cardiac arrest survivors treated with targeted temperature management\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Adrian Wong\nSummary date: 28/11/2019\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
