J Am Soc Nephrol 29:Dec 2017 doi:10.1681ASN.2017060694\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult critically ill patients, with acute kidney injury, does early initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) compared to delayed initiation of RRT reduce the composite endpoint of\u00a0MAKE365; consisting of death, RRT and persistent renal dysfunction at one year?\n\nBackground\n\nThe optimal timing for initiation of RRT in patients with AKI is unknown.\nThis trial looked at the 1 year outcomes of patients enrolled in the ELAIN trial.\nThe ELAIN trial examined 90 day mortality of patients who were randomised to receive early RRT (within 8 hours of reaching KDIGO Stage 2) or delayed RRT (within 12 hours of reaching KDIGO Stage 3) or if they had an absolute indication for initiation of RRT.\nThe ELAIN trial showed improved 90 day mortality (early vs delayed RRT) of 39.3% vs 54.7%,\u00a0shorter duration of RRT (9 days vs 25 days), reduced ventilator time (125 hrs vs 181 hrs) and reduced hospital LOS (51 days vs 82 days).\nThis trial aimed to determine if the beneficial intervention of early RRT was sustained at the 1 year mark.\nIt is known that the mortality and morbidity after receiving RRT in ICU is high. For example, the POST-RENAL (prolonged outcomes after kidney injury requiring dialysis in the ICU) study suggested that at 4 years more than 60% of patients who had received dialysis in ICU were now dead and more than 5% of those who survived required ongoing dialysis.\nThe STAART-AKI trial is currently recruiting. This trial is larger than ELAIN as it is aiming to recruit 2866 patients (vs 231 for ELAIN). It is comparing early RRT vs standard care. This study includes ICU adults with renal dysfunction who have i) A doubling of baseline creatinine OR ii) Cr >354umol/L OR iii) UO<0.5ml/kg/hr for 12 hours. The primary outcome is 90 day mortality and independence from RRT.\n\nDesign\n\nThe ELAIN trial was randomised, unblinded, single-centre with complete follow-up. Patients were allocated 1:1 for early vs late dialysis stratified by hemodynamic SOFA score.\nFor patients discharged alive at 90 days, telephone calls were made to the general practitioner, subject or family member to determine if the patient was alive, if they were requiring RRT or if they had persistent renal dysfunction (defined as 25% decline in eGFR compared with baseline calculated with the Cockroft-Gault formula)\nIn addition the relation of inflammatory biomarkers (collected at ICU Day 0 and Day 3) to the MAKE365 outcome was analysed.\n1 year outcomes were available for all but one patient\n\nSetting\n\nUniversity Hospital Munster, Gemany\nELAIN recruited from August 2013 to\u00a0December 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: must have met all five of the following\n\n1.

The fragility index of the original ELAIN study was only 3.\nThe primary outcome was not included in the trial protocol. The only 1 year outcome pre-specified in the trial protocol was all cause mortality.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe results suggest that early RRT, in predominantly post-operative patients with Stage 2 AKI, positively influences mortality and other patient centred outcomes at 1 year.\nRenal replacement therapy does carry cost and some risk to patients, so although this encourages me to use RRT early, I await the results of the STAART-AKI trial, which will be invaluable in answering the important question of the optimal timing of RRT in critically ill patients.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Long-Term Clinical Outcomes after Early Initiation of RRT in Critically Ill Patients with AKI\n[further reading]\u00a0Effect of Early vs Delayed Initiation of Renal Replacement Therapy on Mortality in Critically Ill Patients With Acute Kidney Injury: The ELAIN RCT\u00a0\n[further reading] Early vs Late RRT: editorial TBL\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @Celia Bradford\nSummary date: 9/2/18\nPeer-review editors: Segun Olusanya\u00a0@iceman_ex\u00a0\u00a0and @davidslessor\n\n\n"
