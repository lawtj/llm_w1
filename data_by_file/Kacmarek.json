Critical Care Medicine; 2016;44(1)32-42,\u00a0DOI: 10.1097/CCM.0000000000001383\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with ARDS does open-lung ventilation compared with ARDSnet ventilation improve 60 day mortality?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nWeb based randomisation\nStratified according to centre, age and APACHE II score\nPower calculation: 600 patients would need to be randomised to give an 80% power, with a 5% false positive rate, to detect an absolute risk reduction of 12% from a baseline mortality of 45% in the control group\nTrial terminated early due to low recruitment\n\nSetting\n\n20 intensive care units, majority in Spain\nEnrolment began September 2007\nPatient follow-up completed August 2013. Unclear when last patient recruited\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nAdult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, defined according to the American-european consensus\u00a0conference\nPaO2/FiO2 <200mmHg\nMechanical ventilation for <96 hours\nRecruited into trial within 48 hours of meeting above criteria\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nWeight <35kg predicted body weight\nBMI >50\nIntubation as a result of an acute exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease, asthma, cystic fibrosis\u00a0etc\nAcute brain injury or intracranial pressure >18mmHg\nImmunosuppressed and had received\u00a0chemotherapy or radiotherapy in previous 2 months\nSevere cardiac disease (NYHA class 3 or 4; acute coronary\u00a0syndrome or persistent ventricular tachyarrhythmias)\nHigh risk of mortality from other causes (Age >80, severe neurological damage, cancer patients in terminal stages)\n\n\n200 patients randomised\nFor 12-36 hours post-randomisation all patients ventilated according to ARDSnet protocol and then reassessed to ensure met definition for moderate/severe ARDS\n\n\nComparing intervention vs. control group \u2013 no significant differences in baseline characteristics\n\n\nAge: 52.2 vs. 53.4\nAPACHE II score 18 vs. 17\nPneumonia: 54% vs. 53%\nPaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio: 121 vs. 114\nTidal volume \u00a0ml/kg predicted weight (Vt): 7.4 vs. 7.1\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nOpen-lung ventilation (Ventilation strategy using recruitment manoeuvre (RM) followed by decremental PEEP trial), n=99\nFirst ensured patient apnoeic and haemodynamically stable\nThen performed\n\nRecruitment manoeuvre\n\nUsing pressure control ventilation\nPEEP initially set at 25cm H2O, pressure control at 15cm H2O, inspiratory time 3 seconds, I:E 1:1, RR 10\nAfter 5 breaths pressure control increased to 20cm H2O for 5 breaths\nThen PEEP increased to 30cm H20 for final 20 breaths\n\n\n\n\nFollowed by decremental PEEP trial\n\nVentilated with volume assist/control, Vt 4-6ml/kg, PEEP 25, ventilatory rate set at level prior to recruitment manoeuvre\nFollowing 3 minute stabilisation period, dynamic compliance [Vt / (peak pressure \u2013 PEEP)] calculated\nPEEP then decreased in steps of 2cm H2O, until PEEP level corresponding with maximum compliance identified\nRecruitment manoeuvre performed again, and PEEP then set at maximum compliance PEEP + 3cm H2O (Maximum 25)\n\n\n\n\nVentilation mode changed to pressure assist/control to set peak inspiratory pressure <30cm H2O, Vt 4-8ml/kg. If Vt <5ml/kg predicted body weight, plateau pressure allowed to exceed 30cm H20.\nPEEP not modified for 24 hours and only when FiO2 decreased to 0.4. PEEP decreased at a maximum rate of 2cm H2O every 8 hours\nIf inability to reduce FiO2 to 0.4 at 24 hours post recruitment manoeuvre then above process repeated. Consider using PEEP level of 40cm H2O and peak pressure of up to 60cm H20 for\u00a0RM\nMaximum of 3\u00a0RM\u00a0allowed per 24 hours\nMean of 2.57\u00a0RM\u00a0performed per patient\n10 patients did not have\u00a0RM\u00a0performed as too unstable. In 7 patients\u00a0RM\u00a0stopped due to\u00a0hypotension. In 3 of these patients RM continued post fluid bolus.\n\nControl\n\nOriginal ARDS-net protocol ventilation\nVentilator mode: volume cycled assist/control\nPEEP and FiO2 adjusted based on ARDSnet table\n\n\nIn both groups\n\n\nVt target 6ml/kg predicted body weight\nPlateau pressure target \u2264 30cm H2O\nArterial pH target \u2265 7.30 and \u2264 7.45\nAll patients assessed daily for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) based on ARDSnet criteria\nIf met criteria had 30-60 minute breathing trial. If passed SBT extubated unless contraindication\nPost-extubation, patients treated with non-invasive ventilation for 24-48 hours until stable or requiring re-intubation if: age >65 years, hypercapnic post extubation (>45mmHg), with an ineffective cough and excessive secretions, with >1 chronic organ failure, upper airway obstruction, APACHE II >12 on day of extubation\nProne positioned allowed in patients failing to respond to either protocol (4% in intervention group vs. 10% in control group)\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: all-mortality death at 60 days \u2013 no significant difference\n\n29% in intervention group vs. 33% in control group, p=0.18\n\n\nSecondary outcomes \u2013 comparing intervention vs. control groups\n\nICU mortality \u2013 no significant difference\n\n25% vs. 30%, p=0.53\n\n\nVentilator free days \u2013 no significant difference\n\n8 vs. 7, p=0.53\n\n\n\n\nPost-hoc analysis\n\nPaO2/FiO2 ratio at 24 hours post randomisation \u2013 significantly improved in open-lung group\n\n199mmHg vs. 136mmHg, p<0.0001\n\n\nRespiratory variables at day 3\n\nPlateau pressure: 26.2 vs. 24.5, p<0.05\nPEEP: 14.3 vs. 10.7, p<0.01\nDriving pressure: 11.4 vs. 13.6, p<0.01\nFiO2: 0.4 vs. 0.6, p<0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdverse events\n\nMajor adverse events \u2013 no significant difference\n\nPneumothorax 6% vs 8%, p=0.78\nCardiac arrests: 8% vs. 6%, p=0.58\nMinor transient events \u2013 no significant difference\nHypotension: 35% vs. 29%, p=.45\nDesaturation: 34% vs. 22%, p=0.06\nPrimary cause of death : comparing intervention to control group\nProgressive respiratory failure: 12% vs. 33%, p=0.11\nSeptic shock: 40% vs. 10%, p=0.01\nMultiple organ failure: 16% vs. 33%, p=0.22\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nOpen lung ventilation significantly improved oxygenation, lung mechanics and driving pressure, and did not adversely affect duration of ventilatory support, mortality or adverse events\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised\nMulti-centre\nStabilisation period ensured that all patients had moderate/severe ARDS\nStandardised ventilation strategy\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOn day 1 more patients in intervention group vs. control group received neuromuscular blocking agents, and this has been shown to decrease mortality in the\u00a0ACURASYS Study\nStudy under powered and stopped early\nProtocol violations in 13% of intervention group and 12% of control group\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with moderate-severe ARDS, the use of open-lung ventilation compared with ARDSnet ventilation improved oxygenation without any significant adverse affects. There was no significant mortality difference, but the study was under powered to detect this. Further, larger trials are required that control for the use of early neuromuscular blockers and the use of proning. Whilst waiting for these trials I will use recruitment\u00a0manoeuvres with a decremental PEEP trial with the aim of improving oxygenation.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0 Open Lung Approach for the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Pilot, Randomized Controlled Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0LITFL: Open Lung Approach To Ventilation\n[Trial protocol]\u00a0Clinicaltrials.gov\n[Podcast from state of the art]\u00a0Year in review: mechanical ventilation\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Dave Slessor\nSummary date: 22nd February 2016\nPeer-review editor: Adrian Wong\n\n\n"
