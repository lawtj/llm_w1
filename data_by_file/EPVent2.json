JAMA February 2019; DOI:10.1001/jama.2019.0555\nClinical Question\n\nDoes titrating positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) with the use of an esophageal balloon to estimate pleural pressure improve outcomes compared with an empirical high PEEP \u2013FiO2 strategy in patients with moderate \u2013 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\n\nBackground\n\nDespite decades of research, the clinical benefits of higher PEEP and the best method to titrate PEEP for patients with ARDS remain unclear https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.201610-2035CI\nPlateau pressure (Pplt) measured during an inspiratory hold is typically used to approximate alveolar distending pressure\nThe true distending pressure of a collapsible structure (like an alveolus) is defined by its transmural pressure (pressure inside minus pressure outside). For the lung, this pressure is termed the transpulmonary pressure (PL) and is defined by airway pressure minus pleural pressure\nFor many mechanically ventilated patients, the contribution of pleural pressure to PL is minimal and Pplt serves as a reasonable approximation of alveolar stress. However, in patients with chest wall deformities, obesity, significant ascites, etc., Pplt may be an unreliable surrogate for PL\nEsophageal manometry using an esophageal balloon provides an approximation of pleural pressure through the measurement of esophageal pressure (PES) and may provide a mechanism to tailor PEEP to a patient\u2019s lung mechanics\nThis approach was studied in a previous single-center trial (the EPVent study) which was stopped early due to a significantly higher PaO2/FiO2 in the intervention arm (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0708638). However, the use of a low PEEP strategy in the control group may have biased the trial towards a positive result\n\nDesign\n\nMulticenter prospective randomized phase II clinical trial\nBlinding not performed given the nature of the intervention\nRandomization performed using a random sorting algorithm through central web-based software using a balanced randomization scheme.

This does not reflect usual care at most institutions. While the investigators did not design the control arm of this trial to reflect usual care, the very high PEEP \u2013 FiO2 table used does have implications for the generalizability of the study\u2019s findings to usual practice\nPES-guided PEEP titration is, in theory, most informative in patients with significantly elevated pleural pressure. This trial enrolled a heterogeneous cohort of patients with moderate to severe ARDS, many of whom likely did not have significant issues with chest wall elastance. It is possible that if the trial targeted patients with abnormal pleural pressure (e.g. significant obesity, ascites, chest wall deformities, etc.), the results may have been different\nThe low utilization of prone positioning (only 4 patients total) is at odds with the strong recommendation for proning in patients with severe ARDS https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.201703-0548ST. The PROSEVA trial was published while this trial was recruiting\nThe trial was underpowered for many of its secondary endpoints. As an example, the 95% confidence interval for 28-day mortality includes both significant benefit and significant harm (-11.1% \u2013 14.6%) with PES-guided therapy\nPES measurements are only obtained at a single point in the mid-esophagus and therefore may be insensitive to regional heterogeneity in pleural pressure\nAdditional sedation and neuromuscular blockade could be administered to facilitate PL It is not clear how frequently this was needed. Trial protocols which require deeper levels of sedation and neuromuscular blockade are likely to be increasingly seen as not reflective of best practice https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1901686\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nRoutine use of PES-guided PEEP titration appears to offer little benefit over the use of empirical high PEEP \u2013 FiO2 in patients with moderate to severe ARDS\nThis trial does not inform whether either strategy is superior to a less aggressive PEEP \u2013FiO2 approach or one which prioritizes the early use of prone positioning\nThe physiologic rationale for PES monitoring and the concept of PL are important to understand. Whether they can be used to advance the care of patients with ARDS remains to be seen\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Effect of Titrating Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) With an Esophageal Pressure\u2013Guided Strategy vs an Empirical High PEEP-FIO2 Strategy on Death and Days Free From Mechanical Ventilation Among Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.
