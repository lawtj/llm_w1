In Europe 37% of all injury-related mortality is caused by or associated with TBI\nOf those who have a severe TBI (GCS < 8 on presentation), almost half will have an unfavourable outcome (death, vegetative state or severe disability)\nHypothermia has been touted as a treatment to reduce secondary injury following TBI as there is scientific rationale and experimental evidence that neuronal damage at the cellular and molecular level is highly temperature sensitive and that hypothermia is neuroprotective.\nSeveral studies have been conducted with mixed results. A RCT of 392 patients with severe TBI treated with hypothermia, with the body temperature reaching 33 degrees C within eight hours after injury, showed no improvement in outcomes. There was concern that the induction of hypothermia was not rapid enough to be neuroprotective in this study\nA meta-analysis of the highest quality clinical trials of hypothermia in severe TBI was conducted by the Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) which reported a significant increase in long term favourable neurological outcomes (Relative Risk (RR) 1.46, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.12 to 1.92, p=0.006\nEUROtherm 3235 looked at TBI patients with elevated ICP. This demonstrated a greater risk of death and worse neurological outcomes in survivors managed with therapeutic hypothermia compared to standard therapy\u00a0\u00a0\nThe POLAR RCT was designed to rapidly induce hypothermia at the pre-hospital/early hospital stage with the idea that early and sustained cooling may offer benefit to these patients\n\n\n\nDesign\n\n\n\nMulticentre, partially-blinded, randomised-controlled trial, block randomisation, allocation concealment with sealed envelopes\n1:1 assignment to the control arm:cooling arm\nRandomisation occurred by paramedics (pre-hospital) or emergency department staff. There was stratification to ensure equal allocation of randomisation site (PH or ED) between control and cooling arms\nStratification was also based on geographical location\nOutcome assessors were blinded but bedside clinical staff were not\nThe study had an 82% power to detect an Absolute Risk Increase of 15% of favourable neurological outcome (2-sided p=0.05)\n\nBased on this, 364 patients would be needed\nHowever, the study sample size aim was increased to 510 to account for expected loss to follow-up, cessation of hypothermia due to complications and incorrect paramedic diagnosis\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n14 institutes in 6 countries (Australia, France, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Switzerland, New Zealand)\nRecruitment commenced in 2010 and ended in November 2017 with final patient follow-up in May 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: blunt trauma with clinical diagnosis of severe TBI and GCS<9, age 18-60 (as best estimated if unknown), intubated patient (or imminent intubation)\nExclusion: >3hrs since injury, >2.5hrs transport to hospital, SBP<90mmHg, HR>120/min, cardiac arrest at scene, GCS 3 + fixed pupils, clinically significant bleeding, pregnancy\n510 patients\nExcellent balance of baseline characteristics; Marshal score, GCS, Probability of unfavourable outcome [IMPACT-TBI score; validated score that takes account of CT findings, age, motor score, pupil response, hypoxia and hypotension]\nBaseline: 80% were men, 45% of patients had high blood alcohol levels, GCS mean = 6, Mean age = 35.\n\nIntervention\n\nCooling Arm 260 patients (47% pre-hospital)\n\nIV infusion of 4\u00b0C 0.9% saline to achieve a target temp of 35\u00b0C (volume administered 1-2L at 100ml/min depending on intubation status) \u2013 delivered in pre-hospital or ED depending on site of randomisation\nMaintenance of low core temperature achieved using a temperature control console and surface temperature control vests/leg wraps/blankets applied to approximately 40% of the body and titrated to achieve a core temperature of 33\u00b0C\nTemperature was maintained for 3 days (up to 7 days)\nRewarming individualised according to ICP \u2013 performed slowly to avoid instability\n\n\nThe time from injury to the initial temperature target of 35\u00b0C was a median of 2.5 hours, and for 186 patients (71.5%), the time to reach the final temperature target of 33\u00b0C was a median of 10.1 hours\nClear and significant separation in temperatures achieved between cooling and control arm\n\nControl\n\nNormothermia Arm 240 patients (42% pre-hospital)\n\nTemperature of 36.5-37.5\u00b0C will be targeted with paracetamol or cooling vests applied if the temperature exceeds 38\u00b0C\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll other management was in keeping with local practice\n80% had ICP monitors\nSimilar use of osmotic agents\nNoradrenaline dose much greater in the hypothermia group\nBradycardia 18.8% (hypothermia) vs 4.2% (normothermia)\n20-25% patients had craniotomy, only 3% had decompressive craniotomy\nNo difference in fluid balance\nICP; no significant difference between the 2 groups\n\nICP problems did not occur in rewarming phase in the hypothermia group\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\u00a0The proportion of favourable neurological outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Score Extended: GOSE 5 to 8) at six months following injury\n\n48.8% (hypothermia group) vs 49.1% (normothermia group)\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nGOSE at 6 months using proportional odds model\u2026 no difference\nGOSE at 6 months using \u2018sliding dichotomy\u2019 method\u2026 no difference\nAs treated analysis\u2026 similar to intention to treat analysis\nMortality at hospital discharge and 6 months .. no difference\nAdverse events; bleeding (no difference), infection (pneumonia in per-protocol analysis 70% vs 57%)\nNo evidence of harm to skin from the cooling vests\nSurgically removed haematoma patients; no difference\nMean mechanical ventilation days: one day longer in hypothermia group\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThere is absolutely no sign in this trial that early and sustained prophylactic hypothermia improves neurological outcome\nThis trial puts hypothermia to bed!\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre, RCT, allocation concealment, follow-up, intention to treat analysis, low loss to follow-up\nHypothermia induced rapidly meaning that the impact on secondary injury was optimised\nBlinding of outcome assessors\nThis is the largest and best conducted trial addressing this question\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNot blinded at the bedside, but outcome assessors blinded\nA high proportion of patients randomised to hypothermia did not reach target temperature:\n\n19% were assessed not to be suitable and withdrawn\n13% did not reach 33\u00b0C\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI will aim for normothermia in my patients with TBI\nSignificantly: hypothermia did not improve 6 month outcome, but increased pneumonia, ventilation days, bradycardia and noradrenaline use\nHypothermia did not reduce ICP\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0POLAR\n[further reading]\u00a0Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines\n[further reading]\u00a0POLAR trial protocol\u00a0\nTwitter: search \u201c#LIVES2018 POLAR\u201c\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @celiabradford\nSummary date: October 25 7pm\nPeer-review editor: Dave Slessor\n\n\n"
