Intensive Care Medicine 2017; first published on line 14th Feb.\u00a0DOI 10.1007/s00134-016-4669-9\nClinical Question\n\nAmong relatives who died in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), does a condolence letter from a clinician, compared to no condolence letter, effect grief symptoms?\n\nBackground\n\nStudies have shown that over half of bereaved relatives experience grief symptoms, characterised by variably combined symptoms of anxiety, depression, stress and complicated grief\nTwo previous RCT\u2019s have shown that improving communication during end-of-life care alleviated grief symptoms in relatives of patients who had died in the ICU\nThis RCT evaluates the effect of a simple implementation, a condolence letter, to try and improve communication and grief symptoms after death\n\nDesign\n\nMulticenter randomised control trial\nRandomisation occurred with 24 hours of the patient\u2019s death\nCentralised internet-based randomisation procedure was used\nStratified according to study centre with concealed sized permuted blocks\nSingle relative per patient was included\nInformed consent was sought in the hours following patient\u2019s death\n\nthe patient information sheet did not specify the nature of the intervention, but that a strategy to improve communication was being evaluated\n\n\nIntention to treat analysis\nPower calculation: 240 patients would give the study 90% power to detect a \u00a0decrease in the prevalence of anxiety and depression from 60% to 42%, and a 30% decrease in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Score\n\nSetting\n\n22 ICUs in France\nDec 2014 \u2013 Oct 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: age at least 18 years; at least one family visit prior to death; and an ICU stay of at least 2 days\nExclusion:\u00a0pregnant and family not fluent in French\n242 relatives of patients that died in ICU\nBaseline characteristics were similar for key confounders apart from:\n\nmore of the follow up interviews occurred with spouses in the intervention group (38.5% vs 32.3%)\ninterviews with children were similar; \u2018others\u2019 were higher in the control group (26.2% vs 22%)\nmore family-clinician or intra-team conflicts in the control group, although small numbers 13 vs 9\nmore patients were intubated at time of death in the intervention group (58.5% vs 54.6%), and sedated at time of death (78.9% vs 76.5%)\npreferred role of relatives of being only informed of end-of-life decision, lower in intervention group 25% vs 34%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nCondolence letter\n\nhandwritten by the physician and nurse in charge\n\ncovered the following 5 domains: recognise the death and name the deceased; mention a personal impression of the deceased; recognise the family member; offer help; and express sympathy\n\n\nsent by standard mail 15 days after the patient death\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNo condolence letter\n\nIn both groups\n\nSymptom control, timing of communication at the end-of-life and implementation of treatment-limitation decisions were at the clinician\u2019s discretion\nAfter randomisation, the clinicians recorded all reactions or feedback (telephone calls, letters, visits, or other) from the relatives within 4 months following death\nTelephone interviews with family members occurred at 30 days and 6 months after the patient\u2019s death. These were conducted by psychologists, sociologists, and research nurses blinded to study group\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: at one month. Expressed as median (25th-75th percentile) unless stated otherwise\n\nHospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)\u00a0Score: higher in the intervention group but did not reach statistical significance based on P value\n\n16 [10-22] vs 14 [8-21]; P=0.36, mean difference 0.77 (95% C.I. -1.7 to 3.3)\n\n\nHADS-depression sub-scale scores: higher in the intervention group but no significant difference\n\n8 [4-12] vs 6 [2-12]; P=0.10, mean difference 1.1 (95% C.I. -0.5 to 2.6)\n\n\nRelatives with symptoms of depression (sub-scale score >8): higher in the intervention group but no significant difference\n\n56% vs 42.4%; P=0.054, relative risk = 0.76 (95% C.I. 0.57-1.00)\n\n\nHADS-anxiety sub-scale scores: no significant difference\n\n7 [4-11] vs 7 [4-12], P=0.92\n\n\nRelatives with symptoms of anxiety (sub-scale score>8): no significant difference\n\n47.7% vs. 45.5%, P=0.97\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\u00a0at 6 months, and were all worse in the intervention group. Expressed as median (25th-75th percentile) unless stated otherwise\n\nHADS score\n\n13 [6\u201319] vs. 9 [4\u201317]; P=0.04\n\n\nHADS-depression sub-scale scores\n\n6 [2\u201310] vs. 3 [1\u20138]; P=0.01\n\n\nRelatives with symptoms of depression (sub-scale score >8)\n\n37% vs. 25%; P=0.05\n\n\nImpact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) score\n\n28 [15-38] vs 20 [10-37]; P=0.09\n\n\nRelatives with significant post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related symptoms (IES-R \u226526)\n\n52.4% vs 37.1%; P=0.03\n\n\nInventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) score\n\n16 [8-30] vs 13 [4-27]; P=0.07\n\n\nRelatives at high risk for complicated grief (ICG \u226525)\n\n38% vs 27%; P=0.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\nFeedback was received from 55 (44.7%) intervention- group relatives and 8 (6.7%) controls; P < 0.0001\n\nOf the 55 intervention-group relatives who gave feedback, 50 did so to thank the clinician for the condolence letter\nNo relatives complained about the condolence letter\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn relatives of patients who died in the ICU, a condolence letter failed to alleviate grief symptoms and may have worsened depression and PTSD-related symptoms\n\nStrengths\n\nA relevant\u00a0and important study evaluating the impact of a simple measure to support families of patients that have recently died on ICU\nMulticentre\nRCT\u00a0including university and non-university hospitals\nInterviewers were blinded\nAll letters complied with the study guidelines\nTrial registered on clinicaltrial.gov\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAll participating ICUs were in France, which may limit the general applicability of the findings, as end-of-life care and bereavement follow-up vary widely across countries\nAll ICUs involved had a special interest in family-centred care\nIntervention was not standardised. Whilst the clinicians followed guidelines for the letter, they were otherwise free to write what they wanted to\nThe psychological status of the relatives at the time they received the condolence letter was not evaluated\nThe outcome measure were assessed at one and six months. This may have been too short to demonstrate any longer term benefit\n14% relatives (34 patients) did not complete the HADS at one month\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis is an important study evaluating a simple intervention to try and improve grief symptoms amongst family members. It unexpectedly showed that condolence letters may increase depression and PTSD symptoms amongst family members at 6 months\nGrief is a complex process with many confounders, including individual adaptive response and external influences. These nuances and impact are difficult to evaluate\nOur current departmental policy of sending out condolence cards will continue. However, we will review the timing, content and potential deleterious effects\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of a condolence letter on grief symptoms among relatives of patients who died in the ICU: a randomized clinical trial\n[further reading]\u00a0A communication strategy and brochure for relatives of patients dying in the ICU.
