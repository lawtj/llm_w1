Ain-Shams J Anaesthesiol 2016;9:319-24. doi:10.4103/1687-7934.189091\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients with severe sepsis, does methylene blue compared to vasopressin reduce noradrenaline requirement and increase blood pressure?\n\nDesign\n\nSingle centre\nRandomised controlled trial\n\u201cSingle blinded\u201d but doesn\u2019t state who or how\nScreening and recruitment method not specified\nRandom number tables used for allocation therefore poor concealment\nPowered at 90% with significance defined at 0.05 if 40 patients recruited\n\nPrimary outcome not define\nSource of pilot or background date not provided\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nSingle academic tertiary Intensive Care Unit in Egypt\n2010 to 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Within 72 hours of severe sepsis or within 24 hours of septic shock\n\nAs defined by ACCP/SCCM consensus criteria on sepsis\nRequiring Noradrenaline 0.2 \u00b5g/kg/min to maintain MAP 70-90 mmHg\n\n\nExclusion:\u00a0Pregnancy, sensitivity to study drugs, G6PD deficiency, under 18 years old, vasospastic diathesis (e.g. Raynaud\u2019s), coronary disease, MAOI administration\n40 patients enrolled; none lost to follow-up\nBaseline characteristics (Methylene Blue group vs Vasopressin group)\n\nAge: 55 vs 59 years\nSOFA score: 10 vs 10\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nMethylene Blue\n\nBolus 1 mg/kg\nInfusion 2 hours later of 0.5 mg/kg/h for 4 hours\n\n\n\nControl\n\nVasopressin\n\nInfusion of 0.02 U/kg/h for 6 hours\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAdrenaline and Noradrenaline titrated to achieve MAP 60-80 mmHg\n\nAdjusted in steps of 0.02 \u00b5g/kg/min every 15 minutes if MAP > 80 mmHg\nNoradrenaline weaned before Adrenaline\n\n\nFluid resuscitation titrated to cardiac index and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure\nPiperacillin+Tazobactam was first line antibiotic\nLung protective invasive ventilation if PaO2< 6.6 kPa (50 mmHg)\nEnteric feeding\nDVT and ulcer prophylaxis\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\u00a0not specified\n\nMAP was higher in the Methylene Blue group (numbers appear wrongly reported in manuscript\u2019s results section but figure and discussion section are in agreement)\n\nAt 6 hours: 75 \u00b1 5.9\u00a0mmHg vs 68 \u00b1 6.8 mmHg\n\nMean difference 7.0 mmHg (95% CI\u00a02.9 to 11.1; P = 0.001)\n\n\nAt 24 hours: 74 \u00b1 6.9 mmHg vs 68 \u00b1 6.9\u00a0mmHg\n\nMean difference 6.0 mmHg (95% CI\u00a01.5 to 10.4; P = 0.009)\n\n\n\n\nDose of noradrenaline became significantly lower in the Methylene Blue group compared to the Vasopressin group at 6 hours\nDose of adrenaline became significantly lower in the Methylene Blue group compared to the Vasopressin group at 2 hours\nOxygen extraction ratio was significantly lower in the Methylene Blue group compared to the Vasopressin group at 6 hours\nNo significant difference in length of ICU stay\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn sepsis-induced refractory vasoplegia methylene blue may be more effective than vasopressin but further studies are required\n\nStrengths\n\nGiven the findings of VANISH, asking research questions like this is clinically important\nAppropriate to examine this clinical question by\u00a0a randomised, controlled trial design\nAppropriate statistical tests for the data types presented\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle centre (and published in that single centre\u2019s own medical journal)\nSelection bias likely given only 40 patients recruited over 4 years\nWithout adequate randomisation sequence concealment, the potential impact on selection bias is huge\n\nThat is, researchers may have selected certain patients for the trial knowing that they will enter one group or the other\n\n\nIf \u2018single blinded\u2019 means the patient didn\u2019t know but the clinician did, then allocation bias is possible (Cochrane Centre call this performance bias)\n\nThat is, clinicians may have given non standard care to favour one group over the other\n\n\nUnclear primary outcome\n\nAlthough they have stated a power calculation, it is meaningless if we are not told what is the primary outcome\n\n\nOutcomes are not patient-centred\nErrors in the manuscript\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAlthough an exciting and relevant clinical question, the methodological flaws in this study potentially introduce far too many biases for the conclusion to be accepted\nFurther patient-centred trials are required before I will be reaching for the methylene blue\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Methylene blue versus vasopressin in sepsis-induced vasoplegia\n[further reading]\u00a0Methylene Blue by LITFL\n[further reading]\u00a0Use of methylene blue in sepsis: a systematic review\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Duncan Chambler\nSummary date:\u00a08 February 2017\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0Adrian Wong\n\n\n"
