NEJM; June 3 2020. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2016638\nClinical Question\n\nIn people who have high-risk or moderate-risk exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19 infection, does taking hydroxychloroquine following the exposure compared to placebo reduce the incidence of a new illness compatible with COVID-19?\n\nBackground\n\nIn December 2019 the Wuhan province in China became the epicentre of a devastating, highly contagious viral infection, SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 illness\nBy March 2020, the World Health Organisation announced they were deeply concerned by the alarming levels of spread and severity of the disease and characterised COVID-19 as a pandemic\nHealth Care Workers (HCWs) are particularly vulnerable to infection due to occupational exposure to infected patients\nData is incomplete, but large numbers of HCWs have contracted the illness or died. In the UK, May 23, The Guardian reported 49 HCWs had died; in China, June 4, NEJM reported the death of 23 HCWs; in the USA, May 28, the CDC report 62690 HCW infections with COVID-19 and 294 deaths (although obituary data suggests 530 HCW COVID-19 deaths); in Italy, June 9, The Federation of Surgeons and Dentists, reported 167 Italian doctors have died of COVID-19\nThe prevention of infection in HCWs relies on personal protective equipment, quarantine of exposed workers, tracking and tracing close contacts\nHydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a medication traditionally used to manage rheumatoid arthritis and malaria has gained interest as a potential pharmacological agent to prevent the entry and endocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell, by impairing the terminal glycosylation of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor\nSome in vitro studies suggest that HCQ suppresses the activity of SARS-CoV-2\nIn patients with confirmed COVID-19, there have been several observational studies and small RCTs reporting benefit of HCQ therapy- however, these studies were low quality studies, with small sample sizes, often had non-critically ill patients, did not have clinically meaningful outcomes and had short or incomplete follow-up\nThe authors of the RECOVERY trial have interrupted randomising into the hydroxychloroquine arm as there was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of 28-day mortality in 3132 hospitalised COVID-19 patients\nThe prophylactic role of HCQ is explored in this study\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial\n1:1 assignment to either HCQ or placebo\nParticipants enrolled themselves through an online platform\nVariable sized permuted-blocks and stratification to country\nThe participants understanding of the trial design was assessed and if deemed adequate, consent was sought with an electronic signature indicating informed consent\nHCQ or placebo was shipped overnight to the participant by courier\nThe placebo tablet (folate tablets) had an appearance very similar to the HCQ tablet\nParticipants and investigators were unaware of the treatment allocation\nAn email survey was sent to assess outcomes on Day 1,5,10 and 14\nAnother survey was sent at 4-6 weeks to assess illness, hospitalisation and testing\nOriginally, an estimated 621 persons per group were needed assuming 10% infection of close contact and a 50% relative effect size to reduce new symptomatic infection, a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and 90% power\nDue to the internet-based, self-referral recruitment, it was planned that there would be a 20% attrition of participants, so this increased the persons needed to 750/group (total 1500)\nA protocol re-estimation of sample size was prespecified to allow for adjustment after the second interim analysis and the recalculation reduced the sample size to 956 (478/group)\n\nSetting\n\nParticipants were enrolled across the USA and 3 Canadian provinces (Quebec, Alberta, and Manitoba) from\u00a0March 17 to May 6th, 2020\nThe trial was halted after a third interim analysis deemed futility in continuing\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Participants self-selected and had a household or occupational exposure to a person with confirmed COVID-19 at a distance of <6 feet for >10 minutes whilst wearing neither a mask or goggles (high-risk exposure) or a mask and no goggles (moderate-risk exposure)\n\nParticipants were eligible to enrol within 3 days of exposure: initially due to poor access to prompt testing, enrolment was on the basis of exposure to patients with pending test results. However, after March 23, the exposure had to be to a patient with confirmed PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2\n\n\nExclusion:\n\n<18 years\nAlready taking hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine\nAlready taking cardiac medicines: flecainide; amiodarone; digoxin; procainamide; or sotalol\nAlready taking QT prolonging medicines\nhydroxychloroquine allergy\nRetinal eye disease\nG6PD deficiency\nCKD 4 or 5 or receiving dialysis\nPorphyria\nWeight <40kg\nReceiving chemotherapy\n\n\nIn Canada, additional exclusions:\n\nPregnant and/or breastfeeding\nSevere diarrhoea or vomiting\nKnown cirrhosis with encephalopathy or ascites\nKnown prolonged QT interval\nVentricular arrhythmia or history of sudden cardiac death\nQT prolonging medicines\n\n\n\n\n821 participants were recruited\n\n\u00a0245 had a household exposure, 545 were exposed as a HCW, 31 had other occupational exposure\n\n\nBaseline characteristics were similar between groups:\n\nMedian age was 40 years, 27.4% had chronic health conditions, 51.6% were women\nIn the case of HCWs, 77% had a patient exposure, 20% were exposed to an ill coworker\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nHydroxychloroquine\n\n414 Participants received HCQ via courier\n19 x 200mg tablets were delivered: they took 4 tablets on Day 1, then 3 tablets 8 hours later, then 3 tablets each day for 4 days\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\n407 Participants received the Placebo tablets via courier\n19 tablets: they took 4 immediately, then 3 tablets 8 hours later, then 3 each day for 4 days\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nStudy stopped at 3rd interim analysis, after 821 patients recruited, for futility\nPrimary outcome:\n\nSymptomatic illness confirmed by a positive assay test or if testing unavailable, COVID-19 symptoms based on the US Epidemiological criteria (the presence of cough, SOB, dyspnoea, or 2 of fever, chills, rigors, myalgia, headache, sore throat, new olfactory or taste disturbance)\nThere was no significant difference: HCQ 49/414 = 11.8%, Placebo 58/407 = 14.3% (95% CI -7 to 2.2; p=0.35)\n\n\nSecondary outcome: HCQ vs Placebo\n\nHospitalisation (0.2% vs 0.2%)\nDeath (0 vs 0%)\nPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (2.7% vs 2.2%; p =0.82)\nCOVID-19 symptoms (11.6% vs 13.5%; p=0.46)\n100% adherence to trial intervention (75.4% vs 82.6%; p=0.01)\nSide effects of intervention (40.1% vs 16.8%; p<0.001) -most commonly nausea and GI symptoms\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThis randomised trial did not demonstrate a significant benefit of hydroxychloroquine as post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19\n\nStrengths\n\nAllocation concealment\nBlinding of outcome assessors\nClinically meaningful outcomes\nThe participants were from geographically broad areas improving external validity\nThe trial was implemented in a timely fashion keeping investigators safe and providing information about a potential prophylactic intervention in the middle of a devastating pandemic\nThe group tested were relatively young, however, it is likely that the results can be extrapolated to a broader population as the infection rate is similar in young and old, although older people get more severe disease\n\nWeaknesses\n\nTrial stopped early thus is technically underpowered for primary outcome\nNumbers lost in each group at Day 14: 46 in HCQ vs 42 in placebo group\n\nA sensitivity analysis did not suggest that these lost to follow-up would alter the overall result (and was factored in to the original sample size calculation)\n\n\nThe trial does not exclude a benefit from pre-exposure prophylaxis\n57% of participants did not take the intervention until 3-4 days after exposure, which may be too late\nPCR testing was not available in all participants with the presumptive diagnosis based on symptoms likely less sensitive\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIf I had a high-risk exposure to a patient with COVID-19 I would not take hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis based on this trial\nAs well as showing no benefit there is a high incidence of adverse side effects with hydroxychloroquine and it is poorly tolerated\n\nExternal Links\n\nA Randomized Trial of Hydroxychloroquine as Postexposure Prophylaxis for COVID-19\nHydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, is effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford\nSummary date: 10th June 2020\nPeer-review editor: Segun Olusanya\n\n\n"
