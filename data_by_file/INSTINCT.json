It inhibits the activity of streptococcal and staphylococcal virulence factors\nNSTI\u2019s are characterised clinically by fulminant tissue destruction, systemic signs of toxicity, and high mortality\n\nType 1: Polymicrobial: Anaerobic e.g. clostridium, non GAS, E Coli, klebsiella etc.\nType 2: Monomicrobial (GAS most common), staphylococcus, MRSA\n\n\nPrior to INSTINCT, The effects of IVIG vs placebo have been assessed in only one small RCT. This was stopped early because of slow recruitment rate (21 patients). The evidence base for IVIG therefore comes mainly from retrospective studies\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised blinded placebo controlled\nAll patients with confirmed NSTI (diagnosed in theatre by the surgeon) were screened\n1:1 randomisation\nStratified according to the presence or absence of NSTI on either head/neck/extremities to obtain a subgroup with a presumed higher rate of streptococcal or staphylococcal infections\nVariable block sizes of 2,4 and 6 were computer generated\nOpaque and sealed envelopes were used\nBlinded administration and analysis\nPhysical component summary (PCS) score \u00a0of SF-36 at 180 days after randomisation (0-100)\n\nPCS is composed of four scales assessing physical function, role limitations caused by physical\u2009problems, bodily pain, and general health. Higher scores represent better physical health\n\n\n100 patients needed to show a 7 point increase (15% relative increase) in PCS score at day 180 on the basis of a mean PCS score of 42 in the control group, an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80%\n\nSetting\n\nSingle specialist centre for management of NSTI in Denmark\nApril 2014 \u2013 March 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adult patients with confirmed NSTI at surgery and who were admitted to, or planned to be admitted to the ICU\nExclusion:\n\nPatients who had received more than one dose of IVIG before randomisation\n> 48 hours of NSTI\nPregnant or Breast feeding\nHypersensitivity to IVIG\n\n\n129 patients were screened, 100 were enrolled\nBaseline characteristics were similar although there were some differences in the following:\n\nHigher in the IVIG group\n\nAcute kidney injury: 10% vs 1%\nPresence of monomicrobial infection with Group A streptococcus: 56% vs 31%\n\n\nLower in the IVIG group\n\nMedian time from admission to primary operation was lower in the IVIG group: 18 vs 25 hours\nIVIG received before randomisation was lower in the IVIG group: 16% vs 40%\nPresence of monomicrobial infection with S.Aureus: 0% vs 23%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nIVIG 25g/day for three consecutive days\n\nControl\n\n0.9% sodium chloride \u2013 equivalent volume for three consecutive days\n\nIn both groups\n\nAll other interventions given at discretion of treating physician as per the unit protocol. This included: repeated surgical revisions, intravenous antimicrobials (clindamycin, meropenem and ciprofloxacin) and three sessions of hyperbaric oxygen; sepsis and supportive intensive care\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Mean physical component summary (PCS) score at day 180 after randomisation was higher, but not statistically significant, in the IVIG group\n\n36 (IQR 0-43) vs 31 (IQR 0-47); 95% CI -7 to 10, P=0.81\nNo statistical difference between groups in the analyses when adjusted for age and SOFA scores at baseline\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: No statistical difference in any outcomes. These included:\n\nMortality at 28, 90 and 180 days\nTime to resolution of shock\nSevere bleeding (3 units of PRBC\u2019s within 24 hours of the episode in ICU after randomisation)\nAny bleeding in the ICU after randomisation\nTotal volume of blood products used in the ICU after randomisation\nSOFA scores at days 1-7 (excluding the GCS component)\nUse of RRT, ventilation and vasopressor in the ICU\nSerious adverse events\nDays alive off life support in the 90 days after randomisation\nDays alive and out of hospital in the 180-day follow-up period\nAny amputation within the 180 days\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn ICU patients with NSTI, there was no apparent effects of adjuvant IVIG on self-reported physical functioning at 6 months\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised\nBlinded\nPatient reported outcomes\nEarly intervention (in theatre/ICU on confirmed diagnosis)\nProtocolised management\nRegistered with ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT02111161), before the inclusion of the first patient, and the trial protocol, including the statistical analysis plan, has been published\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle prior dose of IVIG allowed\nA lower dose of IVIG was administered compared with most UK practice. This limits the external validity\nThe proportion of patients infected with either group A streptococcus or S.Aureus was unevenly distributed between the two groups\nManagement of NTSI is centralised in Denmark. Details around initial supportive management and transfer are not supplied and differences would effect both internal and external validity. Most referring hospitals did however perform the initial surgery\nHyperbaric oxygen is not typical practice in UK which affects the external validity\nAntimicrobial use was based on unit policy but is not typical for UK practice. This again might limit the studies external validity\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study does not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in patient centred outcomes when IVIG is used in combination with surgery, antimicrobials and hyperbaric oxygen, although the wide 95% CI do not exclude a clinically meaningful harm or benefit\nDespite a number of weaknesses, this trial provides valuable data to inform future studies on NSTI\u2019s\nFurther studies should concentrate on identifying and treating subgroups of NSTI\u2019s, particularly with streptococcal and staphylococcal infections\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Immunoglobulin G for patients with necrotising soft tissue infection: a randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trial\n[Editorial]\u00a0Therapeutic targets in\u00a0necrotizing soft tissue infections\n[further reading] Darenberg.
