Intensive Care Medicine 2016; First online September 30th, 2016. doi:10.1007/s00134-016-4465-6\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients who are anaemic, does early administration of intravenous iron compared to placebo reduce the requirement for blood transfusion?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, placebo-controlled trial\nDouble-blinded design with opaque sleeve covering study drug\n\nAdequacy of blinding assessed with sub-study\n\n\nOnline software produced 1:1 randomisation sequence stratified by study centre\nSealed, opaque, numbered envelopes maintained allocation concealment\nPower calculation was based upon observational data suggesting a mean of 4 red blood cell (RBC) units transfused with\u00a0a standard deviation (SD) or 2 units\n\n140 patients allowed a detection of a clinically meaningful 1 unit difference with a false negative chance\u00a0of 20% (80% Power) and a false positive chance of 5% (alpha significiance 0.05)\n\n\nThe primary outcome was not normally distributed and therefore the analysis was changed from parametric testing (as published a priori) to non-parametric testing with reporting of median rather than mean units transfused\n\nSetting\n\n4 Intensive Care Units in Perth, Western Australia\nJune 2013 to June 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\u00a0age 18 or older; within 48 hours of ICU admision; anticipated to require ICU care beyond next day; anaemic with Hb < 100 g/l within preceeding 24 hours\nExclusion:\u00a0suspected or confirmed severe sepsis; ferritin > 1,200 ng/ml; transferrin saturation greater than 50%\n140 patients randomised\n\nIntervention\n\nIntravenous (IV) Iron\n\n500 mg ferric carboxymaltose\nMade in 100 ml 0.9% NaCl\nGiven as two consecutive 50 ml syringes\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\n100 ml 0.9% NaCl\nGiven as two consecutive 50 ml syringes\n\n\n\nCommon management of both groups\n\nOn day 4, patients still in ICU were assessed for a repeat dose of iron or placebo as per randomisation group\n\nThis was given if they fulfilled the inclusion / exclusion criteria\nRepeat dosing assessment was made daily until four doses had been give, the patient died, or the patient was discharged from ICU\n\n\nPatient management was otherwise at the blinded treating physicians\u2019 discretion\n\nThis included the administration of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (primary outcome)\n\n\nOpen-label \u00a0IV iron or erythropoiesis-stimulating drugs were considered protocol violations\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: there was no significant difference in the median number of RBC units transfused between the IV iron group and the placebo group (from randomisation until hospital discharge)\n\nIV iron group: median RBC units was 1 [IQR 0-2]\nPlacebo group: median RBC units was 1 [IQR 0-3]\nP-value = 0.53\nIncident rate ratio (IRR): 0.71 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.18; p-value 0.19)\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nMedian Hb was significantly higher in the IV iron group at discharge from hospital: 107 g/l vs 100 g/l (p = 0.02)\nMedian lengths of stay were not significantly different\nMortality rates were not significantly different\nAdverse event rates were not significantly different\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn anaemic patients who are admitted to ICU, IV iron did not result in a reduction in red blood cell transfusion compared to placebo, however they did leave hospital with a higher haemoglobin level.\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre randomised trial\nRobust blinding of patient and treating clinicians\nAdequate randomisation and concealment of allocation\nMinimal cross-over\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDespite attempting to represent all ICU patients, a large proportion were cardiothoracic surgical (35%) or trauma (32%) patients\n\nMedical patients only made up 14%\nThis reduces the generalisability of the study to other units and populations\n\n\nThe mean units transfused was 1.9, which is much less than the expected 4.0\n\nThis reduces the effective power of the study\nIt is possible that a false negative conclusion (type 2 error) has been drawn\n\n\nThe distribution of the primary outcome was not as anticipated, leading to a post-hoc change in the analysis\n\nWhilst the statistical methods are appropriate, this potentially reduces the strength\u00a0of the internal validity\u00a0and the study\u2019s conclusion\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study is inconclusive due to the impact of the unanticipated low rate of transfusion\nThe point estimate favours IV iron, but the confidence intervals are wide\nFurther studies are needed before the widespread use of IV iron can be rejected or\u00a0implemented\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Intravenous iron or placebo for anaemia in intensive care: the IRONMAN multicentre randomized blinded trial\n[further reading]\u00a0Anaemia by LITFL\n[further reading]\u00a0Managing Anaemia in Critical Care by Prof Walsh\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Duncan Chambler\nSummary date:\u00a08 December 2016\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0Celia Bradford\n\n\n"
