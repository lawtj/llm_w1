NEJM. 2014;370:1583-1593\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with septic shock does a high target mean arterial pressure (MAP), compared to a low target MAP, improve mortality?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nStratified according to presence of chronic hypertension\nOpen label\nBlinding of patients and research staff\n\nSetting\n\n29 centres in France\nMarch 2010 \u2013 December 2011\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: adult patients with septic shock that was refractory to fluid resuscitation, and had been treated with >0.1mcg/kg adrenaline or noradrenaline for <6 hours at inclusion\n\nRefractory to fluid resuscitation defined as lack of response to 30ml/kg of normal saline/colloids or clinician assessment based on invasive measures or echocardiography\n\n\nExclusion: Pregnancy, decision not to resuscitate\n776 patients enrolled\n\nIntervention\n\ntarget MAP 80-85\n\nfor maximum of 5 days or until weaned from vasopressor support\nobserved values were generally MAP 85-90\n\n\n\nControl\n\ntarget MAP 65-70\n\nobserved values generally 70-75\n\n\n\nIn both intervention and control group, fluid resuscitation performed as recommended by French intensive care societies; with noradrenaline administered as a 1st line vasopressor in 28 centres, and adrenaline in 1 centre. The use of hydrocortisone and activated protein C was at the discretion of the treating physician. Diuretics prohibited except for \u2018compelling indications,\u2019 such as hypoxaemia secondary to sodium and water overload, or life-threatening hyperkalaemia.\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: mortality at 28 days \u2013 no significant difference\n\n36.6% in high MAP group vs. 34% in low MAP group (hazard ratio 1.07, 95% C.I. 0.84-1.38, P=0.57)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nserious adverse events \u2013 no significant difference\n\n19.1% vs. 17.8%, P=0.64\n\n\nnew atrial fibrillation \u2013 significantly greater in high MAP group\n\n6.7% vs. 2.8%, P=0.02\n\n\n90 day mortality \u2013 no significant difference\n\n43.7% vs. 42.3%\n\n\n\n\nSub-group analysis\u00a0in patients with chronic hypertension (n=340)\n\ndoubling of serum creatinine \u2013 significantly lower in the high MAP group\n\n38.9% vs 52%, P=0.02, NNT 7.6\n\n\nnumber that required renal replacement therapy from day 1-7 \u2013 significantly lower in the high MAP group\n\n31.7% vs. 42.2%, P=0.046, NNT 9.5\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nTargeting a MAP of 80-85, compared with 65-70 did not affect mortality\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised\nBlinding of research staff\nStandard protocol for use of renal replacement therapy\nNo significant difference in fluid intake between intervention and control group\nClearly defined thresholds for renal replacement therapy\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDue to a lower mortality than predicted the study was under powered\nFrequent use of steroids and activated protein C may limit generalisability\nAchieved MAP was higher than target MAP, although this is common practice in many ICUs\nLess than 15 patients recruited per centre per year. For a common condition this is surprisingly low and may limit the external validity of the trial.\nThe authors report 16.5% of patients in the high MAP group vs. 10.3% (P=0.01) in the low MAP group failed to achieve target BP because the attending clinician decided to limit the vasopressor infusion. Whilst this is an ethically important safety factor, this compliance bias will favour the null hypothesis.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFor the majority of patients in septic shock a target MAP of 65-70 is a good starting point. However, in patients with chronic hypertension I will target a higher MAP. This is because, even though this did not improve mortality, it did reduce the need for renal replacement therapy with a NNT of 9.5. A number of studies have previously demonstrated that the need for renal replacement therapy is associated with mortality.\nIn patients without hypertension further studies comparing a MAP of 65 with a lower MAP of e.g. 55 would be beneficial\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text only available with subscription /\u00a0abstract / doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1312173\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\nResus.me\nMedical Evidence Blog\nFurther reading\u00a0Higher versus lower blood pressure targets for vasopressor therapy in shock: a multicentre pilot randomized controlled trial \u2013 in patients >75 years a lower MAP resulted in a reduced mortality\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@DavidSlessor\nSummary date: 16 June 2014\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n\n"
