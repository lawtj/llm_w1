Intensive Care Medicine February 2019; DOI: 10.1007/s00134-019-05567-4\nClinical Question\n\nCan extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) safely facilitate ultra-low tidal volume ventilation in patients with moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)?\n\nBackground\n\nFor patients with ARDS, use of a ventilation strategy which prioritizes low tidal volumes (4-6 mL/kg predicted body weight) and low inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cmH2O) is strongly supported by consensus guidelines\u00a0\nIt is unclear whether ultra-low tidal volume ventilation (3-4 mL/kg PBW) provides additional protection beyond that achieved with traditional lung-protective ventilation. Additionally, attempts to significantly lower tidal volumes are often limited by severe respiratory acidosis\nExtracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) has been proposed as a way to facilitate ultra-low tidal volume ventilation although the safety and feasibility of this approach has not been well studied\n\nDesign\n\nMulticenter prospective phase 2 single-arm study\nBlinding not performed given the nature of the intervention and the study design\nPower calculation:\n\nBased on the assumption that PaCO2 would be 40\u201360 mmHg with tidal volumes of 6 mL/kg Predicted Body Weight (PBW) and that PaCO2 would increase to 65\u201385 mmHg when tidal volumes were lowered to 4 mL/kg PBW.\nInvestigators estimated that a sample size of 90 patients would be required to establish the ability of ECCO2R to return PaCO2 levels to within 20% of baseline. This sample size would provide a two-sided 95% confidence interval of 70\u201390% if the incidence of meeting this condition was 80% and 54\u201375% if the incidence was 65%\nThe goal enrollment was increased to 100 patients to account for an expected 3% dropout rate\nData analysis was performed by a researcher who was not involved in data collection or a member of the study steering committee\nSevere adverse events (SAEs) were reported to the clinical coordinator. Determination of whether SAEs were directly attributable to ECCO2R was performed by an independent safety monitoring board\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n23 hospitals across Europe and Canada\nOctober 2015 to June 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n18 years of age or older\nModerate ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 100\u2013200 mmHg on at least a PEEP of 5 cmH2O)\nAnticipated duration of mechanical ventilation >24 hours\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nDecompensated heart failure\nAcute coronary syndrome\nSevere chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nMajor respiratory acidosis with PaCO2 >60mmHg\nAcute brain injury\nSevere liver insufficiency (Child-Pugh >7)\nFulminant hepatic failure\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia\nContraindication to systemic anticoagulation\nPlatelet < 50 G/L\nMoribund\nDecision to limit therapeutic interventions\nInability to access femoral or jugular vein\nPneumothorax\n\n\n755 patients met entry criteria, 95 patients enrolled (each center enrolled a median of 3 patients)\nNo patients lost to follow-up\nBaseline characteristics (mean +/- standard deviation or median [interquartile range])\n\nAge (years): 60.2 +/- 14.0\nFemale: 31 (32.6%)\nPneumonia as the cause of ARDS: 78 (82.1%)\nTidal volume (mL/kg PBW): 6.0 +/- 0.2\nPEEP (cmH2O): 15.5 [10.0;16.0]\nPplt (cmH2O): 26.6 +/- 3.0\nDriving pressure (cmH2O): 13.2 +/- 4.3\nPaCO2 (mmHg): 47.8 +/- 9.4\npH: 7.34 +/- 0.08\nPaO2/FiO2 (mmHg): 173 +/- 61\nNeuromuscular blockade: 80 (84.2%)\nProne positioning: 23 (24.2%)\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nThree different ECCO2R systems were used. Each trial site used only 1 device type during the study:\n\nHemolung Respiratory Assist System (ALung Technologies): Membrane lung with cross-sectional area of 0.59 m2, blood flow between 300\u2013500 mL/min. 15.5 Fr catheter\niLA active (Novalung): Membrane lung with cross-sectional area of 1.30 m2 with blood flow 800\u20131000 mL/min (upper limit set by the trial protocol, not the capability of the machine). 18\u201320 Fr catheter\nCardiohelp HLS 5.0 (Getinge Cardiopulmonary Care): Membrane lung with cross-sectional area of 1.30 m2 with blood flow 800\u20131000 mL/min (upper limit set by the trial protocol, not the capability of the machine). 18\u201320 Fr catheter\n\n\nProtocol:\n\nSedation and neuromuscular blockade administered for a minimum of 24 hours following enrollment\nTidal volume initially set at 6 mL/kg PBW and PEEP adjusted to maintain a Pplt between 28\u201330 cmH2O\nECCO2R catheter inserted in either the internal jugular or femoral vein\nUnfractionated heparin given to achieve an activated partial thromboplastin time of 35\u201380 seconds\nTidal volume reduced step-wise to 4 mL/kg PBW and PEEP titrated to Pplt 23-25 cmH2O\nSweep gas and blood flow set to maintain a PaCO2 between 80\u2013120% of the baseline value\nTidal volume increased if PaCO2 exceeded 75 mmHg and/or pH fell below 7.30 despite a respiratory rate of 35 breaths/minute\nData collected at baseline, 8 hours, and 24 hours. After 24 hours the attending physician was allowed to determine ventilator settings and need for continued ECCO2R\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Number of patients who successfully achieved a tidal volume of 4 mL/kg PBW with a PaCO2 not increasing more than 20% from baseline with an arterial pH > 7.30\n\n8 hours: 78% (95% CI: 68\u201389%)\n24 hours: 82% (95% CI: 76\u201388%)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nDuration of ECCO2R (days): 5 [3\u20138]\nDuration of invasive mechanical ventilation (days): 17 [11\u201329]\nAlive at day 28: 69 (73%)\nPhysiologic variables\n\nTidal volume at 24 hours (mL/kg PBW): 4.16 +/- 0.46\nPplt at 24 hours (cmH2O): 23.5 +/- 3.9\nPEEP at 24 hours (cmH2O): 13.8 +/- 3.9\nDriving pressure at 24 hours (cmH2O): 9.9 +/- 4.3\n\n\nAdverse events\n\nSevere adverse events\n\n6 total (massive right frontal parenchymal hematoma, severe hematemesis and melena, SVC thrombosis, sudden death, severe hypoxemia, pneumothorax during cannulation)\nThe brain bleed and pneumothorax were attributed directly to ECCO2R\n\n\nAdverse events\n\n39% of patients experienced an AE\n26 patients (27%) experienced an AE in the first 24 hours\nMembrane lung clotting: 13 (14%)\nPump malfunction: 3 (3%)\nCatheter displacement: 2 (2%)\nHemolysis: 11 (12%)\nSignificant bleeding: 6 (6%)\nInfectious complications: 2 (2%)\nThrombocytopenia: 12 (13%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nECCO2R can facilitate ultra-low tidal volume ventilation. A randomized trial is required to inform use of this intervention in patients with ARDS\n\nStrengths\n\nThe largest safety and feasibility study of ECCO2R \u2013 a novel and potentially beneficial extracorporeal therapy for patients with ARDS\nInternational cohort of study centers increasing generalizability of the results\nNo patients lost to follow-up during the study period\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThree different ECCO2R systems were used. It is not possible to tell from the data provided if efficacy or safety differed between the devices\nCO2 clearance not quantified despite this being listed as a study endpoint on clinicaltrials.gov\nStudy halted short of enrollment goal due to lack of equipment\nNot clearly powered for safety outcomes\nThe primary outcome of achieving an ultra-low tidal volume without severe hypercapnia, while appropriate for a feasibility and safety study, is not patient-centered and is of unclear clinical significance\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nECCO2R can facilitate ultra-low tidal volume ventilation in patients with moderate ARDS\nWhether ultra-low tidal volume ventilation improves outcomes for patients with ARDS remains unclear\nIn my opinion, the high number of adverse events (including 6 SAEs) observed in this study and the still unclear benefit of ultra-low tidal volume ventilation argues against use of ECCO2R in ARDS outside of a clinical trial\nThe study highlights just how hard it is to enroll patients in these types of trials, even at high volume centers experienced in studies of extracorporeal support\nThis study is a useful prelude to the ongoing REST trial \u2013 a randomized trial of ECCO2R vs standard care in patients with ARDS\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Article] Feasibility and Safety of Extracorporeal CO2 Removal to Enhance Protective Ventilation in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: The SUPERNOVA Study\n[further reading] An Official American Thoracic Society/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine/Society of Critical Care Medicine Clinical Practice Guideline: Mechanical Ventilation in Adult Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n[further reading] Ultra-protective tidal volume: how low should we go?\n[further reading] pRotective vEntilation With Veno-venouS Lung assisT in Respiratory Failure (REST)\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0James M.
