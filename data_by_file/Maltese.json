Intensive Care Medicine (2016) 42:393-400 DOI 10.1007/s00134-4115-4\nClinical Question\n\nIn Intensive care doctors what is the impact of night shift work on cognitive performance?\n\nDesign\n\nProspective, observational, comparative, randomised, cross-over study\nFour cognitive skills were tested on ICU doctors following night shift (NS) and following a night of rest (NR) at home\nRandomisation was used to determine the order of evaluation of the two conditions (NS or NR first) to minimise a possible training bias of doing the tests twice and the content of the tests were changed between the first and second evaluation\n\nSetting\n\n3 different intensive care units in one hospital (North Hospital), Marseille, France\nOctober 2012 \u2013 October 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Intensive Care Doctors (staff physicians or residents)\nExclusion: Unwilling to participate, or incomplete participation due to shift allocation\n58 doctors contacted; 51 participated (27 residents, 21 physicians), 4 refused, 3 incomplete participation\n\nIntervention\n\nEvaluation was conducted by the same psychologist in a quiet office between 10am-noon\nAssessment commenced with a demographic and lifestyle questionnaire with self-assessment of attentional capacity or tiredness using visual analogue scales\n4 cognitive tasks were then completed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test to assess verbal comprehension, working memory, processing speed and perceptual reasoning\nEach doctor had 2 evaluations separated by a period of at least 7 days. The NR condition took place at least 3 days after the last on-duty shift. The NS evaluation occurred following a 14 hour night shift which followed a 10 hour working day (participants could have a nap during the day preceding night shift).\nThe influence of professional experience and the amount of sleep on cognitive performance was also investigated\n\nControl\n\nThe participants were their own control and the comparison was made between cognitive performance after night shift and cognitive performance after a night of rest at home\n\nOutcome\n\nAll cognitive abilities declined after night shift\n\nWorking memory capacity(WMC)\n\n9.5% lower after night shift (p<0.001)\nAlthough the working memory capacity was higher in the physicians than the residents after a night of rest, there was no difference after a night shift\nThe number of hours slept on the night shift (<2, 2-4 or >4 hours) did not impact WMC\n\n\nInformation processing speed (IPS)\n\n12.5% lower after night shift (p<0.001)\nIPS was similar in physicians and residents after NR and NS\nThe number of hours slept on the night shift did not impact IPS\n\n\nPerceptual reasoning (PR)\n\n6.5% lower after night shift (p<0.002)\nPR was significantly lower in residents compared with physicians after NS\nThe number of hours slept on night shift did not impact PR\n\n\nCognitive flexibility (CF)\n\nnot statistically significantly lower after night shift (p=0.063)\nCF was significantly less in residents after NSCF was significantly less in physicians if sleep time was <2hrs on night shift\n\n\n\n\nA correlation analysis was performed between the self-reported tiredness or attentional abilities by physicians and their actual performance. There was no significant correlation between the self-report and the cognitive evaluation\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAll cognitive abilities worsened after night shift. The level of impairment did not differ based on seniority of the doctor or the hours of sleep obtained on the night shift. Doctors were found to be poor at self-evaluating their level of fatigue\n\nStrengths\n\nProspective, observational trial of an important issue of workplace safety\nThe tools used for the assessment were a validated technique for measuring cognitive function\nHaving the participant as their own control was an effective way of detecting any change following night shift\nRandomisation of participants to do the first testing either after NS or after NR minimised the impact of \u2018learning how to do the test\u2019 on the results\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe study did not aim to correlate decline in cognition and its relationship to quality of patient care and the chance of error\nThe cognitive tests represented a moment in time, and may not accurately reflect the real world where chronic sleep deprivation may impact on functional capacity. Protracted periods of time on night shift may alter the cognitive performance further\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nNight shift reduces the cognitive ability of physicians. Awareness of this may be a trigger to improve patient safety such that delaying non-urgent procedures or decisions until daylight hours is prioritised\n\nExternal Links\n\nOriginal article abstract;\u00a0Night shift decreases cognitive performance of ICU physicians.
