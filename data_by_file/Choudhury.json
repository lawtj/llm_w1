Liver International 2016, published on-line doi:10.1111/liv.13252\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with cirrhosis and septic shock does terlipressin in comparison with noradrenaline improve haemodynamic parameters?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n\nRandomised in 1:1 ratio\nBlock randomisation with fixed block size of 6\nSequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes \u2013 not documented if any checks were completed to ensure allocation concealment was maintained\n\n\nNon-blinded\nConsecutive recruitment\nNon-inferiority trial\nSample size calculation: 82 patients required to determine a non-inferiority limit of 15% from a baseline of 40% haemodynamic improvement in the noradrenaline group, with a two sided alpha of 0.05 and a power of 90%\nIntention to treat analysis used for primary outcome\nA per-protocol analysis was also performed\n\nSetting\n\nSingle liver intensive care unit, India\nData collected March 2013 \u2013 September 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria: Decompensated cirrhosis with septic shock, that did not respond to fluids\n\nDecompensated cirrhosis \u2013 not defined\nSeptic shock\n\n2+ SIRS criteria\nProven/suspected infection\nVasopressor required to maintain MAP \u226565mmHg despite 2 hours of fluid resuscitation\n\n15ml/kg normal saline over 30min followed by 5% albumin at 50ml/hr for 6 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusion criteria: age <18 years, valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, acute mesenteric ischaemia, peripheral vascular disease, pregnancy, chronic kidney disease, uncontrolled or refractory variceal bleed, immunosuppressive drugs\n511 patients screened of whom 84 randomised\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nAge: 47 vs. 48\nAlcoholic liver disease: 64% vs. 52%\nSource of sepsis \u2013 significant difference\n\nSpontaneous bacterial peritonitis: 50% vs. 26.2%, p=0.04\nPneumonia: 21.4% vs. 47.6%, p=0.02\n\n\nMELD score: 32 vs. 32\nLactate: 3 vs. 3\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nTerlipressin\n\nTitrated and infused at a rate of 1.3-5.2ug/min (2-8mg over 24)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNoradrenaline\n\nTitrated and infused at a rate of 7.5-60ug/min\n\n\n\nFor all patients\n\nStandard medical therapy included IV fluids and antibiotics\n20% albumin given at 1.5gm/kg on 1st day followed by 1mg/kg for next 2 days, except those anuric or on renal replacement therapy\nTarget MAP \u226565mmHg\nIf unable achieve MAP at highest dose of study drug, salvage therapy initiated\n\nCombination of noradrenaline at 7.5-30\u03bcg/min and terlipressin at 1.3\u03bcg-2.6ug/min.\nHydrocortisone 50mg every 6 hours\n\n\nAdrenaline or phenylephrine used as per clinical need\nSlow low-efficient dialysis was done in cases with acidosis, worsening azotemia or anuria. Continuous renal replacement therapy not available during study period\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nAchieve and maintain MAP >65\u00a0for initial 48 hours \u2013 significantly greater in terlipressin group\n\n92.9% vs. 69.1%, p=0.005\nNumber needed to treat: 5\nFragility index: 5\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes \u2013 comparing terlipressin vs. noradrenaline groups\n\nSurvival\n\n48 hours \u2013 significantly higher\u00a0in terlipressin group\n\n95.2% vs. 71.4%, p=0.003\n\n\n28 days \u2013 no significant difference\n\n26.2% vs. 14.3%, p=0.17\n\n\n\n\nTarget MAP achieved at 6 hours \u2013 no significant difference\n\n90.5% vs. 78.6%, p=0.003\n\n\nShock reversal at 48 hours (able to stop vasopressors) \u2013 significantly higher in terlipressin group\n\n33.1% vs. 11.9%, p<0.02\n\n\nNeed for salvage therapy \u2013 significantly higher in terlipressin group\n\n54.7% vs. 33.3%, p=0.03\n\n\nAdverse events\n\nOverall \u2013 \u00a0no significant difference\n\n40.5% vs. 21.4%, p=0.06\n\n\nPeripheral cyanosis \u2013 significantly higher in terlipressin group\n\n29% vs. 0%, p=0.05\n\n\n\n\nAssessment of microcirculation during first 48 hours \u2013 trend towards improvement with terlipressin\n\nCentral venous oxygen saturation, p=0.07\nVBG-ABG pCO2 difference, p=0.07\nLactate clearance, p=0.08\n\n\nLength of ICU stay \u2013 no significant difference\n\n6 vs. 5 days, p=0.99\n\n\nNew onset variceal bleeding \u2013 significantly lower in\u00a0terlipressin group\n\n0% vs. 9.5%, p=0.01\n\n\nPer-protocol analysis (patients who could be maintained on monotherapy till the outcome)\n\nSuccess of therapy at 48 hours \u2013 no significant difference\n\n100% vs. 82%, p=0.07\n\n\n48 hour survival \u2013 no significant difference\n\n100% vs. 89%, p=0.26\n\n\n28 day survival \u2013 significantly higher in terlipressin group\n\n47% vs. 11%, p=0.002\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nTerlipressin is as effective as noradrenaline as a vasopressor in patients with cirrhosis and septic shock and has an early survival benefit\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nIntention to treat and per-protocol analysis performed\nStudy protocol published on clinicaltrials.gov\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle centre\nNon-blinded\nNumber of baseline differences\nLarge number of patients excluded limiting external validity\nPrimary outcome was not a patient orientated outcome\nDose of albumin recorded in gm/kg on day 1 and mg/kg on day 2. This is likely to be a typographical error\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with cirrhosis and septic shock, this single centre non-blinded RCT demonstrated that terlipressin in comparison with noradrenaline improved haemodynamics and had a mortality benefit. Due to a number of methodological flaws and baseline differences I would want further evidence before this becomes standard practice.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0A randomized trial comparing terlipressin and noradrenaline in patients with cirrhosis and septic shock\n[further reading]\u00a0Noradrenaline vs. terlipressin in the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome: A randomized study\n[further reading]\u00a0Terlipressin versus noradrenaline in the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome: systematic review with meta-analysis and full economic evaluation\n[further reading]\u00a0Vasopressin versus Norepinephrine Infusion in Patients with Septic Shock\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date:\u00a05th March 2017\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@avkwong\n\n\n"
