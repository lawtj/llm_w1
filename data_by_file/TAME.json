DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2214552\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) does targeted mild hypercapnia compared to targeted normocapnia improve 6-month neurological outcomes?\n\nBackground\n\nIschaemia-reperfusion injury following cardiac arrest can further exacerbate the initial ischaemic insult and lead to worsening organ function\nSustained cerebral vasoconstriction and hypoxia has been demonstrated in this cohort of patients\nIt is hypothesised that mild targeted hypercapnia and the resultant vasodilatation may ameliorate some of these changes and thus improve outcomes\nSmall trials assessing mild hypercapnia have shown improved cerebral oxygenation and decreased neuron specific enolase levels and an observational cohort study of patients after OHCA showed an association of mild hypercapnia with improved outcomes\nThere is, however, no high-quality randomised evidence to guide CO2 targets\n\nDesign\n\nInternational, multi-centre, investigator-initiated, open label RCT\nCo-enrolment with other trials (e.g. TTM2) allowed\nRandomized as soon as possible following hospital admission by clinician using web-based software in a 1:1 ratio\n\nRandom permuted block sizes used and stratified by site and co-enrolment in TTM2\n\n\nUnblinded for bedside clinicians but outcome assessors unaware of allocation\nData for primary outcome collected in person, via telephone or videoconference interviews\nOutcome assessors provided with standardized training materials and pre-specified and ad-hoc checks carried out by study personnel\nPre-publication of protocol and statistical analysis plan\nSample Size Calculation\n\n1624 patients needed to provide 90% power to detect or reject an 8 percentage-point difference in favourable neurological outcome (50% in normocapnia and 58% in mild hypercapnia) at an alpha of 0.05\nBased on earlier trials of hypercapnia in cardiac arrest\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nMarch 2018 \u2013 September 2021\n63 ICUs in 17 countries\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAge \u2265 18\nOHCA of presumed cardiac or unknown cause\n< 180 minutes since ROSC\nSustained ROSC (> 20 minutes without chest compressions)\nUnconsciousness and unable to obey verbal commands\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nUnwitnessed OHCA\nAsystole as initial rhythm\nTemperature < 30\u00b0C\nECMO\nPregnancy\nIntracranial bleeding (suspected or confirmed)\nSevere COPD with long term home O2\n\n\n1700 randomised\n\n847 to mild hypercapnia and 853 to normocapnia\n5779 assessed for eligibility, 3732 excluded and 347 eligible but not randomised\n\n\nBalanced baseline characteristics\n\nComparing mild hypercapnia vs normocapnia group\nAge: 61 vs 62\nMale: 77 vs 81%\nWitnessed cardiac arrest: 88 vs 89%\nBystander CPR: 81 vs 81%\nFirst Rhythm shockable: 70 vs 73%\nMedian time from arrest to sustained ROSC: 26 vs 25 mins\nMedian time from arrest to randomisation: 154 vs 151 mins\nMedian arterial pH: 7.20 vs 7.22\nArterial lactate level: 6.79 vs 7.00 mmol/L\nFirst measured PaCO2: 52.8 vs 52.5 mmHg\nSTEMI: 41 vs 42%\nPCI: 35 vs 36%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nTargeted Therapeutic Mild Hypercapnia\n\n24 hours targeting PaCO2 50 \u2013 55 mmHg\nNormocapnia restored over following 24-48 hours\nAny severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.1 or BE > -6 mmol/L treated prior to commencement of hypercapnia)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNormocapnia\n\n24 hours targeting PaCO2 35 \u2013 45 mmHg\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nClear protocol if above or below target CO2\n\n4 hourly ABG if in range, or 30 minutes post ventilator change\nChanges in ETCO2 also used to guide ABG measurement (if changes > 5 mmHg then ABG required)\n\n\nDeep sedation targeted in both groups (-4 on RASS)\nAll other management at discretion of treating teams but should be guided by best local practice and ILCOR guidelines\nBlinded prognosticator performs neurological assessment on those deemed free of sedatives at > 96 hours post ROSC\n\nBased on ERC and ESICM guidelines\nWithdrawal of life sustaining treatment (WLST) not allowed prior to this for presumed poor neurological outcome, however decisions regarding WLST at discretion of treating team not prognosticator\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\u00a0\n\nFavorable neurological outcome (GOSE \u2265 5)\n43.5% (mild hypercapnia) vs 44.6% (normocapnia)\n\nAdjusted relative risk 0.98 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.11)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nComparing mild hypercapnia vs. normocapnia group\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nPoor functional outcome at 6 months (mRS of 4-6): 53.4 vs 51.3%\nDeath at ICU discharge: 38.0 vs 35.6%\nDeath within 6 months: 48.2 vs 45.9%\n\n\n\n\nSubgroups\n\nNo difference in any subgroup (age, sex, time from ROSC, initial rhythm or shock on admission)\n\n\nAdverse Events\n\nNo difference in adverse events\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe use of targeted mild hypercapnia in patients with OOHCA did not improve neurological outcomes at 6 months\n\nStrengths\n\nInternational, multi-centre RCT\nLarge numbers of patients recruited\nExcellent and rapid separation of PaCO2 which was maintained at target levels for duration of intervention\n\nMedian 2 hours to first achieve target (Figure S4)\nTime weighted PaCO2 averages across first 24 hours were 49.8 mmHg vs 40.8 mmHg (Figure S4)\n\n\nHigh adherence to protocol with detailed description of protocolized PaCO2 measurements in supplementary material\n\nAcknowledging the real-world challenges and complexities of keeping ventilatory parameters within strict targets in trials of this magnitude, a large proportion of measurements in range\n\n76% of all measurements in mild hypercapnia group > 45 mmHg, and 65% of all measurements in normocapnia group 35 \u2013 45 mmHg\n\n\n\n\nComprehensive screening log kept\nStandardized approach to WLST (withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies)\nPre-published statistical analysis plan and blinded manuscript written\n\nWeaknesses\n\nClinicians unblinded\nCO2\u00a0target abandoned in 5.6% of patients: 8% in mild hypercapnia group and 3% in normocapnia group (Table S3)\n7% missing data for primary outcome\n\nAuthors used different methods to account for missing of data with no change in outcome\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThere appears to be no benefit (or harm) to targeting mild hypercapnia and I will continue to target normocapnia in the absence of ventilatory challenges\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Mild Hypercapnia or Normocapnia after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac
