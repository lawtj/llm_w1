The incidence of adverse events was higher\n\nStrengths\n\nExcellently conducted RCT with high internal validity\nRapid placement of device following randomisation (14 minutes) with short door to balloon times\nA seemingly sick cohort with a median SBP in the 80s and lactate of 4.5, with well-balanced baseline characteristics\nSimilar use of other ICU supports between groups\nMinimal protocol violations\nMinimal loss to follow up\nClear guidelines on weaning of Impella support\nExcellent data on safety outcomes with clear definitions of what constitutes an adverse event\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnblinded\nWhen as-treated populations analysed confidence intervals lose significance (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.57 \u2013 1.03) (Figure S4)\nSingle centre in UK may limit external validity\n\nFigure S2 shows the heterogeneity of treatment effect across enrollment countries (Denmark vs Germany and UK) favours Denmark (not adjusted for multiplicity)\nIt is important to understand how long these devices have been used in each country to understand how and if volume of practice affects outcomes\n\n\nSlow enrollment \u2013 10 years to complete recruitment\n\nNo obvious difference in subgroup analysis\n\n\nData on safety outcomes doesn\u2019t account for competing risk (e.g. if you die you can\u2019t have RRT)\nDoes running on the highest support for 48 hours affect the risk of haemolysis?\n\nThis might increase AKI and need for RRT as hypothesised by the authors\nIt might be that the patients needed less support (lower setting) than the maximal settings to achieve adequate organ support, which may result in lower rates of haemolysis\nHowever, within the settings of a clinical trial it is understandable to protocolise these settings\n\n\nMay be hard to directly compare with other trials looking at mechanical cardiac supports (e.g. ECLS Shock)\n\nThis trial didn\u2019t include those comatose post cardiac arrest\n\nGiven this population will have a higher rate of neurological injury and therefore withdrawal of life sustaining therapies mortality rates may be different\nLow rates of neurological causes of death (6 patients total, Table S3) were demonstrated in this trial\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for other ICU support provided in protocol but no data provided on adherence (e.g. anticoagulation)\nSome industry involvement and support (Abiomed)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIt is hard to ignore this trial.\u00a0 Whilst acknowledging the increased rates of adverse events, the mortality benefit is striking\nThis trial should promote multi-disciplinary discussions around the potential benefit for MAFP use within local healthcare settings\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Microaxial Flow Pump or Standard Care in Infarct-Related Cardiogenic Shock\neditorial Mechanical Circulatory Support in Cardiogenic Shock \u2014 Persistence and Progress\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker @hgmwalker89\nSummary date: 12th April 2024\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\nPicture by: AI Generation Microsoft Co-Pilot\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
