This meant that a large number of patients in this group (68.2%) were actually intubated at a later stage but the majority were still intubated within 15 minutes\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\u00a0Survival to hospital discharge \u2013 significantly lower\u00a0in intubation group, p<0.001\n\nComparing no intubation vs. intubation\n\nUnadjusted analysis\n\n33.2% vs. 17%, risk ratio (RR) 0.58 (95% C.I. 0.57-0.59)\n12,116/36,464 vs. 12,140/71,615\n\n\nPropensity Score-Matched Analysis\n\n19.4% vs. 16.3%, RR 0.84 (95% C.I. 0.81-0.87)\n8,407/43,314 vs. 7,052/43,314\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nReturn of spontaneous circulation \u2013 significantly lower in intubation group, p<0.001\n\nUnadjusted analysis (data missing for 7 patients)\n\n69% vs. 59.2%, RR 0.75 (95% C.I. 0.73-0.76)\n\n\nPropensity Score-Matched Analysis (data missing for 7 patients)\n\n59.3% vs. 57.8%, RR 0.97 (95% C.I. 0.96-0.99)\n25,685/43,310 vs. 25,022/43,311\n\n\n\n\nFavourable functional outcome at discharge \u2013 significantly lower in intubation group, p<0.001\n\nUnadjusted analysis (data missing for 4,631 patients, 4.3%)\n\n25.7% vs. 11.2%, RR 0.55 (95% C.I. 0.54-0.56)\n\n\nPropensity Score-Matched Analysis (data missing for 3,027 patients, 3.5%)\n\n13.6% vs. 10.6%, RR 0.78 (95% C.I. 0.75-0.81)\n5,672/41,733 vs. 4,439/41,868\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSensitivity analysis (included patients with missing data)\n\nReported similar results for primary and secondary outcomes\n\n\nSub-group analysis for propensity matched \u2013 intubation vs. no intubation group\n\nSurvival to hospital discharge based on initial rhythm\n\nIntubation was associated with a significantly greater negative impact in patients with shockable vs. non-shockable rhythms\n\nShockable (n=13,321)\n\n26.8% vs. 39.2% (RR 0.68, 95% C.I. 0.65-0.72)\n\n\nNon-shockable (n=73,307)\n\n14.4% vs. 15.8% (RR 0.91, 95%C.I. 0.88-0.94)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn adult patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, early endotracheal intubation (<15minutes) compared with no intubation is associated with decreased survival to hospital discharge.\n\nStrengths\n\nLarge multi-centre study\nThe data set is large and generalisable to our population\nThe data set is from a prospective registry\nThe use of time-based propensity\u00a0attempts to minimise effects of confounding variables\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnsuccessful intubations not recorded or time taken to intubate which is likely to be a large confounding factor in outcome.\nPatients who are intubated may have greater severity of illness in the first place, and efforts to adjust for severity of illness may fail to fully account for residual indication bias\nIntubation may facilitate higher oxygen concentration delivery, which has been associated with harm, therefore it\u2019s not necessarily the intubation but the oxygen management that could be related to worse outcomes.\nPractices in resuscitation have changed over the 15 years of data collection\nControl patients are individuals who were not intubated during the same minute that an exposed case was intubated. However, these controls may become exposed cases in subsequent minutes. In the propensity matched groups, a number of patients that were intubated within 15 minutes were included in the no intubation group. These patients could have also been included in the intubation group.\nBaseline difference \u2013 significantly more patients with VF/VT and witnessed arrest in no intubation group; and significantly lower use of adrenaline\nDue to the difficulty of collecting accurate data during a cardiac arrest there is the \u00a0possibility of timings being misclassified\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients that have an in-hospital cardiac arrest the use of intubation was associated with an increased mortality. These results were\u00a0significant in both the unadjusted results and the propensity score-matched analysis. Due to weaknesses in the study design and concerns over possible missed confounding variables, further studies are required. This study has helped to demonstrate equipoise that should allow a RCT to be performed. In the mean time, this paper will certainly make me think twice before I reach for the laryngoscope. It also\u00a0highlights to me the importance of minimal interruptions to effective chest compressions and as always to make decisions on management of patients in a case-by-case fashion.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Association Between Tracheal Intubation During Adult In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest and Survival\n[further reading]\u00a0Association Between Arterial Hyperoxia Following Resuscitation From Cardiac Arrest and In-Hospital Mortality\n[further reading]\u00a0St Emlyns journal club: intubate or not intubate\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0David Harvie\nSummary date: 12/04/2017\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@davidslessor\n\n\n"
