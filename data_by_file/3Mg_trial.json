Lancet Respir Med 2013; 1: 293\u2013300\nClinical Question\n\nDoes intravenous or nebulised MgSO4 improve symptoms of breathlessness and reduce the need for hospital admission in adults with severe acute asthma?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\nDouble-blinded\nPlacebo-controlled\nMulti-centre\nIntention to treat analysis\n\nSetting\n\n34 Emergency Departments in the UK\n\nover 1/3 recruitments were from 3 ED\u2019s (Edinburgh, Sheffield and Bath)\n\n\n30th July 2008 to 30th June 2012\n\nPopulation\n\nAdults, aged over 16\nED attendees\nSevere acute asthma as defined by BTS Guidelines\n\nPEFR < 50% best or predicted\nRR > 25/min\nHR > 110/min\nInability to complete sentences in 1 breath\n\n\nExclusions\n\nLife-threatening asthma\n\nO2 sats < 92%; Silent chest; Cyanosis; Poor respiratory effort; Bradycardia; Arrhythmia; Hypotension; Exhaustion; Coma; Confusion\n\n\nContraindication to either nebulised or intravenous MgSO4\nPatients unable to give verbal or written consent\nPrevious participant in 3Mg trial\n\n\n\n\n1084 patients randomised and analysed on intention to treat basis\n\ntarget was 1200 patients but terminated early because funding expired\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nIntravenous MgSO4 (2g over 20 minutes) + standard BTS/SIGN guidelines\nNebulised MgSO4 (500mg x 3 at 20 minute intervals) + standard BTS/SIGN guidelines\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo + standard BTS/SIGN guidelines\n\nBTS/Sign standard therapy \u2013 oxygen, nebulised salbutamol (5mg), nebulised ipratropium (500mcg) and oral prednisilone. Other treatments were at the discretion of the clinician\n\n\nOutcome\n\nIn words\n\nPrimary outcomes\n\nNo difference in rates of admission to hospital between intervention and control groups\n\n285/394 (72%) \u00a0vs. 261/332 (79%) vs. vs. 281/358 (78%) patients were admitted to hospital before 7 days in the intravenous vs. nebulised vs. placebo group\nOdds ratio of 0.84 (CI 0.61 \u2013 1.15; p=0.276)\n\n\nNo difference in patient-reported visual analogue score (VAS) for breathlessness between intervention and control at 2 hours\n\n0mm (CI -1.9 \u2013 1.9; p=0.999)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nNo difference between intervention and control groups in:\n\nMortality (1 death each in intervention groups and none in control)\nUse of ventilation/respiratory support\nLength of hospital stay\nAdmission to HDU or ICU\nChange in PEFR and physiological variables\n\n\n\n\nIncreased incidence of side-effects up to 30 days in intervention compared to control groups\nTo be reported:\n\nChange in quality of life at 1 month\nNumber of unscheduled health-care contacts over subsequent month\nSatisfaction with care\n\n\n\nIn numbers\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nNebulised MgSO4 has no role in the management of severe acute asthma in adults and at best, only a limited role for intravenous MgSO4 in this setting.\n\nStrengths\n\nDouble blinded randomised controlled trial\n\ntreatment packs used which all contained an intravenous infusion and three nebuliser solutions\n\n\nMulti-centred\nControl group of established recommendations (BTS/SIGN)\nStudy registered ISRCTN04417063\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRecruitment was terminated early as funding expired\nUnderpowered: Designed to detect a 10% difference in admission rates\n\nrecruitment of 1200 patients would have meant 90% power to detect the planned 10% absolute reduction in proportion of patients admitted to hospital from ED.\nrecruitment of 1084 patients meant 84-87% power to detect a 10% absolute reduction in admission rate for interventions versus control\n\n\nProtocol amendment during the trial to also include individuals who had received MgSO4\u00a0in the 24 hour before recruitment\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis is the largest trial looking at the role of MgSO4 in the treatment of acute severe asthma in adults. I have never used nebulised MgSO4 to treat asthma in adults and this won\u2019t change. The use of intravenous MgSO4 in severe acute asthmatics is not without its side effects but I would still continue to use it in patients with life-threatening asthma. My expectation of achieving any significant clinical impact by giving 2g magnesium will remain low\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[original article full text]: Intravenous or nebulised magnesium sulphate versus standard therapy for severe acute asthma (3Mg trial) by Goodacre\n[podcast]: Magnesium in acute severe asthma; 3Mg trial.
