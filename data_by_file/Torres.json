JAMA 2015; 313(7):677-687. doi:10.1001/jama.2015.88\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia and high inflammatory response, does the use of corticosteroids compared to placebo improve outcome?\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre\nDouble-blind, randomised-controlled trial\nSample size calculation\n\n80% power to detect absolute risk reduction of 20% in treatment failure (assuming placebo group failure rate of 35%)\nSample size n = 60\nPre-specified interim analysis resulted in no change in sample size target\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n3 Spanish teaching hospitals\nJune 2004 \u2013 February 2012\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion\n\nAge > 18\nClinical symptoms suggestive of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)\nNew chest radiographic infiltrates\nSevere CAP as defined by either/or\n\nModified American Thoracic Society criteria for severe CAP\nPneumonia Severity Index risk class 4\n\n\nC-reactive Protein (CRP) > 150mg/L\n\n\nExclusion\n\nPrior treatment with systemic corticosteroids\nNosocomial pneumonia\nReported severe immunosuppression\nPre-existing medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 3 months\nUncontrolled diabetes mellitus\nMajor gastrointestinal bleed within 3 months\nCondition requiring acute treatment with > 1mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone equivalent\nH1N1 influenza A pneumonia\n\n\n519 screened, 120 patients randomised (61 to intervention, 59 to control)\n\nIntervention\n\nMethylprednisolone\n\n0.5mg/kg per 12 hours of methylprednisolone for 5 days\nCommenced within 36 hours of hospital admission\n\n\n\nControl\n\nIdentical placebo\n\nPlacebo injection every 12 hours for 5 days\nCommenced within 36 hours of hospital admission\n\n\n\nAntibiotic therapy according to international guidelines\nOutcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable defining primary outcome\n\n\n\n\nPrimary outcome: less overall (early + late) treatment failure occurred in the methylprednisolone group\n\nThis was predominantly due to a difference in late treatment failures, and specifically the occurrence of increased pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: there were no significant differences in the duration until stability, length of stay or mortality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of results\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong patients with severe CAP and high initial inflammatory response, the acute use of methylprednisolone compared to placebo decreased treatment failure.\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised, blinded, multi-centre\nPatients, investigators and data assessors were blinded\n\nIt\u2019s likely bedside clinicians were blinded too, although not explicitly stated\n\n\nTargeted severe CAP as defined by recognised definitions\nAdequate power calculation and observed baseline rate in control group approximated that assumed for the power calculation\n\nWeaknesses\n\nLong trial duration\n\nOther practices may have changed during the trial\nAuthors compared first 3 years against last 4 years and found no differences\nUnlikely to affect internal validity but generalisability may be reduced\n\n\nTreatment discontinued in 10% of patients in intervention group\nChoice and duration of antibiotics not specified\nUnusual composite primary outcome makes it difficult to clinically apply\n\nAuthors argue that \u2018treatment failure\u2019 is a surrogate for resource use and patient mortality\n\n\nFragility index = 2 (see further reading link below)\n\nIf 2 additional patients of the 61 in the intervention group had been \u2018treatment failures\u2019 then the result would have been non-significant (p > 0.05) and the conclusion may have been drawn differently\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study raises an interesting question, and the methodology to answer this is reasonable. However, the small numbers and composite, surrogate primary outcome limit the generalisability.\nThe authors are conducting a larger trial to investigate this further\nClinical practice should not be changed based upon this trial alone\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Article] Effect of Corticosteroids on Treatment Failure Among Hospitalized Patients With Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia and High Inflammatory Response\n[Editorial] Corticosteroids for Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia Not for Everyone\n[Further reading] Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society Consensus Guidelines on the Management of Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Adults\n[Commentary] A step forward in the early use of corticosteroids in SCAP by De Pascale and Mendoza for ESICM\n[Useful online tool] Online Pneumonia Severity Index Calculator\n[Vodcast]\u00a0Fragility Index presented by Dr Hutchinson\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @avkwong\nAdditional content:\u00a0@DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 24 March 2015\nPeer-review editor: @SteveMathieu75\n\n\n\n"
