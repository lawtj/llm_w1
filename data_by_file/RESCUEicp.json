Published on line 7th Sept; NEJM 2016; DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1605215\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and refractory intracranial hypertension, does decompressive craniectomy, result in more favourable mortality and neurological outcomes at 6 months, compared with barbiturate coma and continued medical management?\n\nDesign\n\nInternational, multicenter randomised controlled trial\nParallel group superiority\n1:1 randomiation with the use of permuted blocks of random sizes and with stratification according to trial sizes\nModified (excluded patients lost to follow up or withdrew consent) intention to treat analysis\nSample size of 400 patients was calculated to detect a 15% difference in favourable outcome rate between the two groups. A power of 80% allowed for a loss of follow-up of up to 15%\nThe primary outcome measure was analysed with an ordinal analysis method based on the proportional odds model\n\nSetting\n\n52 centres in 20 countries\n\nAll trial sites were hospitals that provide acute neurosciences care for patients with severe TBI and had access to 24 hour neurosurgical service\n71% of patients were recruited in the UK\n\n\nJan 2004 \u2013 March 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: patients with a TBI with an abnormal brain CT and raised intracranial pressure of >25mmHg for 1-12 hours, despite stage 1 and 2 measures; aged between 10 and 65 years\nExclusion: patients with bilateral fixed and dilated pupils, bleeding diathesis, or an injury that was considered to be unsurvivable\n2008 patients were assessed for eligibility; 408 randomised; data available for 389 patients at 6 months and 373 patients at 12 months\nBaseline characteristics of the groups were similar except that fewer patients in the craniectomy group had a history of drug or alcohol abuse. Characteristics of the craniectomy group versus the medical group were as follows:\n\nmean age: 32 vs. 35 years\nMale preponderance 82% vs. 80%\nGCS motor score of 1-2 at first hospital: 53% vs. 50%\nExtracranial injury: 37% vs. 42%\nInjury classification based on CT similar with diffuse injury accounting for over 2/3rd\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nDecompressive craniectomy\n\nContinued stage 1 and 2 treatments plus decompressive craniectomy\nEither large unilateral fronto-temporoparietal craniectomy (hemicraniectomy) for patients with unilateral hemispheric swelling or bifrontal craniectomy for patients with diffuse brain swelling\n\n\n\nControl\n\nMedical Group\n\nContinued stage 1 and 2 treatments plus barbiturates\n\n\n\nIn both groups\nStage 1 and stage 2 treatments were provided prior to stage 3 therapy (intervention or control group).\u00a0Stage 3 therapy was commenced if the intracranial pressure > 25mmHg for 1-2 hours after initiation of stage 2 therapy\nStage 1 therapy:\n\ninitial treatment measures: head elevation; ventilation; sedation; analgesia; paralysis (optional)\nmonitoring: central venous pressure; arterial blood pressure; intracranial pressure\n\nStage 2 therapy:\u00a0\n\ncommenced if intracranial pressure remained > 25mmHg after stage 1 therapy\nincluded: continuing stage 1 treatments and optional treatments. These included:\n\nventriculostomy; inotropes; mannitol; hypertonic saline; loop diuretics; hypothermia\nbarbiturares were NOT permitted\n\n\n\nPatients assigned to receive medical treatment alone could undergo a decompressive craniectomy later if their condition deteriorated further (37.2%). Similarly those patients assigned to undergo a decompressive craniectomy were permitted to receive a barbituarate infusion for the same indication (9.4%)\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) at 6 months after randomisation in the craniectomy vs. medical group was as follows:\n\nDeath: 26.9% vs. 48.9%\nVegetative state (VS): 8.5% vs. 2.1%\nLower severe disability (LSD): 21.9% vs. 14.4%\nUpper severe disability (USD): 15.4% vs. 8%\nLower moderate disability: 10% vs. 10.1%\nUpper moderate disability: 13.4% vs. 9.6%\nLower or upper good recovery: 2.5% vs. 3.2%\nUpper good recovery: 1.5% vs. 3.7%\nIf GOS-E is grouped into 3 categories \u2013 Dead, VS/LSD and USD or better\n\ncraniectomy group: 26.9%, 30.3%, 42.8%\nmedical group: 48.9%, 16.5%, 34.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nGOS-E at 12 months after randomisation in the craniectomy vs. medical group were as follows\n\ndeath was lower in the craniectomy group: 30.4% vs. 52%\nvegetative state (VS) was higher in the craniectomy group: 6.2% vs. 1.7%\nLower severe disability (LSD): 18% vs. 14%\nUpper severe disability (USD): 13.4% vs. 3.9%\nLower moderate disability: 10.3% vs. 7.8%\nUpper moderate disability: 11.9% vs. 12.3%\nLower or upper good recovery: 7.2% vs. 3.9%\nUpper good recovery: 2.6% vs. 4.5%\nIf GOS-E grouped into 3 categories \u2013 Dead, VS/LSD and USD or better\n\ncraniectomy group: 30.4%, 24.2%, 45.4%\nmedical group: 52%, 15.7%, 32.4%\n\n\n\n\nOverall it is estimated that for every 100 patients treated with decompressive craniectomy rather than medical intent, there were 22 more survivors; of these 22 patients,\u00a06 were in a vegetative state (27%), 8 were categorised\u00a0as having lower severe disability (36%), and\u00a08 were categorized as having upper severe disability\u00a0or better (36%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGCS at discharge from the neurosciences hospital\n\n18.9% in the craniectomy group vs. 12.2% in the medical group had GCS of 8 or less\n\n\nAssessment of intracranial pressure control: favoured the craniectomy group\nTime to death or discharge from ICU: no statistical difference in the median values. The median lengths of stay in ICU are 15 days in the craniectomy group and 20.8 days in the medical group\n\n\n% of patients with at least one reported complication or adverse event: statistically significant increase in the craniectomy group 15.3% vs. 9.2%\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAt 6 months, decompressive craniectomy in patients with TBI and\u00a0refractory intracranial hypertension resulted in lower mortality and higher rates of\u00a0vegetative state, lower severe disability, and upper severe disability than medical\u00a0care\n\nStrengths\n\nAll trial sites were hospitals that had immediate access to 24 hour neurosurgical services\nExploratory analyses examining the effect of covariate adjustment (age, GCS, motor score, pupillary reactivity, and the Marshall grade of the CT brain pre-randomisation) were pre-specified\nSimilar numbers of patients in the two groups received stage 1 and stage 2 treatments\nTiming for initiation of stage 3 treatment was similar in both groups\nAgreement for participation in the study was obtained from the next of kin preemptively on admission so that initiation of stage 3 therapy was not delayed\nRandomisation code was not released until the patient had reached stage 3 of the protocol\nExtended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) is a well validated global outcome measure to assess functional independence, work, social and leisure activities, and personal relationships\nExplanation provided for the reason that GOS-E results were reported descriptively at 6 months. The proportional-odds assumption was rejected\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSlow recruitment over 10 years with 50% of centres only recruiting 3 or fewer patients\nTherapeutic hypothermia (optional stage 2 treatment in this study) may have a deleterious effect on neurological outcome after TBI based on Eurotherm3235. The study was commenced before Eurotherm3235 was published. Whilst therefore not a criticism of the study design, this may have affected overall GOS-E\nClinical teams who cared for\u00a0the patients were aware of trial-group assignments\nA large proportion of patients in the medical\u00a0group underwent decompressive craniectomy (37%); this\u00a0situation may have diluted the observed treatment\u00a0effect\n10 patients were excluded\u00a0from all analyses owing to withdrawal of consent\nor to a lack of valid consent, and 7 more\u00a0patients in the medical group were lost to primary\u00a0follow-up\nLong term outcomes of survivors with severe disability would be useful. This follow up data may be planned for future?\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDecompressive craniectomy in patients with TBI and persistently raised intracranial pressure, after stage 1 and 2 management, was associated with lower mortality than medical management. However, more survivors in the surgical group than in the medical group were dependent on others. With data now available from DECRA and RESCUEicp, there is likely to be concern that life saving surgery may not predictably result in sufficiently good functional survival. Further investigations, exploring patient selection, longer term recovery and quality of life may be indicated\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Trial of Decompressive Craniectomy\u00a0for Traumatic Intracranial Hypertension\n[editorial]\u00a0Intracranial Pressure Rescued by Decompressive Surgery after Traumatic Brain Injury\n[further reading]\u00a0Decompressive Craniectomy in Diffuse Traumatic Brain Injury\n[further reading]\u00a0Decompressive Surgery Cuts Death in Traumatic Brain Injury\n[further reading] LITFL: RESCUEicp and the Eye of the Beholder\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Steve Mathieu\nSummary date: 8th September 2016\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler & Dave Slessor\n\n\n"
