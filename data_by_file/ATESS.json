ICM 2020 doi.org/10.1007/s00134-020-06191-3\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with septic shock, does the use of intravenous vitamin C and thiamine compared to standard therapy improve recovery from organ failure?\n\nBackground\n\nThe use of vitamin C in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock remains controversial and divides opinion within critical care\nThe initial before and after trial by Marik concluded that the early use of intravenous vitamin C, together with corticosteroids and thiamine may prove to be effective in preventing progressive organ dysfunction including acute kidney injury and reducing the mortality of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock\nSubsequently, the CITRIS-ALI trial did not show an improvement in organ recovery with the use of vitamin C in patients with sepsis although there was a reduction in mortality as a secondary outcome\nThe VITAMINS trial concluded that the combination of vitamin C, thiamine and steroids did not improve mortality or recovery from septic shock\n\nDesign\n\nMulticentre, double-blind, randomised-control trial\n1:1 randomisation by independent biostatistician\n\nPermuted block size of 4, stratification by site\n\n\nIntervention and control identically packaged\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nPower calculation\n\nBased on \u0394SOFA score from Marik study\nAssuming an effect size in \u0394SOFA of 1.5 in 72 hours, 116 patients were needed to have a 80% power, statistical significance of 5% and a dropout rate of 10%\n\n\nProtocol approved by individual Institutional Review Boards and the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in Korea\nWilcoxon Rank-Sum test used to compare \u0394SOFA scores\n\nSetting\n\n4 academic Emergency Departments in South Korea\nPatients recruited between December 2018 to January 2020\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adult patients who presented to ED and diagnosed with septic shocked (during their ED stay) defined as;\n\nSepsis (including suspected infection)\nPersisting hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP)\u226565 mmHg\nSerum lactate level>2 mmol/L despite adequate fluid challenge\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nTransferred from another hospital with vasopressor administration or\nmechanical ventilator support\nLimitations on treatment\nUnderlying terminal-stage disease\nTaking at least 1 g/day of vitamin C or receiving intravenous thiamine prior to enrollment\nCardiac arrest prior to enrollment\nRenal or ureteral stones\nReached inclusion criteria >24 hours after ED criteria\nPatient refusal (by themselves or by proxy)\nPregnancy\nG6PD deficiency/thalassaemia\nHyperoxaluria/cystinuria\nGout\nKnown hypersensitivity to any trial drugs\n\n\n554 screened, 116 randomised or which 111 included for final analysis\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nMale: 37.7% vs. 37.9%\nAge: mean 70 vs. 69\nHypertension: 35.9% vs. 41.4%\nDiabetes: 30.2% vs. 36.2%\nCardiac disease: 9.4% vs. 10.3%\nChronic lung disease: 7.6% vs. 5.2%\nSuspected focus of infection:\n\nRespiratory: 20.8% vs. 27.6%\nIntra-abdominal: 50.9% vs. 41.4%\nUrinary tract: 18.9% vs. 17.2%\n\n\nBlood culture-positive: 56.6% vs. 58.6%\nSOFA score at enrollment: median 8 vs. 8\nAPACHE2 score: median 22 vs. 22\nTime from ED arrival to 1st study drug administration: median 8.4hrs vs. 9.9hrs\nTime from meeting eligibility criteria to the first study drug administration: median 3.1hrs vs. 3.8hrs\nTime from randomisation to 1st drug: median 0.8hrs vs. 1.2hrs\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nVitamin C & thiamine\n\nCombined intravenous Vitamin C and thiamine mixed in 50mls 0.9% saline administered over 60 mins every 12 hrs for a total of 48 hours\nVitamin C dose: 50mg/kg (max single dose 3gm, daily dose 6gm)\nThiamine dose: 200mg\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\nIdentical volume of 0.9% saline at the same administration rate and frequency\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nInitial resuscitation and management as per latest Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines\n\nAt least 30mls/kg of intravenous crystalloid fluids administerd for pts with sepsis-induced hypoperfusion\nNorepinephrine first-choice vasopressor to maintain MAP > 65mmHg\nVasopressin (up to 0.03U/min) and hydrocortisone (200mg/day) added if norepinephrine dose > 0.2mcg/kg/min\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: \u0394SOFA (difference between scores at 72 hrs and initial SOFA at enrollment. If pt died within 72hrs, worst score before death used)\n\nNo significant difference between intervention and control group (median\u00a0\u0394SOFA 3 in both groups)\nSignificant changes were shown in plasma vitamin C and thiamine levels, and in proportions of deficient patients, in the intervention group compared to the control group\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nNo significant difference between intervention and control group\n\nMortality (7-day, 28-day, 90-day, in-hospital, ICU)\nShock reversal\nVasopressor free days and\u00a0dose (at 24, 48, and 72 h from enrollment and maximum dose during 72 h)\nDuration of mechanical ventilation and ventilator-free days\nNew-onset or worsening acute kidney injury (AKI)\nNew use of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and RRT-free\ndays\nICU length of stay (LOS), ICU-free days, hospital LOS\nReduction of CRP for 72 hrs\nReduction of procalcitonin for 72 hrs\n\n\n\n\nNo significant difference between intervention and control group in:\n\nAdjunctive steroid administered: 58.5% vs. 50%\nTime to 1st antibiotic: median 2.1hrs vs. 2.5hrs\nTime to 1st vasopressor: median 2hrs vs. 2.6hrs\nFluid administered before randomisation: median 2l vs. 2l\n\n\nNo adverse events in intervention group; mild events in 2 patients in control group\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn this multi-centre, double-blind RCT, vitamin C and thiamine administration compared with placebo for 48 h in the early phase of septic shock did not significantly improve organ function, despite improvements in vitamin C and thiamine levels\n\nStrengths\n\nDouble-blinded, randomised, placebo control trials\nPt dying within 72 hrs had the worse SOFA score used for analysis (as oppose to being excluded or given a score of 0)\nComprehensive baseline and co-intervention variables e.g. amount of fluid administered, collected and compared\nVitamin C and thiamine levels measured\nAdverse events reported\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPower calculation based on study whose results have not been reproduced\nIt isn\u2019t clear where these patients were managed after presentation (ED vs. ICU/HDU); the healthcare system and hence logistics in Korea may not be the same compared to other countries\nMajority of cases were enrolled from 2 centres; including one with a significantly higher mortality compared to the others\nThe primary outcome is not patient-centred\nEffects of vitamin C and thiamine not assessed separately\nAround 40% of patients in both groups had solid malignancies- this may limit the external validity of this trial outside of these patients\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis paper does not change my current practice and I will continue NOT to administer intravenous Vitamin C and thiamine routinely in patients with septic shock\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Combination therapy of vitamin C and thiamine for septic shock: a multi-centre, double-blinded randomized, controlled study\n[blog] The Vitamins trial.
