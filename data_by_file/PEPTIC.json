Published online January 17, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2019.22190\nClinical Question\n\nIn ICU patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, does the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) vs. histamine-2 receptor blockers (H2RBs) for stress-ulcer prophylaxis, reduce 90-day mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nUpper GI bleeding due to stress ulcers is a common complication of critical illness affecting 2.5% of patients admitted to ICU\nProphylaxis against stress ulcers is widely accepted as standard ICU practice but there is wide variation in the choice of drugs\nAlthough PPIs may be more effective than H2RBs in suppressing gastric acid secretion and preventing upper GI bleeding, there has been concern that they may also increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, Clostridioides difficile infection, and immunosuppression\n\nDesign\n\nPragmatic, open-label, cluster randomised crossover design, meaning whole units used one class of drug as their default for 6 months, then the other\nPrimary outcome changed in March 2017 prior to any data analysis\nPower calculation: 80% power to detect an absolute reduction of 2.4% from a baseline mortality of 15%, with a false positive rate of 5%\n\nSetting\n\n50 ICUs in 5 countries\n2016-2019\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAged 18 years or older\nRequiring invasive mechanical ventilation\nWithin 24 hours or ICU admission\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nICU admission diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding\n\n\n26,771 patients included in primary analysis out of 26,982 patients randomised\nIntervention & control group well matched at baseline\nMean age 58 years\nMean APACHE II score = 19\nStudy used existing registries to gather data, making it feasible to conduct such a large trial within a reasonable budget\n\nIntervention\n\nProton pump inhibitor\n\nUse of PPI as default stress-ulcer prophylaxis for the unit\nCrossover: 5% of patients in PPI group were given H2RB\nMedian time available for exposure to stress ulcer prophylaxis was 2.7 days\n\n\n\nControl\n\nHistamine-2 Receptor Blocker\n\nUse of H2RB as default stress-ulcer prophylaxis for the unit\nCrossover: 20% of patients in H2RB group were given PPI\nMedian time available for exposure to stress ulcer prophylaxis was 2.7 days\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nRequirement for stress ulcer prophylaxis in individual patients was as the discretion of the treating clinicians\nPatients who were taking long-term PPI or H2RB before admission were to switch to the mandated drug when admitted to the participating ICU\nClinicians could also use discretion to override the mandated drug (whether H2RB or PPI)\nPPI were always used for treatment of any upper GI bleeds that did develop\nAll other therapy was at clinician\u2019s discretion\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\n90 day in-hospital mortality \u2013 no significant difference\n\n18.3% for the PPI group vs. 17.5% for the H2RB\ngroup (95% CI for risk ratio of PPI vs H2RB was 1.00 \u2013 1.10)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: comparing PPI vs. H2RB groups\n\nClinically important upper GI bleeding \u2013 significantly lower in the PPI group\n\n1.3% vs.\u00a0 1.8%\nRelative risk 0.73 (95% CI 0.57 \u2013 0.92)\n\n\nClostridium difficile infection \u2013 no significant difference\n\n0.3% vs. 0.43%\nRelative risk 0.74 (95% C.I. 0.51-1.09)\n\n\n90 day in-hospital mortality in patients who had cardiac surgery \u2013 significantly increased in PPI group\n\nRelative Risk 1.27 (95% CI, 1.04-1.57)\n\n\n\n\nTertiary outcomes:\n\nMedian hours until removed alive from mechanical ventilation \u2013 no significant difference\n\n48 vs. 48\n\n\nVentilator associated conditions \u2013 no significant difference\n\n\u00a06.5% vs. 5.8%\nRelative risk 1.18 (95% C.I. 0.87-1.59)\n\n\n\n\nPost-Hoc Analysis:\n\nDifference in mortality was mostly found in the group of patients with high illness severity, comparing primary outcome\u00a0 for PPI vs. H2RB according to patients\u2019 APACHE II scores:\n\nAPACHE II score 0-13: 3.7% vs. 4.0%, RR 0.92 (95% C.I. 0.77-1.11)\nAPACHE II score 14-17: 7.1% vs. 7.5%, RR 0.96 (95% C.I. 0.86-1.08)\nAPACHE II score 18-23: 17.5% vs. 14.7%, RR 1.15 (95% C.I. 1.05-1.25)\nAPACHE II score 24-61: 45.3% vs. 43.5%, RR 1.05 (95% C.I. 1.00-1.11)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation, a strategy of stress ulcer prophylaxis with use of proton pump inhibitors vs histamine-2 receptor blockers resulted in hospital mortality rates of 18.3% vs 17.5%, respectively, a difference that did not reach the significance threshold. However, study interpretation may be limited by crossover in the use of the assigned medication\n\nStrengths\n\nHighly relevant clinical question, applying to the majority of ventilated ICU patients\nWorldwide recruitment from a large number of ICUs giving a high level of external validity\nHighly powered study due to large number of clusters and cluster-cross over design (post-trial recalculation suggested even greater power than original power calculation)\nThe pragmatic design is well suited to answering the question, \u201cwhat would be the impact of making this drug the default for stress ulcer prophylaxis in our ICU?\u201d\nIf real, the point estimate of 0.8% absolute risk reduction with H2RB vs PPI, although small, would be clinically very significant, given the very large number of patients given this prophylaxis worldwide\nAlthough the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was 1.00, this does still give a clear answer that it is much more likely that mortality is increased with PPI, than reduced with PPI\nLow risk of selection bias, with good baseline balance (e.g. mean APACHE II score of 18.7 in both groups) and minimal loss to follow up. Sensitivity analysis was performed for missing data using worst-best and best-worse case scenarios\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThere was a large proportion of crossover from the intervention arm to the control arm, particularly when units were randomised to using H2RB as default prophylaxis (20% crossover to PPI). This would probably bias towards finding no difference between groups, but it is impossible to know for certain\nThere was a lack of detailed patient-by-patient data, making it difficult to assess the effect of a drug on individuals (as opposed to the unit-wide effect of implementing the strategy). For instance, data on ventilator associated conditions was only available from the 8 Canadian ICUs\nData obtained from registries may be subject to random error\nExisting databases and the data extracted varied in different jurisdictions, which likely contributed to geographical differences in study findings. For instance, higher rates of GI bleeding identified in Canada compared to Australia and New Zealand may due to more sensitive data collection methods\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAlthough a default strategy of PPI for stress-ulcer prophylaxis in ICU resulted in significantly lower rates of GI bleed (absolute risk reduced by 0.5%), it was also associated with an increase in 90-day hospital mortality compared with H2RB (absolute risk increased by 0.8%).\nThe 95% confidence interval for the relative risk of mortality included 1.0 (1.00-1.10) so the finding is reported as not \u201cstatistically significant\u201d, however it is more likely that PPI prophylaxis increases mortality than reduces mortality compared with H2RB\nThis study supports H2RB as the default agent for stress ulcer prophylaxis in ICU, despite the uncertainty noted above. PPI therapy remains appropriate for patients with evidence of upper GI bleeding\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis With Proton Pump Inhibitors vs Histamine-2 Receptor Blockers on In-Hospital Mortality Among ICU Patients Receiving Invasive Mechanical Ventilation\n[Editorial] Proton Pump Inhibitors vs Histamine-2 Receptor Blockers for Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis in Critically Ill Patients Issues of Interpretability in Pragmatic Trials\n[further listening] Video of Presentation and Discussion at Critical Care Reviews 2020\n[further reading] SUP-ICU trial: PPI vs. placebo\n[further reading] PulmCrit \u2013 An alternative view of the PEPTIC trial\n[further reading] Tweetorial from Paul Young\n\n\u00a0\nMetadata\nSummary author: Nick Tarmey\nSummary date: 23rd January 2020\nPeer-review editor: Chris Nickson @precordialthump\n\n\n"
