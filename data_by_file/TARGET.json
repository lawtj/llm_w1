The optimal route of delivery and optimal caloric targets has been a controversial subject over many decades\nWe know:\n\nEnteral nutrition is preferable to parenteral nutrition (reduced chance of gastric erosion, bacterial translocation and infectious complications)\nEarly establishment of feeds is desirable but not always possible\nIt is difficult to achieve caloric goal targets, due to the complex nature of the intensive care patient with interruptions in feeds for procedures, high gastric aspirates, vomiting etc\n\n\n\n\nThe research to date has not answered \u00a0what we should aim for in regards to caloric targets.\n\nSome trials have examined early trophic feeding (~400kcal/day): EDEN RCT, some have examined standard calories (~1300kcal/day) and some have studied energy-dense nutrition (~1900kcal/day) ACCEPT trial. There have been little or no differences in mortality and other outcomes between control and intervention groups in these trials\n\n\nGuidelines (Canadian CC, ESPEN and ASPEN) have offered advice regarding caloric goals and have erred on the side of higher energy targets. (25-30kcal/kg/day ~1900-2200cal/day)\n\nDesign\n\nTARGET: The Augmented versus\u00a0Routine approach to Giving Energy\u00a0Trial\nMulticentre, double-blind, RCT\n1:1 assignment to groups using permuted block randomisation, variable block size, site stratification\nAllocation concealment achieved by web-based randomisation\nBlinding achieved by indistinguishable packaging between the energy-dense and routine feeds\nA sample size of 3774 provided 80% power to detect a difference of 3.8-4.3 percentage points in 90-day mortality assuming a baseline mortality of 20-30%. Sample size\u00a0was increased to 4000 to allow for loss of follow-up\nAnalyses was by modified intention to treat\n\nSetting\n\n46 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand\nJune 2016 to November 2017 (with 90 day follow-up)\n4000 \u00a0were randomised\n\n26 in high energy group and 17 in routine group were excluded from the modified ITT evaluation due to withdrawal of consent, not meeting all inclusion/exclusion\n23 in high energy group and 20 in routine group were excluded due to later withdrawal of consent or loss to follow-up\n\n\n3914 patients were available for analysis of the primary outcome\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: All ICU patients, 18 years and older, invasively ventilated and expected to be requiring enteral nutrition until at least the day after randomisation\nExclusion: patient had already received EN or PN >12 hours in this ICU admission, treating team felt 1ml/kg contraindicated, death deemed imminent, burns >15%\n\n\nPatients well matched at baseline, particularly with similar APACHE II scores and requirements for organ support\n\nIntervention\n\nEnergy dense feed\n\nTarget rate of 1ml/kg of 1.5kcal/ml of enteral feed based on ideal body weight (~1900kcal/day)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard feed\n\n\u00a0Target rate of 1ml/kg of 1kcal/ml of enteral feed based on ideal body weight (~1300kcal/day)\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nThe feeds differed in caloric content achieved by higher fat and carbohydrate in the energy dense feed but there was similar protein content in the 2 feeds\nOther management was at the discretion of the treating teams\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: All cause 90-day mortality: 1.5kcal/ml vs 1kcal/ml; no difference\n\n523/1948 (26.8%) vs 505/1966 (25.7%) [RR 1.05; 95% CI, 0.94-1.16, p=0.41]\n\n\nSecondary outcome: no difference in any secondary outcome\n\nSurvival time\n90-day cause specific mortality\nICU-free and hospital-free days (until D28)\nDays free of organ support (until D28)\n% ventilated, vasopressors or new RRT (D28)\n% with Positive blood cultures\nAntimicrobials received between randomisation & D28\nSeven pre-specified subgroups:\n\nAge >65\nTrauma\nSepsis\nNeurological\nMedical vs Surgical patients\nQuintiles for absolute risk of death\nBMI\n\n\n\n\nGI tolerance and metabolic effects\n\nGastric residual volumes were significantly higher in the high energy group (250ml vs 180ml)\nRegurgitation and vomiting were more prevalent in the high energy group (19 vs. 16%)\nThe use of insulin was more prevalent in the high energy group (56 vs 49%)\nProkinetic drug use was more prevalent in the high energy group (47 vs 40%)\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nEnergy dense enteral nutrition did not improve 90-day survival amongst ventilated ICU patients\n\nStrengths\n\nMulticentred, double-blinded, allocation concealment, good follow-up, intention-to-treat- analysis\nClinically meaningful outcomes\nPrespecified subgroups\nAddresses a clinically important question and is the largest critical care nutrition trial ever undertaken\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOnly 2% of patients were malnourished as assessed by BMI. The generalisability of this study \u00a0to this patient group is difficult to make\nThe trial was conducted only in Australia and NZ making the extrapolation to ICUs in other settings, eg developing countries, challenging\nProtein intake was the same between groups. There is no assessment of the value of hyperproteinemic feeds\nClinically important subgroups were predefined but a heterogenous ICU population does not exclude a benefit of different caloric targets in certain groups that was not detected in this study (either because no difference exists or the study was not powered to detect the difference in these subgroups)\nThe caloric targets were calculated using ideal body weight. The evidence is scant, but some would advocate that calorimetry assessing energy expenditure should be the gold standard in these patients\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial provides reassurance to me that my usual practice of providing 1ml/kg (actual weight) of standard feed (1kcal/ml) is safe for my mechanically ventilated ICU patients\nMy patient may also receive some calories from propofol, citrate dialysis and dextrose infusions but this is unlikely to alter outcomes greatly\nI look forward with interest to the results of the 6-month quality of life follow-up for these patients which is yet to be published\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Energy-Dense versus Routine Enteral Nutrition in the Critically Ill\n[further reading]\u00a0What should we target after TARGET?
