JAMA 2012; 308(19):1985-92.\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients who are mechanically ventilated and sedated with opioids and / or benzodiazepines, do daily sedative interruptions reduce the duration until extubation?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\n65-patient 3-centre pilot trial conducted previously\nBlock randomisation according to centre\nAllocated by automated telephone system\nNo blinding attempted\n\nSetting\n\n14 Canadian and 2 US intensive care units\nJanuary 2008 \u2013 July 2011\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: expected to require at least 48 hours mechanical ventilation; ICU team had initiated continuous sedative / opioid infusion.\nExclusion: cardiac arrest, traumatic brain injury, administration of neuromuscular blocking drugs.\n2091 screened of which 430 randomised\n\nIntervention\n\nOpioid and benzodiazepine infusions were stopped daily.\nThey were restarted at half the previous rate when deemed necessary by the bedside clinician.\n\nMean SAS score was 3.28 (95% CI 2.92\u20133.85)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNo planned daily interruption\n\nMean SAS score was 3.23 (95% CI 3.0\u20133.71)\n\n\n\n\nBoth groups were sedated by opioids (morphine or fentanyl) for pain and benzodiazepines (midazolam or lorazepam) for agitation.\nHourly assessment by either Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale or the Sedation\u2013Agitation Scale directed the titration either up or down of these drugs.\nTarget SAS score was 3 (sedated but rousable) to 4 (calm and cooperative) \u2013 \u201clight\u201d sedation\n\nComparable RASS score is -3 to 0.\n\n\nThe bedside nurse chose whether to titrate opioids or benzodiazepines.\nPropofol, ketamine and dexmedetomidine were not allowed.\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: there was no difference in median time to successful extubation.\n\nmedian days to extubation 7 days in both groups (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.86\u20131.35; p=0.52)\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\na priori sub-group analysis demonstrated a reduced median duration to extubation in trauma and surgical patients, and no difference in medical patients.\nNurse workload was significantly higher in the intervention group.\nThere were no differences in accidental event rates\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn critically ill patients who are mechanically ventilated, when nurses implement a sedation protocol that targets light sedation, the use of daily sedative interruptions does not reduce the duration until extubation and may increase both the amount of sedative administered and the nursing workload.\n\nStrengths\n\nJust 7 lost-to-follow-up due to withdrawal of consent. Unlikely to affect result significantly.\nPragmatic design: did not use additional research nurses at bedside.\nMulti-centre and mixed patient cohorts (surgical and medical) increases generalisability.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPhysician refusal to enrol 10.8% of screened patients. Selection bias?\nRe-intubation rate 5.6% and 7.7%; Tracheostomy rate 23.2% and 26.3%. Perhaps higher than UK practice? Might reduce external validity (generalisability).\nAdherence was poor:\n\nDaily interruption were administered on 85.6% of all eligible patient-days.\n53% of patients missed at least 1 daily interruption and 6 missed every daily interruption!\nInfusions were restarted at higher than 50% for 14% of eligible patients.\nPropofol use occurred on 3% and 2% of study days for intervention and control groups respectively.\nInterruptions occurred in 16% of control patients, accounting for 2.3% of study days.\nThese are likely to reduce any true difference and will bias toward a more neutral result. They emphasise the difficulty in implementing sedation breaks consistently.\n\n\nDid not allow Propofol, which is widely used for sedation on ICU. Benzodiazepines used less widely now? Reduces generalisability.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIf a sedation protocol is used to target \u201clight\u201d sedation within an ICU, daily interruptions are not shown to be beneficial, are very hard to implement consistently and may increase nursing workload.\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf / abstract / doi: 10.1001/jama.2012.13872\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\nKress.\u00a0The Changing Landscape of ICU Sedation.\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 10th May 2014\nPeer-review editor: @stevemathieu75\n\n\n\n"
