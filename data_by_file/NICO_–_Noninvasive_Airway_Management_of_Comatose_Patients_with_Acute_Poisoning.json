DOI: 10.1001/jama.2023.24391\nClinical Question\n\nIn adults with a decreased conscious level from suspected acute poisoning, does withholding intubation versus routine practice reduce in-hospital death, and length of ICU stay and hospital stays?\n\nBackground\n\nThe decision to intubate a poisoned patient with GCS < 9 is widely debated\u00a0\nThe risks of not intubating include aspiration. However, these risks need to be balanced with the risk of the intubation itself\nThere is no high-level evidence assessing which strategy is optimal\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, open label, randomized controlled trial\nInvestigator-initiated\nUnblinded trial due to nature of intervention\nRandomisation in a 1:1 ratio using sealed envelopes and stratified by hospital and block balanced\n\nRandomisation occurred in an ambulance or in the Emergency Department\n\n\nThe Win Ratio (WR) was used to assess primary outcome\n\nThis is a hierarchical composite end point that compares the number of wins against the number of losses across all possible pairs (between intervention and control groups) for each component of the composite end point\n\nA win is recorded when a more favourable event occurs e.g. survival, shorter length of stay (LOS)\nA tie occurs if the event is the same in both groups e.g. both survive\n\n\nWR = Total Wins / Total Losses\n\nA WR of 1.2 implies there are 20% more wins in the intervention group\n\n\n\n\n240 patients required based on sample size calculation\n\n98% power to detect a difference at an alpha of 0.05\n3% mortality with a difference of 1 day in ICU LOS (0 v 1) and 2 days in hospital LOS (2 v 4)\nAllowed for 10% loss to follow up and 10% refusal of consent\n\n\nDelayed written informed consent obtained\nRegistered at clinicaltrials.gov\n\nSetting\n\n20 Emergency Departments and 1 ICU in France.\nMay 2021 to April 2023\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAge \u2265 18 years\nClinical suspicion of acute poisoning (either alcohol, drug or medication)\nGCS \u2264 8\n\n\nExclusion:\nThese included:\n\nImmediate need for intubation\n\nRespiratory failure (SpO2 < 90% with oxygen provided by nasal cannula (\u2264 4 l/min), clinical signs of respiratory distress)\nShock: sustained SBP < 90 mmHg despite 1L fluid resuscitation\nSuspicion of brain injury (witnessed seizure or acute cerebral aggression)\n\n\nSuspected Cardiotropic drugs poisoning (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors)\nSuspected sole intoxication with toxic for which there is an antidote\n\n\n237 patients randomised\n\n225 in primary analysis population\n8 patients withdrew and 4 patients were withdrawn as had protected measures in place\n\n\nBaseline characteristics were generally well balanced (restricted intubation vs. control group):\n\nAge: 33 vs 34\nFemale: 40 vs 36%\nRandomised in ED: 63 vs 61%\nSBP: 114 vs 118 mmHg\nRespiratory Rate: 17 vs 17 bpm\nPeripheral SpO2: 97 vs 97%\nGCS: 6 vs 6\nBMI: 25 vs 24\nToxins (several may have been involved):\n\nEtoH: 68 vs 65%\nBenzodiazepines: 39 vs 40%\nGHB/GBL: 12 vs 10%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nIntubation withheld unless emergency criteria for intubation evolved\n\nReasons included presence of regurgitation, seizure, shock, or sign of respiratory distress\n\n\nAssessment of GCS every 30 minutes until GCS > 8\n18% intubated\n\nControl\n\nIntubation decision at discretion of treating physician\n60% intubated\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll intubations performed following the guidelines of the French society of intensive care medicine for rapid sequence intubation\nPre-oxygenation aiming at maintaining a 100% SpO2 for 2 minutes\nChoice of direct or video laryngoscopy was left to the discretion of the physician\nPost-intubation measurement of CO2 with capnography was recommended\nAfter 4 hours intervention was complete and standard treatment was continued\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\nThe hierarchical composite end point of in-hospital death, ICU and hospital LOS was improved in the restricted intubation group\nWin Ratio: 1.85 (95% CI 1.33 \u2013 2.58, p < 0.001)\n\nNo patients died in either group\nIntervention group lower median length of ICU stay:\n\n0 hours vs 24 hours; RR: 0.39 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.66).\n\n\nIntervention median length of hospital stay:\n\n22 hours compared to 37 hours; RR: 0.74 (0.53 to 1.03)\n\n\n\n\n18% intubated in restricted arm vs. 60% in control arm\n\nAbsolute risk difference -42.5% (95% CI -54.1 to -30.9)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nNo increased rates of pneumonia: 7 vs 15%\n\nOR 0.43 (95% CI 0.18 \u2013 1.05)\n\n\nLower percentage of intervention group admitted to ICU: 40% vs 66%\n\nOR 0.23 (95% CI 0.12 \u2013 0.44)\n\n\nIn those who were intubated there was no difference in intubation adverse effects and median ICU / hospital LOS\n\n\nPre-specified subgroups:\n\nGCS < 7: Win Ratio 1.70 (95% CI 1.10 \u2013 2.64)\nEtOH, Benzodiazepines, GHB/GBL: Win Ratio 1.42 (95% CI 0.88 \u2013 2.32)\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nWithholding intubation in comatose patients with suspected acute poisoning was associated with greater clinical benefit for the composite end point of in-hospital death, length of ICU stay, and length of hospital stay\n\nStrengths\n\nSpecifically assessed patient centered outcomes (mortality, ICU and hospital LOS) as compared to aspiration pneumonia which had been reported in prior studies\n\nThe use of a hierarchical composite endpoint is appropriate given differences in the patient importance of the different components of the composite endpoint\n\n\nPragmatic as study design allowed flexibility in what was defined as standard management\n\nNoted that 40% of control group were not intubated\n\n\nStudy powered appropriately for primary outcome\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnblinded\n\nMay have influenced decisions around intubation\n\n\nPrimary hierarchical outcome driven mostly by length of ICU stay outcome\n\n\u00a01 in 5 patients were not admitted to ICU, and no deaths in the study groups\nThis is important given the potential difference in disposition for those intubated compared to those who are not (especially in France where the ambulance service brings intubated patients directly to the ICU)\n\n\nWide ranging exclusion criteria limit generalisability to all patients with suspected poisoning\nNo documentation around seniority of who was intubating patients or devices / adjuncts used\n\nFirst pass failure of ~13% in control group\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with a GCS <8 due to simple acute poisoning with no other adverse features, close monitoring and delaying intubation for up to 4 hours reduces ICU admissions and ICU LOS\n\nExternal Links\n\nEffect of Noninvasive Airway Management of Comatose Patients With Acute Poisoning A Randomized Clinical Trial\nSafety of withholding intubation in gamma hydroxybutyrate and gamma-butyrolactone-intoxicated coma patients in the emergency department paper\nEndotracheal intubation to reduce aspiration events in acutely comatose patients: a systematic review\nThe win ratio approach for composite endpoints: practical guidance based on previous experience\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Thomas Judd @drtomjudd\nSummary date: 12th April 2024\nPeer-review editor: George Walker\nPicture by: frolicsomepl/Pixabay\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
