JAMA. Published online June 03, 2019321(23):2292\u20132305. doi:10.1001/jama.2019.7505\nClinical Question\n\nIn obese patients, does the use of recruitment maneuvers with high PEEP, compared with low PEEP, decrease postoperative pulmonary complications?\n\nBackground\n\nPrior studies have identified the use of PEEP and low tidal volumes for reduction of major pulmonary complications compared to high tidal volumes and zero PEEP\nNo benefit was found in these patients with the use of high PEEP and recruitment compared to low PEEP strategies\nObese patients have greater levels of atelectasis and impairments in respiratory function under general anesthesia compared to normal weight or overweight patients\nThere is uncertainty whether higher PEEP with recruitment is beneficial in preventing postoperative pulmonary complications in these patients\nWith an increasing prevalence of obesity, the burden of postoperative pulmonary complications may increase significantly\n\nDesign\n\nInternational, multicentre RCT with protocol and statistical analysis plan published a priori\nCentralized randomization and 1:1 allocation\nRandom block sizes, stratified by study site\nOutcome assessors were blinded, intraoperative clinicians and assessors were not blinded\nSample size increased after initial interim analysis demonstrated that incidence of primary outcome was lower than expected\nAssuming 20% rate of pulmonary complications, sample size of 2013 would have 80% power to detect Relative Risk of 0.75 for the primary outcome at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nPre-specified subgroups: Laparoscopy vs non-laparoscopy, baseline SpO2 > 96% vs. < 96%, BMI > 40 vs. < 40, peripheral vs. upper abdominal procedures, waist-to-hip ratio < 1.0 vs. > 1.0\n\nSetting\n\n77 sites in 23 countries internationally, primarily in Europe\nEnrolment from July 2014 to February 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nBMI > 35\nSurgery > 2 hours (laparoscopy or non-laparoscopy)\nIntermediate to High risk of pulmonary complications as calculated by Assess Respiratory Risk in Surgical Patients in Catalonia Score (ARISCAT) > 26\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nPatient Factors:\n\nAge < 18 years, previous lung surgery, mechanical ventilation in past 30 days for > 30 minutes, Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy in 2 months prior to surgery, concurrent participation in another study, persistent hemodynamic instability/intractable shock, severe COPD, severe cardiac disease, ARDS, pulmonary hypertension\n\n\nProcedural Factors:\n\nCardiac/Neurological surgery, intraoperative one-lung ventilation, planned reintubation postoperatively, intraoperative prone or lateral positioning\n\n\n\n\n2013 patients randomized in total. 29 patients excluded post randomization. 8 patients lost to follow up. 1976 patient included in intention to treat analysis (989 intervention, 987 control)\nComparison of baseline demographics\n\nMean age of 48.8 years with 69.9% female, 90.1% undergoing abdominal surgery\nNo differences in:\n\nAverage BMI (43.8), ARISCAT score, total fluids, transfusion, use of epidural, neuromuscular blockade, surgical & anesthetic duration, anesthetic technique, type of surgery, use of NIV, ASA score, OSA, Tobacco use, COPD, Heart failure or preoperative hemoglobin, SpO2\n\n\nStatistically significant intraoperative ventilation differences during 1st hour of surgery, comparing high vs. low PEEP groups:\n\nPeak pressure: 27.9 vs 26.5cmH2O, Absolute Difference (AD) 1.4 (95% C.I. 1.0 to 1.9)\nDriving pressure: 12.2 vs 17.9cmH2O, AD -5.7 (-6.1 to -5.2)\nSpO2: 97.9 vs 96.6%, AD1.3 (1.1 to 1.5)\nFiO2: 0.45 vs 0.48, AD 0.02 (-0.03 to -0.01)\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nHigh PEEP with recruitment manoeuvre\n\nPEEP of 12cmH2O (SD 1.1cmH2O)\nHourly recruitment manoeuvre\nStepwise increase in tidal volume and PEEP to achieve Pplat of 40-50 cm H2\nHypoxemia treated primarily with increase in PEEP before FiO2 increased\n\n\n\nControl\n\nLow PEEP\n\nPEEP of 4cmH2O (SD 0.5cmH2O)\nHypoxemia treated primarily with increase in FiO2 only\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nVolume controlled ventilation at 7mL/kg (Predicted Body Weight)\nFiO2 titrated to keep SpO2 > 92% (not lower than 0.4)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Composite incidence of pulmonary complications including any respiratory failure, ARDS, bronchospasm, infiltrate, infection, aspiration, effusion, atelectasis, cardiopulmonary edema or pneumothorax that developed within the first 5 post-operative days\n\nComparing high PEEP vs. low PEEP groups \u2013 no significant difference\n\n21.3% vs 23.6%, AD -2.3 (-5.9 to 1.4), Relative Risk (RR) 0.93 (0.83-1.04) p = 0.23\n\n\n\n\nComponents of primary outcome\n\nMild respiratory failure: 12.7% vs. 15.6% , AD -1.9% (-5.1 to 1.2%), p=0.22\nPleural effusion: 4.3% vs 2.1%, AD2.2 (0.7-3.8), RR 1.35 (1.14 to 1.62), p = 0.005\nNo difference in any other components of composite score\n\n\nNo difference with pre-specified subgroup analysis\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nIntraoperative adverse events:\n\nHypoxemia with SpO2 < 92% for > 1 minute \u2013 significantly lower in high PEEP group\n\n5% vs 13.6%, AD -8.6 (-11.1 to -6.1), RR 0.51 (0.40 to 0.65), p < 0.001\n\n\nHypotension with SBP < 90mmHg for > 2 minutes \u2013 significantly greater in high PEEP group\n\n31.6% vs 17.2% , AD14.4 (10.7 to 18.2), RR 1.43 (1.31 to 1.56), p < 0.001\n\n\nBradycardia with HR < 50 prior to recruitment maneuver \u2013 significantly greater in high PEEP group\n\n9.9% vs 6.0%, AD3.9 (1.5 to 6.3), RR 1.27 (1.11 to 1.45), p = 0.001\n\n\n\n\nPostoperative Events:\n\nExtrapulmonary complications (sepsis, ACS, AKI, DIC, liver failure) \u2013 no significant difference\nHospital mortality \u2013 no significant difference\n\n1.2% vs. 0.5%, AD 0.7 (-0.1 to 1.5), p=0.09\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Hoc Outcomes\n\nIntra-operative rescue strategy for desaturation \u2013 significantly greater in low PEEP group\n\n6% vs. 16.8%, AD -10.8 (-13.6 to -8.1), p<0.001\n\n\nIntra-operative need for vasoactive drugs \u2013 significantly greater in high PEEP group\n\n49.6% vs. 44.5%, AD 5.2 (0.8-9.6), p=0.02\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIntraoperative mechanical ventilation with a strategy involving high PEEP and recruitment did not reduce postoperative pulmonary complications compared to low PEEP strategy in obese patients under general anesthesia\n\nStrengths\n\nAdequately powered study with adjusted sample size\nMulti-centre\nGeneralizable population with minimal inter-group differences, of questionable clinical importance\nIntention to treat analysis with minimal exclusion post-randomization\n\nWeaknesses\n\nLack of intraoperative blinding given pragmatic design\nNo individual PEEP titration\nLack of standardization of postoperative pulmonary management (ex CPAP vs HFNC vs FM, etc)\nUse of composite outcome that included outcomes of variable importance\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn obese patients undergoing general anesthesia, a strategy with higher PEEP and recruitment maneuvers does not prevent post-op pulmonary complications\nIntra-operative oxygenation and pulmonary mechanics may be improved at the risk of increased vasopressor support\n\nExternal
