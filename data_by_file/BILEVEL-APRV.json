Intensive Care Medicine 2017; 43:1648-1659. doi:10.1007/s00134-017-4912-z\nClinical Question\n\nIn mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS, does airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) compared to conventional low tidal volume ventilation (LTV) reduce duration of mechanical ventilation?\n\nBackground\n\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory process featuring increased lung vascular permeability resulting in hypoxaemia and reduced lung compliance\nConventional ventilation is based upon the ARMA trial, which has become known as \u2018ARDSnet\u2019 or low tidal volume ventilation (LTV)\nSmall trials and animal studies have suggested that longer periods within the ventilation cycle at high pressure with intermittent release to low pressure, known as airway pressure release ventilation (APRV), may be beneficial by improving alveolar recruitment, gas exchange and reduced lung injury\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\nEthics approval in accordance with Helsinki Declaration with informed written consent\nTrial registered as \u201cBILEVEL-APRV\u201d a priori with no change in primary outcome:\u00a0NCT02639364\nRandomisation sequence generated by computer in block design\nConcealment of allocation by opaque envelopes\nSample population drawn from consecutive patients\nAllocation not blinded (\u201cOpen-label\u201d design)\nPower calculation based upon previously published data\n\nLTV 14.5 ventilator-free days\nExpected absolute difference with APRV +5 days\nPowered at 80%\nSignificance set at 0.05\n138 patients required, which includes allowance for drop-outs\n\n\nStatistical analysis using appropriate tests\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre study in Sichuan province, China\nMay 2015 \u2013 October 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nDiagnosis of ARDS according to the Berlin Criteria\nPaO2 : FiO2 < 250 mmHg (< 33.3 kPa)\nEndotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for < 48 hours\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nAnticipated mechanical ventilation < 48 hours\nNeuromuscular disorders that prolong mechanical ventilation need\nIntracranial hypertension (suspected or proven)\nSevere COPD\nTreatment with ECMO at enrollment\nRefractory shock\nKnown barotrauma\nAge <18 or > 85 years\nPregnancy\nLess than 6-month predicted life or lack of commitment to life support\n\n\n251 screened; 138 patients randomised; 138 in intention-to-treat analysis; 118 in the per-protocol analysis\nBaseline characteristics between groups, including reason for ARDS, were not significantly different except for the presence of coexisting disease (APRV vs LTV)\n\nAge: 51.5 vs 52.0 years\nAPACHE 2: 22.0 vs 20.2\nDiagnosis of cancer: 9.9% vs 17.9% (P = 0.22)\nAny coexisting disease: 32.4% vs 50.7% (P =\u00a00.04)\nPneumonia as cause of ARDS: 25.4% vs 38.8% (P =\u00a00.10)\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nAirway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV)\n\nInitiation: patients were transitioned from previous Volume Assist-Controlled Ventilation (VCV) to APRV\n\nPhigh was set to previous Pplat measured, and not exceeding 30 cmH2O\nPlow was set a 5 cmH2O\nTlow\u00a0(the duration at the lower pressure) was set at 1.0\u20131.5x expiratory time constant (TE)\n\nTE is the time required for 63% volume to be expelled\nTE = Resistance of the respiratory system (Rrs) x Static compliance (Cstat)\n\nRrs\u00a0and Cstat\u00a0are measured during an inspiratory pause\n\n\n~3x TE is the time required to expel full volume down to residual volume\nTlow was subsequently adjusted so that expiratory flow rate was 50% peak expiratory flow rate\n\n\nRelease frequency was set at 10\u201314 /min\nThigh was dependent upon Tlow and release frequency\nInitial spontaneous respiratory level was targeted as 30% of total minute ventilation\n\n\nWeaning: if cardiopulmonary function was stable and sedation was adequate, the ventilatory support was reduced twice daily\n\nPhigh was reduced by 2 cmH2O\nRelease frequency was reduced by 2 /min\n\n\nTermination: patients underwent a spontaneous breathing trial when:\n\nPhigh\u00a020 cmH2O or less\nFiO2\u00a040% or less\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of APRV.By Je.rrt (Own work)

Assist-Control Ventilation mode (VCV)\n\nTidal volume (VT) target was 6 ml/kg predicted body weight\nAcceptable range for VT was 4\u20138 ml/kg\nPEEP level was adjusted according to FiO2 using low-PEEP table from ARMA trial\n\nIf ARDS was severe (PaO2:FiO2 < 100 mmHg) then PEEP could be titrated according to optimal oxygenation, optimal compliance or clinician\u2019s discretion\n\n\nVentilation frequency was set to maintain target pH according to ARMA trial\n\n\nWeaning: PEEP and frequency were titrated down as oxygenation and ventilation improved as outlined above\n\nDaily sedation breaks occurred if Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale score was less than -2\n\n\nTermination: patients underwent a spontaneous breathing trial when:\n\nFiO2 40% or less\nPEEP 8 cmH2O or less\nPaO2 60 mmHg (8 kPa) or more\nAcceptable spontaneous breathing effort\nSystolic BP 90 mmHg or more with not more than\n\nDobutamine 5 \u00b5g/kg/min\nNoradrenaline 2 \u00b5g/kg/min\n\n\nNo neuro-muscular blocking drugs\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll patients were initially ventilated with volume assist-control ventilation (VCV) according to the LTV strategy using a Puritan Bennett 840 Ventilator from Covidien\nAdditional measures that could be used in severe hypoxia were:\n\nRecruitment manoeuvres\n\nLTV: incremental PEEP increase up to 40 cmH2O\nAPRV: Phigh and Plow increased incrementally until Phigh 40 cmH2O\n\n\nProne positioning\nNeuro-muscular blockade\nInhaled nitric oxide\n\n\nspontaneous breathing trials were:\n\n30 minutes\nPEEP 5 cmH2O\nPressure support ventilation 5\u20137 cmH2O\nFiO2 40%\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: the number of ventilator-free days up to day 28 was significantly greater in the APRV group compared to the LTV group\n\nMedian ventilator-free days:\n\nAPRV group: 19 [IQR 8\u201322]\nLTV group: 2 [IQR 0\u201315]\nP = < 0.001\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nAPRV resulted in significantly better markers of oxygenation and ventilation, such as better PaO2:FiO2 ratio, better lung compliance, lower Pplat and Ppeak\nAPRV resulted in significantly lower heart rate and higher blood pressure\nAPRV resulted in less sedation depth (i.e. more awake patients) with lower doses of opiates and benzodiazepines (propofol doses were similar)\nSuccessful extubation rates were higher in the APRV group, and fewer tracheostomies occurred\nICU length of stay was shorter in the APRV group\nMortality and hospital length of stay were similar between the groups\nRescue measures for severe hypoxia occurred more frequently in the LTV group\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nEarly application of APRV was associated with better oxygenation, less sedation, fewer days of mechanical ventilation and shorter ICU stays\n\nStrengths\n\nInteresting theory lacking substantial evidence so far\nReasonable hypothesis and appropriate methodology to test it\nRandomised, controlled trial minimises bias from confounding factors and provides best evidence from testing two interventions\nAppropriate randomisation process\nConsecutive sampling reduces selection bias \u2013 clinicians could not choose who to include in the trial as all patients were considered\nAdequate concealment using opaque envelopes, which minimises selection bias, but web-based system would have been better\nClear protocolised care reduces possible bias from open-label design \u2013 clinicians knew which group the patient was in but treatment was directed by objective protocols\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle centre conduct limits certainty about validity of results and prevents meaningful generalisation of those results \u2013 generally repeat studies with multi-centre designs find a small effect from the intervention\nImportant baseline difference exist (by chance) \u2013 the APRV group had less coexisting chronic disease, which may have added to the size of the observed effect\n\nMultiple linear regression analysis was conducted to statistically correct for this and the authors report the conclusion remained the same\n\n\nOpen-label design introduces possible allocation bias as treatment unrelated to the hypothesis can be different between groups due to clinician awareness of allocation \u2013 this tends to lead to exaggerated effect size\nThe intervention and control group protocols differed in numerous ways and not just the specific ventilator settings\n\nThis included high PEEP recruitment manoeuvres (such as those found to be harmful in the ART Trial), weaning strategies, thresholds for spontaneous breathing trials\nIt could be said that this trial compares a ventilation protocol that includes APRV vs a ventilation protocol that includes LTV\nMany centres no longer use LTV in the way this protocol specified, which may reduce the generalisability of the results\nWhilst this doesn\u2019t reduce the validity of the conclusion, it does imply that other centres should not expect to see improvement in patient outcomes from simply changing the ventilator mode\n\n\nRespiratory therapists implemented all ventilator associated therapies, which may not be standard practice in all Intensive Care Units\n\nThis reduces the generalisability of the results\nSuch large differences may not be observed if the same intervention is performed by Critical Care doctors and nurses rather than dedicated respiratory therapists\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe reported benefits of APRV are clinically significant and the conduct of the trial is reasonable enough to conclude the results are probably valid\nHowever, given the single centre design and the extensive use of respiratory therapists, I would like to see a multi-centre, multi-national trial before concluding APRV is far better than LTV\nFor now, I shall consider APRV in selected patients with severe ARDS\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Early application of airway
