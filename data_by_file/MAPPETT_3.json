NEJM 2002:347(15);1143-1150.\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with sub-massive PE, does the use of thrombolysis\u00a0+ heparin, compared to heparin alone, reduce the composite outcome of mortality or clinical deterioration?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial\nPowered at 80% to detect 13% absolute reduction from baseline incidence of 39%, with alpha level of 5%, if 434 patients are randomised\n\nSetting\n\n49 Centres in Germany\nSeptember 1997 \u2013 August 2001\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Patients with acute PE and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension\n\nPE diagnosed on V/Q, spiral CT or pulmonary angiography\nRV dysfunction defined by ECHO (31%) or ECG changes (complete or incomplete RBBB, S wave in lead I combined with Q waves in lead III, or inverted T waves in precordial leads V1, V2 and V3)\nPulmonary hypertension defined by ECHO or catheterisation of the right side of the heart\n\n\nExclusion: age >80, haemodynamic instability (BP<90), onset of symptoms >4 days previously, contraindication to thrombolysis\n256 patients randomised\n\nIntervention\n\n100mg alteplase\u00a0+ heparin\n\nAlteplase: 10mg bolus followed by 90mg infusion over 2 hours\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo and Heparin\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll patients had 5000 units heparin bolus, followed by infusion started at rate of 1000 units/hr, with target APTR 2-2.5\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: In-hospital death or clinical deterioration requiring escalation of treatment (need for catecholamines, rescue thrombolysis, intubation, CPR or emergency surgical embolectomy or thrombus fragmentation)\n\n11% in thrombolysis group vs. 24.6% in control, P=0.006, NNT 7.5\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nMortality\n\n3.4% vs. 2.2%, P=0.71\n\n\nEscalation of treatment\n\n10.2% vs. 24.6%, P=0.004, NNT 7.5\nThis was predominately due to secondary thrombolysis\n\n7.6% vs. 23.2%, P=0.001\n\n\n\n\nMajor bleeding (fatal bleed, intra-cranial haemorrhage, drop in Hb of 4g/dl)\n\n0.8% vs. 3.6%, P=0.29\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe addition of alteplase can improve the clinical course for patients with submassive PE and can prevent clinical deterioration\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised\nDouble-blinded\nClearly defined definitions of RV dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension\n\nWeaknesses\n\nComposite outcome that included a number of variables that were not patient-orientated outcomes. The decision to\u00a0give rescue thrombolysis appeared to be at the discretion of the blinded physician as oppose to strict criteria. Indications for rescue thrombolysis included dyspnoea\u00a0or persistent RV dysfunction. At the time of the study these were not standard indications for thrombolysis.\nUnder-powered. Trial was stopped early following an interim analysis which found a statistically significant improvement. Stopping at an interim analysis for a positive outcome will tend to exaggerate the effect size due to normal statistical variation\nConflicts of interest: Boehringer gave statistical advice\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThrombolysis for sub-massive PE decreased the requirement for rescue thrombolysis but did not affect mortality or adverse events. i.e giving thrombolysis early meant that you were less likely to need to give it later.\nFurther evidence is required before this treatment can be recommended.\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf\u00a0/\u00a0abstract\u00a0/ doi: 10.1056/NEJMMoa021274\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\nLife in the fast lane\nRAGE podcast\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@DavidSlessor\nSummary date: 25 June 2014\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n"
