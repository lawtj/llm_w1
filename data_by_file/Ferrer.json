Crit Care Med 2014; 38:367-374. doi:10.1097/CCM.0000000000000330\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, is the timing of first administration of antibiotics associated with the in-hospital mortality rate?\n\nDesign\n\nRetrospective observational cohort study\nUtilised data from voluntary Surviving Sepsis Campaign database\nAdequacy of screening, inclusion and data accuracy not checked\nGeneralized Estimating Equation (GEE) used for population-level average\n\nSetting\n\n165 intensive care units across Europe, United States and South America\nJanuary 2005 to February 2010\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: patients admitted to ICU with a suspected infection, two or more SIRS criteria and one or more organ dysfunction criteria (that is, severe sepsis or septic shock)\nExclusion: if antibiotics were not given (1.6%), if antibiotics had already been given (32%) or if it was unclear when they were given (3.0%).\n28,150 screened and 17,990 analysed after the above exclusions.\n\nIntervention\n\nTiming of antibiotics\n\nstratified into 0\u20131 hr, 1\u20132 hrs, 2\u20133 hrs, 3\u20134 hrs, 4\u20135 hrs, 5\u20136 hrs and > 6 hrs\nappropriateness of antibiotics, and the specific drug and dosage were not analysed\n\n\n\nControlled factors\n\nAuthors tested the impact of 51 covariates in the model. Classified as:\n\nconfounder if it was associated with >10% change in odds ratio\neffect modifier if this was statistically significant with p<0.05\n\n\n\nOutcome\nIn words\n\nRaw data: Hospital mortality was lowest in the cohort given antibiotics between hours 1 and 2 and increased significantly beyond this time frame (that is, a \u2018J-shaped\u2019 distribution was observed)\nAdjusted GEE population averaged logistic regression model:\n\nThree covariates identified as confounders (statistical significance not reported)\n\nSepsis severity score (an unpublished but validated score based on the Surviving Sepsis Campaign database)\nClinical location (Emergency department, in-patient hospital ward, or already in ICU)\nGeographical location (Europe, United States, or South America)\n\n\nHospital mortality was lowest in the cohort given antibiotics before 1 hour and increase for each hour of delay.\nWhen compared sequentially, with the \u2018< 1hr\u2019 cohort as the baseline, the p value becomes <0.05 at 2\u20133 hours. That is, there is significant possibility that the observed difference in outcome between <1 hr and 1\u20132 hrs may be due to chance alone.\n\n\n\n\nIn numbers\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdjusted hospital mortality\n\n\nTime\nOR\np\nMortality\n95% CI\nNNH\n\n\n\n\n<1\n1.00\n\u2013\n24.6%\n23.2\u201326.0\n\u2013\n\n\n1\u20132\n1.07\n0.165\n25.9%\n24.5\u201327.2\n73\n\n\n2\u20133\n1.14\n0.021\n27.0%\n25.3\u201328.7\n35\n\n\n3\u20134\n1.19\n0.009\n27.9%\n25.6\u201330.1\n25\n\n\n4\u20135\n1.24\n0.006\n28.8%\n25.9\u201331.7\n19\n\n\n5\u20136\n1.47\n<0.001\n32.3%\n28.5\u201336.2\n8\n\n\n>6\n1.52\n<0.001\n33.1%\n30.9\u201335.3\n7\n\n\n\n\nBaseline is taken as \u2018<1\u2019 cohort.

Although it is commendable that they sought to provide evidence for the guidelines, they may have cognitive biases in favour of finding an association. Could this be repeated by a different, unassociated research group?\nAs highlighted in previous SSC publications (see Levy and Dellinger link below), the quality, accuracy and completeness of the dataset was not verified\nInherently, other unanticipated confounding factors may exist\nZero time was the point of identification and diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock. Patients may have already developed severe sepsis or septic shock some time before this but then went undiagnosed. Therefore \u2018zero time\u2019 has subjectivity. This is a weakness of all similar studies and will be difficult to overcome. It is unlikely to reduce the validity of the conclusion though.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis larger and broader observational study addresses a question that cannot ethically be answered by a randomised, controlled trial.\nIt provides strong evidence that the time between diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock and the first dose of antibiotics is critical.\nWhether there exists a difference between 0\u20131 hour and 1\u20132 hours could be debated, but greater than 2 hours is almost certainly associated with a higher rate of hospital mortality.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Article abstract]\u00a0Empiric Antibiotic Treatment Reduces Mortality in Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock From the First Hour: Results From a Guideline-Based Performance Improvement Program by Ferrer et al.\n[Editorial] The Golden Hour of Antibiotic Administration in Severe Sepsis: Avoid a False Start Striving for Gold by van Zanten.\n[Further reading]\u00a0The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: results of an international guideline-based performance improvement program targeting severe sepsis by Levy and Dellinger et al.\n[Further reading] Duration of hypotension before initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy is the critical determinant of survival in human septic shock by Kumar.\n[Further reading] Antibiotic Timing by LITFL.\n[Further reading]\u00a0Statistical Analysis of Correlated Data Using Generalized Estimating Equations: An Orientation by Hanley et al.\n\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 1 August 2014\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@stevemathieu75\n\n\n"
