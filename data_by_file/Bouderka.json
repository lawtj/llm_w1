J Trauma: Injury, Infection & Critical Care 2004;57(2): 251-254. doi: 10.1097/01.TA.0000087646.68382.9A\nClinical Question\n\nDoes early tracheostomy reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality in comparison with prolonged intubation in patients with head injury?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised Controlled Trial\nNon-blinded\nWith estimated reduction in duration of ventilation from intervention of 25%, alpha of 0.05, 34 patients would give the study 80% power\n\nSetting\n\nSingle ICU, Morocco\n\nPopulation\n\nIsolated severe head injury, with admission GCS <9, and GCS <8 without sedation on day 5\n62 patients randomised\n\nIntervention\n\nEarly tracheostomy (Day 5/6) performed by critical care physician\n\nControl\n\nProlonged endotracheal intubation\n\nOutcome\n\nComparing early tracheostomy vs. prolonged endotracheal intubation\n\nPrimary outcome: length of mechanical ventilation (days)\n\n14.5 \u00b17.3 vs. 17.5 \u00b110.6, P=0.02\n\n\nSecondary Outcomes\n\nMortality: 38.7% vs. 22.5%, P=0.27\nNosocomial pneumonia: 58% vs. 61.3%, P=0.79\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusion\n\nEarly tracheostomy decreased the length of mechanical ventilation but not mortality\n\nStrengths\n\nAppropriate inclusion criteria with homogenous population\nRandomised\nAppropriate power calculation\n\nWeaknesses\n\n150 patients with severe head injury had been admitted to the ICU but only 62 randomised.\u00a0Only reported exclusion criteria for 6 patients.\nNon-blinded. (Impractical to blind treating clinicians but could have blinded staff analysing the data)\nThe statistics for the primary outcome are questionable. With only a small number of patients, a small difference found between treatment groups and a large range for the duration of ventilation, a P value of 0.02 is questionable. The author of the study was contacted for further information so that we could verify the statistics. Unfortunately this was not possible as the original data has now been lost.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis small study found no convincing benefit from early tracheostomy when compared to prolonged endotracheal ventilation in patients with severe head injury. Further larger studies are required.\nCritical appraisal of trials is paramount \u2013 don\u2019t just read the abstract and conclusions of trials!\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0Early tracheostomy versus Prolonged Endotracheal Intubation in Severe Head Injury by Bouderka.\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: David Slessor\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date: 1 May 2014\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n\n"
