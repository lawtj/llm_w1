Lancet Respiratory Medicine. 2020;8(3)267-276\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with moderate-severe ARDS, does dexamethasone in addition to routine care, compared with routine care alone increase ventilator free days up to day 28?\n\nBackground\n\nARDS is an acute diffuse, inflammatory lung injury, in response to acute pulmonary and systemic insults\nThere are no proven pharmacological therapies for ARDS\nThere is interest in the potential use of steroids for ARDS due to their anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties\nDifferent regimens of corticosteroids have been tested in ARDS with inconclusive results\nA meta-analysis of 9 trials (n=816) reported that steroids for ARDS reduced time to extubation and mortality\nA Cochrane review of 17 RCTs (n=2264) reported that steroids for severe pneumonia reduced mortality\nTrials published following the publication of this trial have demonstrated a reduced mortality in patients with COVID-19 who are treated with steroids\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n\nBalanced treatment assignments, stratified by centres in blocks of ten\nUse of opaque sealed envelopes to ensure allocation concealment\nComputer generated random number table\n\n\nTreating clinicians were not blinded to study group\nOutcome assessors were masked to study group\nIntention to treat analysis\nSample size of 314 patients gave 80% power with 5% false positive rate to detect a reduction from 9 to 7 ventilator free days, and 15% reduction in 60 day mortality from baseline of 48%\nTrial stopped early following recommendation of data and safety monitoring board due to low enrolment numbers\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\n\nSetting\n\n17 intensive care units in teaching hospitals in Spain\nData collected March 2013 \u2013 December 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAge \u226518\nIntubated and mechanically ventilated\nAcute onset of ARDS as defined by\n\nAmerican-European Consensus Conference criteria for ARDS or by the Berlin Criteria as moderate-severe ARDS\n\nwithin 1 week of initiating clinical condition (e.g. pneumonia, aspiration, inhalation injury, sepsis, trauma, pancreatitis)\nnew/worsening respiratory symptoms\nbilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest xray or CT\nno clinical signs of left heart failure or absence of left atrial hypertension;

This meant that the intervention was limited to patients who would have been likely to benefit from this treatment\n\nWeaknesses\n\nLow level of proning, and no mandated protocol for its use\nSet in single country may limit external validity\nEach site only recruited average 3 patients per year, potential for selection bias\nTrial stoped early due to low recruitment\nTreating clinicians non-blinded\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with early but established moderate-severe ARDS the use of dexamethasone in addition to standard care, significantly increased the number of ventilator free days and significantly reduced mortality\nThe majority of patients were not proned. It is therefore unclear if the benefit remains in patients who are treated with proning\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Dexamethasone treatment for the acute respiratory distress syndrome: a multicentre, randomised controlled trial\n[further reading]\u00a0PulmCrit \u2013 Steroid for ARDS?
