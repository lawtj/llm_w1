Lancet 2023; Jan 25;S0140-6736(22)02469-2. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(22)02469-2.\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients, does a higher dose of protein compared to usual dose protein, improve time-to-discharge-alive from hospital up to 60 days?\n\nBackground\n\nCritical illness is associated with loss of muscle mass, and the degree of sarcopenia is correlated to clinical outcomes\nAnimal studies and physiological principles indicate that protein could be the most clinically important substrate to maintain muscle mass and improve clinical outcomes, and labelled isotope scans in humans have suggested that exogenous amino acids may stimulate an anabolic response\nHowever, observational studies comparing lower and higher dose protein doses have conflicting results and randomised controlled data is sparse and limited by insufficient separation between groups\u00a0\nThis uncertainty is reflected in international nutrition guidelines, which vary in their recommendations and in registry data, which demonstrates considerable variety in nutrition practices around the world\n\nDesign\n\nSingle-blinded, multi-centre, randomised trial\u00a0\nCentral randomisation through a computer-generated schedule that allocated patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive either high-dose or usual dose protein through permuted blocks of 2, 4 or 8\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, recruitment stalled and the original primary outcome (60-day mortality) was amended in June 2021\nThe blinded data set was accessed at this time to determine pooled event rates, from which estimations of 60-day mortality and median time-to-discharge-alive from hospital were made\nUsing these assumptions, the investigators estimated that a sample size of 600 patients per group would achieve 83% power at a two-sided \u03b1 of 0\u00b705 for a relative risk reduction in hospital mortality of 15% (from 34\u00b76% to 29\u00b75%), combined with a 20% increase in the hazard rate of time-to-discharge-alive among hospital survivors\nModified intention-to-treat analysis\nRegistered at ClinicalTrials.gov and monitored by an independent DSMB\n\nSetting\n\n1329 patients recruited in 85 ICUs across 16 countries between January 2018 and December 2021\n28 did not receive the assigned intervention and were excluded from the analysis, according to the pre-specified modified intention to treat design\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adults within 96 hours of ICU admission who were expected to remain mechanically ventilated for at least 48 hours, with \u22651 nutritional risk factor:\n\nLow (\u226425 kg/m2) or high (\u226535 kg/m2) BMI\nModerate to severe malnutrition, as defined by local assessments\nFrailty (CFS \u22655)\nSarcopenia (SARC-F \u22654)\n\n\nExclusions:\n\n>96 hours of mechanical ventilation prior to screening\nExpected to die or undergo withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments\nPregnancy\nWhere the responsible clinician felt that the patient needed either low or high protein\u00a0\nRequirement for PN where the recruiting site did not have products to achieve high protein dose targets\n\n\nBaseline demographics (high-dose vs normal dose protein):\n\nAge: 57 vs 57 years\nMale sex: 61% vs 59%\nMedical admission: 85% vs 82%\nVasopressor: 39% vs 41%\nAPACHE-II: 21 vs 21\nPrimary diagnosis:\n\nRespiratory: 43% vs 42%\nNeurological: 16% vs 14%\nSepsis: 13% vs 14%\nTrauma: 9% vs 10%\nBurns: <1% vs <1%\n\n\nBMI: 28 vs 28.6 kg/m2\nClinical Frailty Score: 3 vs 3\nSARC-F: 1 vs 1\nUnintentional weight loss prior to admission: 15% vs 15%\nChronic malabsorption prior to admission: 2% vs 2%\nModerate or severe fat or muscle wasting prior to admission: 18% vs 17%\nAKI at randomisation: 25% vs 23%\nRRT at randomisation: 12% vs 9%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nHigh protein dose\n\n2.2 g/kg per day or more, of protein prescribed\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard protein dose\n\n1.2 g/kg per day or less, of protein prescribed\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nInterventions carried out for up to 28 days (or until death, or transition to full oral feeding if either occurred prior to 28 days)\nClinicians encouraged to achieve at least 80% of the protein prescription, which could be achieved through any combination of enteral or parenteral nutrition\u00a0\u00a0\nClinicians were otherwise encouraged to follow published international guidelines and to avoid over-feeding\nIdeal body weight was used for patients with a BMI>30 kg/m2\nTotal energy dose was not controlled\n\nOutcome\n\nAdherence to study protocol: (high-dose vs normal dose protein)\n\nTime from ICU admit to starting EN: 16.0 vs 16.1 hours\nType of nutrition:\n\nEN only: 92.6% vs 91.3%\nPN only: 0.5% vs 2%\nEN + PN: 7.0% vs 6.7%\n\n\nDaily protein received: 1.6 vs 0.9 g/kg/day\nDaily energy received: 14.7 vs 13.2 kcal/kg/day\nPatients receiving >110% prescribed energy: 1.6% vs 2.4%\n\n\nPrimary efficacy endpoint: Incidence of alive hospital discharge by 60 days was not statistically different between groups\u00a0\n\n46.1% vs 50.2% (RR 0.91;

The authors speculate, however, that this would be more likely to bias to the intervention arm given prevailing attitudes around high-protein feeding, and this was a negative study\nThe study protocol and primary outcome were amended due to slow recruitment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was underpowered for the original primary outcome of 60-day mortality\nCertain subgroups of interest were under-represented in this study including trauma, surgery and burns\nProtein delivery was the same throughout the study period, and was not adapted for the theoretical stages of critical illness. The hypothesis that patients in later (and potentially anabolic) stages of critical illness may benefit from higher doses of protein was not tested\nThe finding that patients with AKI or high acute physiology scores who receive high protein-dose nutrition have poorer outcomes is from subgroup analysis, and should be considered hypothesis generating\nMortality, even as a secondary endpoint, may be considered problematic for nutrition trials, and there was no data collected regarding functional outcomes or quality of life in survivors. The hypothesis that high-dose protein may improve the experience of survivorship was not tested\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWell designed and executed pragmatic study with high internal and external validity, which reassures me that high-protein delivery for all-comers to ICU with at least one nutritional risk factor is not warranted, and may in fact worsen outcomes in sicker patients or those with AKI\u00a0\nFuture studies may focus on sub-groups that are hypothesised to benefit from high-dose protein such as obesity or trauma, patients in later stages of critical illness, or focus on functional outcomes\nThe results support current ESPEN recommendations that 1.3g/kg/day protein can be delivered progressively in critical illness\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle The effect of higher protein dosing in critically ill patients with high nutritional risk (EFFORT Protein): an international, multicentre, pragmatic, registry-based randomised trial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Andrew Achilleos\nSummary date: 9th February 2023\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\nPicture by: Niklas on Unsplash\n\n\n"
