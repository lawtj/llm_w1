Thorax 2017; 72:600-609. doi:10.1136/thoraxjnl-2016-209576\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients that survive critical illness, does a post-discharge exercise programme compared to standard post-discharge care improve physical function?\n\nBackground\n\nSurvivors of critical illness often will suffer from reduced physical function, exercise capacity, health related quality of life and increased healthcare utilisation, which may continue for up to 5 years following discharge from hospital\nThere are very few studies exploring rehabilitation programmes following hospital discharge for patients requiring intensive care\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, randomised, controlled trial\nAllocation concealed by centralised online system and variable permuted blocks\nAssessors were blinded to allocation and patients were instructed not to reveal\nIn the absence of prior data, the Cohen method was used to estimate that 52 patients were required (Postulated \u201cmedium effect\u201d with Cohen\u2019s\u00a0d\u00a0= 0.5)\n\nThis is an alternative to a precise power calculation\nSample size was increased to 68 to allow for drop-out of 25%\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nSix Intensive Care Units in Northern Ireland\nDecember 2011 to December 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: 18 years or older; mechanically ventilated for > 96 hours\nExclusion: planned to be discharged home; medically fit to participate; not engaged in other rehabilitation programme\n1118 screened (293 died, 765 excluded), 60 patients were randomised, 55 patients were analysed at primary end-point\nBaseline demographics (Exercise group vs Standard care group)\n\nMean age: 51 vs 51\nGender: 43% male vs 70% male\nPrimary respiratory diagnosis: 57% vs 43%\nMean APACHE 2: 17 vs 15\n\n\nSeveral baseline measurements for secondary outcomes were significantly worse in Exercise group compared to Standard care group\n\nIntervention\n\n6-week post-discharge individualised exercise programme\n\nPatients received all standard care in addition to the exercise programme\nPhysiotherapists underwent standardised training and were given a comprehensive intervention pack with exercise instructions and suggestions for modifications\n6-week programme (could be delivered over 10 weeks to allow for non-attendance)\n\nTwice weekly supervised session at hospital gym (or patient\u2019s home if required)\nOnce weekly unsupervised session at patient\u2019s home\n\n\nEach session was up to one hour and included\n\nWarm up\nCircuits of arm, leg and whole-body conditioning and strengthening exercises\nAerobic exercise such as walking or cycling for 10 to 30 minutes\nCool down and relaxation\n\n\nAlthough intended to be a group session, the recruitment rate and geography meant that patients received this therapy individually\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard post-discharge care\n\nNothing above the local post-discharge care provided by each hospital\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: No statistically significant difference was demonstrated in the improvement from baseline of the physical functioning component of the SF-36 Health Survey at 6-weeks (end of exercise programme), although the point estimate was equal to the clinically meaningful difference previously defined\n\nSF-36 Physical Function mean change in score\n\nExercise group: +6.8 (SD 10.9)\nStandard care group: +3.9 (SD 8.2)\nDifference of mean change from baseline: 3.0 (95% CI -2.2 to 8.2; P = 0.26)\nThis was not sustained when measured at 6 months\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome: Many of the secondary outcomes measured at 6-weeks demonstrated a statistically significant difference in favour of the exercise group (expressed as between group difference in the mean change from baseline)\n\nSF-36 Role Physical: 6.6 (95% CI 0.73 to 12.5; P = 0.03)\nIncremental Shuttle Walk Test: 83.1m (95% CI 8.3 to 157.9; P = 0.03)\nFunctional Limitation Profile: -4.8 (95% CI -8.7 to -0.9; P = 0.02)\nChronic disease self-efficacy scale: 2.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 3.7; P = 0.01)\nReadiness to exercise: 1.3 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.9; P < 0.001)\nOther secondary outcomes at 6-weeks were not statistically significant\nAll but \u2018readiness to exercise\u2019 were not sustained at medium-term follow-up (6 months)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAfter discharge from hospital following critical illness, a 6 week individualised exercise programme did not improve self-reported physical fitness at 6 weeks or 6 months, although encouraging results \u00a0in secondary outcomes should be used for further studies on this theory\n\nStrengths\n\nRehabilitation after critical illness is an important topic to research\nWell designed multi-centre trial across a regional research unit\nGood inclusion of patients at the more severe end of critical illness spectrum, in whom an intervention like this is most likely to be effective\nAnticipated high drop-out rate and reasonable effort to estimate necessary sample size\nAppropriate efforts to maintain concealment of allocation and blinding where possible, which will reduce systematic bias\nWell established patient-centred primary outcome that investigates how the patient feels rather than what we measure\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDespite appropriate randomisation, there were imbalances in the baseline demographic and measured variables between the groups\n\nThe bias of this is uncertain as the outcome variables were differences in the individual paired before-after measurements\nAn Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for these differences but this did not change the conclusion\n\n\nOnly 7.8% of screened patients were recruited, due to death or exclusion criteria, which may reduce the generalisability\nA cost-analysis would have been useful, as an intervention like this will be demanding on resources\nAs the point estimate and 95% CIs of the primary outcome overlapped the pre-specified clinically meaningful value (+3 score change from baseline, on a 0-100 scale), this trial does not rule out that this intervention is useful, but a much larger trial will be needed to draw a stronger conclusion (i.e. risk of type 2 error if we accept the null hypothesis)\nThis trial only investigated one form of physical rehabilitation \u2013 it isn\u2019t clear from this trial alone if the theory (rehabilitation after critical illness is good for patients) is wrong or if the specific intervention (thrice weekly individualised 1-hour exercise session) is ineffective\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe research group should be commended for investigating this important but complex aspect of critical illness\nNo clear benefit was demonstrated when patients at the sicker end of the critical illness spectrum were given a 6-week individualised exercise programme after hospital discharge\nAny possible benefit appears lost by 6 months\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effectiveness of an exercise programme on physical function in patients discharged from hospital following critical illness (the REVIVE trial)\n[further reading]\u00a0NICE CG83: Rehabilitation after Critical Illness\n[further reading]\u00a0Reading ICU Support Network: Rehabilitation and Follow-up after Critical Illness\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Duncan Chambler\nSummary date: 21 June 2017\nPeer-review editor: Steve Mathieu\n\n\n"
