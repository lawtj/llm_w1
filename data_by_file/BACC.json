DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2028836\nClinical Question\n\nIn hospitalised patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome due to coronavirus 2 (SAR-CoV-2), does tocilizumab compared with placebo, reduce intubation rates or mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nIn December 2019 the Wuhan province in China became the epicentre of a devastating, highly contagious viral infection, SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 illness\nBy March 2020, the World Health Organisation announced they were deeply concerned by the alarming levels of spread and severity of the disease and characterised COVID-19 as a pandemic\nTo date, there are more than 74 million confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide and 1.6 million deaths\nThere have been many trials conducted on patients with COVID-19, with the hope to find effective therapeutic options. To date, the treatments that have shown effectiveness are Dexamethasone, which reduces 28-day mortality and Remdesivir, which may reduce hospital length of stay.\nEarly observation in Chinese patients showed an association between high circulating levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and progression to death and mechanical ventilation. Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor blocker\nA retrospective, observational trial, STOP-COVID suggested a benefit to using tocilizumab, HR 0.71 for time to death. Several RCTs have not demonstrated a mortality benefit in patients receiving tocilizumab (EMPACTA, COVACTA, CORIMUNO-TOCI-1, RCT-TCZ-COVID-19)\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n2:1 randomisation to tocilizumab or placebo\nDouble-blinded\nRandom block size of 3 or 6\nStratification by site\nInformed consent was obtained\nWith 243 patients the trial had a power of 80% to detect a reduction of death or the need for invasive mechanical ventilation from 30% to 15%\nModified intention to treat analysis \u2013 included all patients that were randomised and received either tocilizumab or placebo before intubation or death\n\nSetting\n\n7 hospitals in Boston, MA, USA (Investigator initiated Boston Area COVID-19 Consortium: BACC)\nThe trial was funded by Genetech, who provided tocilizumab but had no role in the design or data analysis\nPatients were enrolled between April 20 and June 15 2020: total number enrolled was 243 (161 received tocilizumab and 81 placebo)\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Age 19-85 AND confirmed SARS-CoV-2 AND 2 of: fever (>38C), pulmonary infiltrate, need for supplemental O2 to keep SaO2>92% AND 1 of CRP>50mg/L, Ferritin >500ng/ml, d-dimer>1000ng/ml or LDH > 250u/L\nExclusion: supplemental O2 >10L/min, recent treatment with biologic agents or immunosuppressive therapy, diverticulitis\nPatients were well matched at baseline, except age > 65 years\n\nComparing tocilizumab vs placebo groups\n\nAge >65 years: 37% vs. 27%\nNursed in non-intensive care ward and\n\nnot on oxygen: 14% vs. 18%\non oxygen: 83% vs. 74%\n\n\nReceiving non-invasive ventilation of highflow oxygen: 3% vs. 6%\nMechanically ventilated: 0% vs. 1%\nReceived glucocorticoids: 11% vs. 6%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nTocilizumab\n\nA single dose of tocilizumab, 8mg/kg (not exceeding 800mg) and usual care\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nThe trial was conducted after release of ACTT-1 trial, so some patients received remdesivir\nThe trial was conducted before the release of RECOVERY-dexamethasone, so no patients received dexamethasone\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Hazard Ratio for intubation or death (time to event analysis) \u2013 no significant difference\n\nTocilizumab vs Placebo: HR 0.83 (95%CI 0.38-1.81) p=0.64\n\nRates of intubation or death by day 28: 10.6% vs. 12.5%\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nComparing tocilizumab vs. placebo \u2013 no significant differences in\n\nClinical worsening at day 28\n\nHR 1.11 (95%CI 0.59-2.10) p=0.73\n\n\nClinical improvement at Day 28 with discontinuation of supplemental O2\n\nHR 0.94 (95%CI 0.67-1.3) p=0.69\n\n\nMortality at day 28\n\n5.6% vs. 3.8%, HR 1.52 (95% C.I. 0.41-5.61)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafety:\n\nNeutopenia more common in the Tocilizumab group (13.7% vs 1.2%)\nSerious secondary infection more common in the placebo group (8.1% vs 17.1%)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we did not find any efficacy of IL-6 receptor blockade for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomized, double-blinded\nAllocation concealment\nComplete follow-up\nEthnic diversity improves external validity\n\nWeaknesses\n\nModified intention to treat analysis (although only 1 patient didn\u2019t get analysed in the group they were allocated to and were included in the safety data\nA small study that does not exclude benefit in all subgroups of patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory syndrome, eg severe COVID-19 pneumonitis\nThe primary event rate was much lower than the anticipated 30%. Despite this, there was still no signal to benefit for tocilizumab\nThe patients were not an ICU cohort at randomisation\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe results of this small randomised trial are consistent with results of other small randomised trials of tocilizumab in patients with acute respiratory failure from SARS-CoV-2, that is, there is no benefit demonstrated\nHowever, the patients in this trial were only moderately unwell and the wide confidence intervals do not exclude a treatment benefit in some patient groups, eg those with severe COVID-19 pneumonitis\nI hold my judgement at this stage as to whether this trial\u2019s results can be applied to ICU patients with severe COVID-19\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Efficacy of Tocilizumab in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19\n[further reading]\u00a0BMJ: Covid-19: Critically ill patients treated with arthritis drug tocilizumab show improved outcomes, researchers report\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford @celiabradford\nSummary date: December 16 2020\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\nImage by Elliot Alderson from Pixabay\n\n\n"
