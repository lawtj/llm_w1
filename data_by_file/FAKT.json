clinical trial\nFerguson I Academic Emergency Medicine, 2021; DOI: 10.1111/acem.14446\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients requiring rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in the emergency department does the addition of fentanyl to ketamine and rocuronium reduce the frequency of patients having a systolic blood pressure (SBP) outside of a target range of 100-150mmHg?\n\nBackground\n\nThe INTUBE study showed high rates (42%) of cardiovascular instability in patients undergoing tracheal intubation in ICU, ED and the wards\nKetamine has become a commonly used drug for RSI in both pre-hospital and emergency department settings, due to its\u2019 perceived preferable haemodynamic profile\nFentanyl may prevent the pressor response to laryngoscopy and prevent episodes of hypertension which may be harmful in some patient groups\nIt is unclear whether the use of Fentanyl as a co-induction agent increases the risk of hypotension when compared with placebo\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, double blind placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial\nRandomised 1:1 to treatment or intervention\nActive and placebo drug prepared by Baxter pharmaceutical and then labelled with study ID by unblinded pharmacist\nBlinding maintained until manuscript written\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nObservations were recorded every 2 minutes by a nominated member of the clinical team for 10 minutes\nType of laryngoscope, airway grade, use of adjuncts, number of attempts and immediate complications (e.g. oesophageal intubation) were recorded contemporaneously\nStudy powered to detect a 20% decrease in the primary outcome (Systolic BP outside of the range 100-150) or a change of \u2265 10% if the (SBP) was already outside of this range at baseline\n\nIf SBP \u2265 151 mmHg then primary outcome met if postinduction SBP rose by \u2265 10% or fell outside the lower limit (i.e. 100 mmHg)\nIf SBP \u2264 99 mmHg then primary outcome met if postinduction SBP fell by \u2265 10% or rose above the upper limit (i.e. 150 mmHg)\n\n\nEthical approval gained and registered with Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry\n\nSetting\n\n5 ED in New South Wales, Australia, mixture of tertiary and

Conclusions\n\nIn a mixed population of adults requiring RSI in the ED the addition of fentanyl to rocuronium and ED did not reduce the incidence of an SBP outside of a target range on 100-150\nHowever there was an increased incidence of hypotension and reduced incidence of hypertension in the fentanyl group. Clinicians should consider postinduction haemodynamic targets before the decision to use fentanyl as a co-induction agent with ketamine\n\nStrengths\n\nWell-designed double-blinded study performed in the emergency setting\nPrimary outcome data available for 96% of those randomised\n\nSensitivity analyses reveal no change in primary outcome if the missing data was imputed as either meeting or not meeting the primary outcome\n\n\nIncluded hospitals of different sizes\nStandardised pre-intubation optimisation\nGood separation between groups in a manner that is biologically plausible\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNon-patient centred outcome that was designed by the study authors\n\nThe authors allude to a lack of a consistent approach in the literature around a pragmatic primary outcome\n\n\nThe long term clinical significance of transient haemodynamic changes is not clear\nFixed ratio of fentanyl to ketamine may not reflect clinician\u2019s practice\nAdditional sedation discouraged in the 10 minutes post induction \u2013 this may not be reflective of treating post-operative hypertension with further sedation doses\nLarge number of patients excluded due to clinician preference for alternate induction regimen which may suggest lack of equipoise\nInability to regularly recruit overnight may introduce a selection bias\nHospitals all from one region which may limit generalisability\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFentanyl, when given in a fixed ratio with ketamine, may increase the risk of peri-intubation hypotension\nI will continue to individually select the doses of induction agents based on patient characteristics and the co-induction agent used\n\nExternal Links\n\nArticle: Fentanyl versus placebo with ketamine and rocuronium for patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation in the emergency department: The FAKT study\u2014A randomized clinical trial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Alastair Brown \u2013 @alastairbrown21\nSummary date: 15th May 2022\nPeer-review editor: George Walker\nPicture by: Pexels / Karoline Grabowska\n\n\n"
