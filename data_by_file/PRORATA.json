Lancet 2010; 375:463-74. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61879-1\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients with suspected bacterial infections, does procalcitonin-guided antibiotic care compared to usual care reduce patient exposure to antibiotics without increasing mortality?\n\nDesign\n\nProspective, parallel group, open-label, randomised, controlled trial\nCentralised, computer-generated randomisation sequence with adequate masking\nStratified by centre in blocks of 2, 4 or 6\nInvestigators were unaware of aggregate outcome during trial period but were not blinded to individual patient allocation (i.e. open-label)\nPrimary endpoint objective and not patient reported to limit bias from open-label design\nClassification of infective episodes included clinical, radiographic and microbiological information, and were adjudicated by 4 expert clinicians who remained blinded to allocation\nIntention-to-treat analysis with worst-case imputation for missing data\nDesigned as superiority trial in terms of antibiotic use\n\nWith 266 patients, it was powered to detect a 3 day reduction in antibiotic use, assuming mean of 12 days in control group, with 90% power and two-sided \u03b1=0.05 testing\n\n\nAlso designed as a non-inferiority trial in terms of death\n\nWith 300 patients, it was powered to exclude a 10% non-inferiority margin, assuming a 35% mortality in control group, with 80% power and\u00a0\u03b1=0.10\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n8 intensive care units across France\n\n5 medical units vs 2 surgical units vs 1 mixed unit\nWithin 5 teaching hospitals and 1 general hospital\n\n\nJune 2007 to May 2008\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adults with suspected bacterial infections at admission or during their stay in intensive care who had:\n\nNot received antibiotics before inclusion\nOr had received antibiotics for less than 24 hours but were within 12 hours of admission\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nUnder 18 years of age\nPregnancy\nAnticipated less than 3 days admission to intensive care\nBone-marrow transplant or chemotherapy\nIndications for long-term antibiotics (e.g. infective endocarditis)\nPoor chance of survival (i.e. SAPS 2 > 65 points) or existing do-not-resuscitate order\n\n\n1315 patients assessed, 630 enrolled, 621 included in analysis (1.4% lost / withdrawn)\n\nIntervention\n\nProcalcitonin-based protocolised antibiotic care\n\nStarting antibiotics\n\nAccording to baseline serum procalcitonin level\n\n< 0.25 \u00b5g/l \u2192 antibiotics strongly discouraged\n\u2265 0.25 and < 0.5 \u00b5g/l \u2192 antibiotics discouraged\n\u2265 0.5 and < 1.0 \u00b5g/l \u2192 antibiotics encouraged\n\u2265 1.0 \u00b5g/l \u2192 antibiotics strongly encouraged\n\n\nRepeated 6\u201312 hours later if antibiotics not started to detect late peak\n\n\nStopping antibiotics\n\nAccording to serial serum procalcitonin level protocol\n\n\n\n< 0.25 \u00b5g/l \u2192 stopping antibiotics strongly encouraged\n\u2265 0.25 and < 0.5 \u00b5g/l or \u2265\u00a080% decrease from peak \u2192 stopping antibiotics encouraged\n\u2265 0.5\u00a0\u00b5g/l and < 80% decrease from peak \u2192 continuing antibiotics encouraged\n\u2265 0.5 \u00b5g/l and increase from peak\u2192 changing antibiotics strongly encouraged\n\n\n\n\n\nSerum sampling was performed:\n\nAt inclusion\nAt each infectious episode until day 28\nAt each morning if receiving antibiotics\nUsing Brahms\u2019 Krypton procalcitonin assay (minimum detection 0.06\u00a0\u00b5g/l with imprecision of 6\u201310%)\nAnd reported back to clinicians within 2 hours\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nClinician decision antibiotic care\n\nInternational and local antibiotic guidelines provided as a reminder and gold-standard\nClinicians decided optimum antibiotic management including duration\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nDrug selection was at the discretion of clinicians\nClinicians were encouraged to start antibiotics as soon as possible in severe infections\nDe-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics as soon as relevant information was available\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nSuperiority\n\nThe absolute difference in antibiotic exposure was 2.7 days (23% less) favouring the procalcitonin group\n95% CI 1.4 to 4.1 days\np-value <0.0001\n\n\nNon-inferiority\n\nThe absolute difference in mortality at 28-days was 0.8% and at 60-days was 3.8% favouring the control group\n90% CI limits did not cross the pre-specified 10% non-inferiority margin\n\nDeath at 28-days: 90% CI -4.6 to 6.2%\nDeath at 60-days: 90% CI -2.1 to 9.7%\n\n\nHazard ratio of death by 60-days was 0.96 (90% CI 0.84\u20131.09)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nNo statistically significant differences were identified for most of the secondary outcomes (see table for details)\n\nRelapse or superinfection\nDays without mechanical ventilation\nLength of stay in ICU\nLength of stay in hospital\nEmergence of multi drug-resistant bacteria\n\n\nStatistically significant differences were identified for the following, favouring the procalcitonin group\n\nDays of exposure to each antibiotic per 1000 inpatient days\nDuration of antibiotic treatment according to infection site\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nProcalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy reduced antibiotic exposure by 23% and is non-inferior to standard care regarding mortality outcomes\n\nStrengths\n\nDesign \u2013 the combination of superiority and non-inferiority allowed two important outcomes to be investigated appropriately\nInternal validity \u2013 the appropriate intention-to-treat analysis, minimal loss / withdrawal and worst-case imputation all increase the validity of the results and reduce the chance of a false positive outcome (at the cost of increased chance of false negative outcome)\nExternal validity \u2013 the multi-centre design and inclusion of many pathologies increases the generalisability to wider populations\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNon-inferiority design \u2013 a 10% non-inferiority margin is in line with existing antibiotic trials and guidance, but it could be debated as too extreme to conclude \u2018clinical non-inferiority\u2019.\nInternal validity \u2013 in a high proportion of cases clinicians overruled the procalcitonin protocol suggesting it provides useful advice but not rules for antibiotic use; consequently, outside trials the benefits of procalcitonin may not be as strong\nExternal validity \u2013 only 10% were surgical patients, reducing validity in this population; neutropenic patients and those receiving chemotherapy / bone marrow transplants were excluded, so the results cannot be extrapolated to these populations\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial suggests that procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy can reduce antibiotic administration without a significant effect on mortality outcomes\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Use of procalcitonin to reduce
