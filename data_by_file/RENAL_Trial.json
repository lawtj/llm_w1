NEJM 2009; 361:1627-1638 doi:10.1056/NEJMoa0902413\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill adults requiring renal replacement therapy, does higher intensity dialysis compared to lower intensity dialysis reduce mortality?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nProspective, parallel-group trial\nAllocation concealment achieved by computer generated sequence\nBlinding; unblinded to ensure safety with fluid administration\n1:1 allocation between higher intensity CRRT (40ml/Kg/hr) vs lower intensity\u00a0 CRRT (25ml/kg/hr)\nPrimary outcome = 90 day mortality\nSample size of 1500 calculated based on a 90% power of detecting an absolute risk reduction of 8.5% 90 day\u00a0mortality (from 60% to 51.5%). This conservative estimate in ARR in mortality was half that found in Ronco\u2019s trial published in the Lancet in 2000.\n\nSetting\n\n35 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand\nDecember 2005-November 2008\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nPatients had AKI and were deemed to require renal-replacement therapy, and had one of:\u00a0oliguria unresponsive to fluid therapy (<100ml/6hours), K+>6.5mmol/L, severe acidaemia (pH<7.2), uraemia (>25mmol/l), Creatinine>300umol/L OR clinically significant organ oedema.\nWritten informed consent available a priori or delayed\n\n\nExclusion: <18 years, death imminent (<24 hours), protocol violation likely, previous CRRT or dialysis on this hospital admission or long term dialysis.\n1508 patients were enrolled: 747 assigned to the higher-intensity group and 761 to the lower-intensity group.\nAll baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups.\n\nIntervention/Control\n\nAll patients were treated with CRRT in CVVHDF mode. Replacement fluid was delivered post-filter. The ratio of dialysate to replacement fluid was 1:1. The dose of dialysis (the effluent flow) was determined by the patient weight and was 40ml/kg/hr OR 25ml/kg/hr.\nBlood flow was kept above 150ml/min.\nFluid removal was achieved by altering the replacement fluid and dialysate flow in equal proportions.\nThe filter used was the same in each group.\nThe replacement fluid and dialysate fluid was Hemosol BO.\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\u00a0all cause death at 90 days\n\nDeath occurred in 322/721(44.7%) patients in the higher-intensity group\u00a0and 332/743 (44.7%) in the lower-intensity group. p=0.99\n\n\nSecondary/Tertiary outcomes: no differences noted (high intensity vs low intensity)\n\nDeath within 28 days of randomisation [38.5% vs 36.9% p =0.52]\nDeath in the ICU [34.8% vs 34.2% p=0.81]\nIn-hospital death after ICU discharge [9.4% vs 10.2% p=0.6]\nICU Duration [11.8 days vs 11.8 days p=0.95]\nHospital Duration [26 days vs 25.7 days p=0.79]\nDuration of mechanical ventilation [7.3 days vs 7.4 days p=0.79]\nDuration of renal replacement therapy [13 days vs 11.8 days p=0.14]\nDialysis status at Day 90 [6.8% vs 4.4% p=0.14]\nNew organ failures; no difference between groups\n\n\nPre-specified subgroups; sepsis, failure of one or more non-renal organs, SOFA score and baseline GFR. There were non-significant differences between each subgroup in 90 day mortality.\nHypophosphatemia more common in higher intensity group (65.1% vs 54% p<0.0001)\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIncreasing the intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy from 25ml/kg/hr to 40ml/kg/hr did not reduce mortality or the rate of dependence on dialysis among critically ill patients\n\nStrengths\n\nWell powered study and the largest trial examining this important question\nAllocation concealment\nComplete follow-up\nPredefined statistical analysis plan published before trial conducted\nSeparation in groups with the delivered dose 33.4ml/kg/hr in the high intensity group vs 22ml/kg/hr in the lower intensity group\nPre-specified subgroups\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnblinded\nDelivered dose less than prescribed dose\nThis study used mixed diffusive and convective clearance\u00a0and did not examine if one is superior to the other\nDifferences in costs not examined in this trial\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDelivering higher intensity dialysis dosing is not without risk. Some of the potential disadvantages are; disturbance in\u00a0 electrolyte concentrations, increased costs and nursing workload, micronutrient depletion and\u00a0subtherapeutic levels of antibiotics. This is the best trial examining \u2018dose\u2019 of dialysis in critically ill patients and stands the test of time, even 8 years after publishing. I will continue my practice of dialysing critically ill patients with AKI at 25ml/kg/hr.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Intensity of Continuous Renal-Replacement Therapy in Critically Ill Patients\n[further reading] Dialysis: getting it right in ICU.
