Lancet 2018; published on line 14th June. doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31080-8\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients with severe metabolic acidaemia (pH \u22647\u22c520), does the infusion of sodium bicarbonate, compared with no infusion, to reach and maintain a targeted pH of 7\u22c530 decrease the primary composite out\u00adcome of mortality by day 28 or the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7?\n\nBackground\n\nAcute acidaemia is frequently observed during critical illness\nPersistent acidaemia has been associated with poor prognosis\nSodium bicarbonate infusion for the treatment of severe metabolic acidaemia is a possible treatment option but remains controversial as no studies to date have examined its effect on clinical outcomes\n\nDesign\n\nMulticentre, open labelled, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial\nStratified randomisation according to study site and three pre-specified factors: age with a cutoff of 65 years, presence or absence of suspected sepsis and presence or absence of Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) score of 2 or 3\nComputer\u00ad generated allocation sequence\nNo physician or nurse blinding. Rationale was\u00a0sodium bicarbonate infusion influences arterial pH levels and because routine arterial blood gases must be done in critically ill patients\nDeferred consent process for emergency situations\nPlanned interim analysis\nIntention to treat analysis\nOn the basis of a previous study, a total of 376 patients were needed for an 80% statistical power to show an absolute difference of 15% between groups in the primary outcome at a two\u00ad-sided \u03b1 level of 0\u22c503 (0\u22c502 for the interim analysis and 0\u22c503 for the analysis), assuming that the administration of sodium bicarbonate would be associated with a decrease from 45% to 30% in the primary endpoint\n\nSetting\n\n26 French ICUs\nMay 2015 to May 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\u00a0adult patients (aged \u226518 years) who were admitted within 48 h to the ICU with severe acidaemia\n\npH \u22647\u22c520, PaCO2 \u226445 mm Hg, and sodium bicarbonate concentration \u226420 mmol/L\n\n\nAND with a total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 4 or more or an arterial lactate concentration of 2 mmol/L or more\nExclusion:\u00a0respiratory acidosis, proven digestive or urinary tract loss of sodium bicarbonate (volume loss \u22651500 mL per day), stage IV chronic kidney disease, ketoacidosis, and sodium bicarbonate infusion (including renal\u00ad replacement therapy) within 24 h before screening\n389 patients were included\n\n942 patients with severe metabolic acidaemia were assessed for trial eligibility. 542 were excluded and 400 were randomly assigned to the study groups. After secondary exclusion of 11 patients who withdrew consent, a total of 389 patients were included in the intention\u00ad to\u00ad treat analysis (n=194 in the control group and n=195 in the bicarbonate group).\n\n\nBaseline characteristics of the patients were well balanced between the two groups. At randomisation:\n\nsepsis was present in 238 (61%) patients\nacute kidney injury with AKIN scores of 2 or 3 in 182 (47%) patients\ninvasive mechanical ventilation was used in 324 (83%) of 389 patients\nvasopressors in 310 (80%) patients\nmedian SOFA score of 10 in both groups\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n4.2% sodium bicarbonate intravenously infused\n\naim of achieving an arterial pH of 7\u22c530 or more during the 28\u00ad day ICU admission or ICU discharge\nprotocol recommended that the volume of each sodium bicarbonate infusion should be within the range of 125\u2013250 mL in 30 min, with a maximum of 1000 mL within 24 h after inclusion\nmeasurement of arterial blood gas should be done 1\u20134 h after the end of each infusion\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNo infusion of intravenous 4.2% sodium bicarbonate or placebo\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nIndications for renal-replacement therapy (RRT) were standardised\nRRT was strongly recommended in the event of hyperkalaemia (>6\u22c55 mmol/L) with electrocardiogram signs or cardiogenic pulmonary oedema with no urine output, or both\nAt 24 h after inclusion, RRT was recommended when two of three criteria were present:\n\nurine output less than 0\u22c53 mL/kg per h for at least 24 h\narterial pH less than 7\u22c520 despite resuscitation\nhyperkalaemia (>6\u22c55 mmol/L)\n\n\nEach study site chose the method of RRT according to the local guidelines\nInitiation of invasive mechanical ventilation was indicated if patients had one major or two minor predefined clinical events\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: No statistical difference in composite of death from any cause by 28 days after randomisation and the presence of at least one organ failure at 7 days after randomisation\n\nComposite outcome: 138 (71%) of 194 patients in the control group and 128 (66%) of 195 in the bicarbonate group\n\nabsolute difference estimate \u20135\u22c55%, 95% CI \u201315\u22c52 to 4\u22c52; p=0\u22c524\n\n\nDay 28 mortality: 54% in the control group vs 45% in the bicarbonate group; p=0.07\nOne or more organ failure at day 7: 69% in the control group vs 62% in the bicarbonate group; p=0.15\nIn patients with Acute Kidney Injury (AKIN) score of 2-3 (n=182), there was a statistically significant difference in:\n\nprimary composite outcome: 74/90 (82%) in the control group vs 64/92 (70%) in the bicarbonate group; p=0\u00b70462\nday 28 mortality: 57/90 (63%) in the control group vs 42/92 (46%) in the bicarbonate group; p=0\u00b70166\none or more organ failure at day 7:\u00a074/90 (82%)in the control group vs 61/92 (66%) in the bicarbonate group; p=0\u00b70142\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nWorse outcomes in the control group, reaching statistical difference, in the following:\n\nUse of RRT during ICU stay: 100 (52%) vs 68 (35%); p=0\u00b70009\nMedian RRT-free days during ICU stay: 8 vs 19; p=0\u00b701\nTime (hours) from enrolment to initiation of renal replacement therapy: 7 vs 19; p=<0.0001\n\nHyperkalaemia and acidaemia main reasons for initiation of RRT in the control group whilst serum creatinine and serum blood urea nitrogen were the main reasons to start RRT in the bicarbonate group\n\n\n\n\nNo statistical difference in outcomes for control group vs sodium bicarbonate group in the following:\n\nRenal replacement therapy-free days during ICU stay in survivors\nMedian vasopressor free days: 9 vs 19; p=0.1\nDependence on dialysis at ICU discharge\nLength of ICU stay\n\n\nAdverse events\n\nMetabolic alkalosis, hypernatraemia, and hypocal\u00adcaemia were observed more frequently in the bicarbonate group than in the control group, with no life \u00adthreatening complications reported\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with severe metabolic acidaemia, sodium bicarbonate had no effect on the primary composite outcome. However, sodium bicarbonate decreased the primary composite outcome and day 28 mortality in the a-priori defined stratum of patients with acute kidney injury\n\nStrengths\n\nAn important clinical question is evaluated with patient focussed outcome measures\nMulticentre\nBaseline characteristics were well balanced\nData for the primary outcome were available for all patients\n\nWeaknesses\n\nComposite primary outcome\n24% of the control group received bicarbonate\n109 patients were excluded because they had already received sodium bicarbonate\nThe proportion of patients in whom the targeted pH of 7\u22c530 was reached and maintained for at least 36 h from enrolment to day 2 was only 60%. The control group achieved this same target in 26% of patients\nPhysicians were not blinded and there was no control infusion. The authors provide adequate explanation for this\nThe protocol suggested a range of 4\u22c52% sodium bicarbonate volume (125\u2013250 mL per infusion) in the bicarbonate group rather than using a formula to calculate the base deficit and provide a tailored sodium bicarbonate infusion; therefore, we cannot extrapolate whether different ways of administration would have resulted in different outcomes\nNo data was collected for mechanical ventilation settings which may have influenced the patients acid-base status\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with severe metabolic acidaemia, sodium bicarbonate treatment had no effect on the primary composite outcome (ie, mortality by day 28 or the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7)\nIn a subgroup of patients with acute kidney injury, sodium bicarbonate treatment did decrease the composite outcome and 28 day mortality although this may represent a type I error based on the outlined limitations of the study\nThis study will reassure clinicians that already use sodium bicarbonate for correcting metabolic acidaemia, that this may delay and/or reduce the requirement for RRT. Equally, for those that opt to avoid sodium bicarbonate, there is no compelling evidence to change practice\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Sodium bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidaemia in the intensive care unit (BICAR-ICU): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial\n[further reading] TBL editorial.\u00a0Early vs Late Renal Replacement Therapy (ELAIN vs AKIKI)\n[further reading] Josh Farkas.
