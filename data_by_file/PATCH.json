However, this was changed prior to knowledge of the outcome data\nDifferences in the baseline characteristics between the intervention and the control group\nLarge numbers of patients randomised\u00a0who had exclusion criteria\nNon-blinding of clinicians and patients\nSmall numbers of patients included\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis small randomised controlled trial demonstrated that patients with ICH who are on antiplatelet agents have worse neurological outcomes at 3 months if they are treated with a platelet transfusion compared with standard care alone. The trial has a number of weaknesses but\u00a0this is the best evidence we have and I do not think we should be using platelet transfusions for these patients outside of a clinical trial.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Platelet transfusion versus standard care after acute stroke due to spontaneous cerebral haemorrhage associated with antiplatelet therapy (PATCH): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial\n[further reading]\u00a0St Emlyns journal club\n[further reading]\u00a0REBEL EM The PATCH Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0EMLit of Note: Put the Platelets Away in ICH\n[further trial awaited]\u00a0Platelet Transfusion in Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date:\u00a021st June 2016\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@duncanchambler\n\n\n"
