DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2211868\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients in the ICU with delirium, does haloperidol compared with placebo, increase the number of days alive and out of the hospital at 90 days?\n\nBackground\n\nDelirium is very common in patients with critical illness and can affect 30-50% of patients admitted to the ICU\nHaloperidol, a typical antipsychotic, is the most frequent agent used to treat delirium in ICU patients despite minimal evidence of its benefit\nThe HOPE-ICU study found that early haloperidol did not prevent delirium\nThe MIND-USA study reported that the use of haloperidol or ziprasidone had no benefit on the duration of delirium\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nComputer generated randomisation\nVariable block sizes stratified by centre and delirium motor subtype (hyperactive or hypoactive)\nBlinding of patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors\nHaloperidol and placebo contained in identical ampoules and labels and were indistinguishable from one another\nIntervention ran until death, ICU discharge or 90 days\n1000 patients required for 90% power to detect 8% improvement in primary outcome, assuming that haloperidol would lead to 15% reduction in in-hospital death\nIntention to treat analysis included patients that were randomised and received assigned study drug\nSecondary analysis of the primary outcome was adjusted for additional predefined risk factors at baseline\n\nSetting\n\nScreening performed at 18 general ICUs in Europe, of whom 16 ICUs randomised patients\nDates of data collection: June 2018 \u2013 April 2022\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n\u226518 years old\nAdmitted to ICU for acute condition\nDiagnosed with delirium based on either\n\nConfusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) or\nIntensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC)\n\n\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nContraindications to haloperidol\nTreatment with antipsychotic \u2013 either regularly or in ICU prior to inclusion\nDelirium assessment not possible\nAlcohol induced delirium/delirium tremens\nPregnancy\n\n\n1000 patients randomised, 13 patients excluded post randomisation\n\nPrimary outcome date obtained from 963 patients\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of haloperidol vs. placebo group\n\nAge: 70 vs. 71\nFemale: 35 vs. 33%\nRisk factor for delirium\n\nAlcohol overconsumption: 17 vs. 16%\nReceived benzodiazepines in hospital before randomisation: 33 vs. 29%\nReceived haloperidol in hospital before ICU admission: 7 vs. 7%\n\n\nMedical admission type: 64 vs. 69%\nSurgical admission type: 37 vs.

randomisation: 45 vs. 46%\nMedian type from ICU admission to randomisation: 3.9 vs. 4.1 days\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nHaloperidol\n\n2.5mg IV TDS\nAdditional doses allowed \u2013 up to total of 20mg/day\nPatients received a median daily dose of 8.3mg for a median of 3.6 days\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nPatients screened twice daily for delirium\nTreatment of study drug paused if delirium not present when screened (defined as two consecutive negative screening tests)\n\nIntervention could be resumed if subsequent delirium screen positive, or readmitted to ICU and delirium present\n\n\nPatients could receive rescue medication (propofol, benzodiazepines, or \u03b12 -agonists) at the discretion of the clinical team for uncontrollable delirium\n\nUse of other antipsychotic drugs was not permitted\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Number of days alive and out of the hospital by day 90\nComparing haloperidol vs place group: no significant difference\n\n35.8 vs. 32.9\nAdjusted absolute difference 2.9 (95% C.I. -1.2 to 7), P=0.22\n\n\nDeath at 90 days \u2013 significantly lower in haloperidol group\n\n36.3 vs. 43.3%\nAdjusted absolute difference -6.9 (95% C.I. -13 to -0.6)\nData missing for 24 patients\nFragility index 4 patients\n\n\nMean length of hospital stay \u2013 no significant difference\n\n28.8 vs 26.4 days\nAdjusted absolute difference: 2.3 (95% C.I. -0.6 to 5.1)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: \nComparing haloperidol vs. placebo group\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nDays alive without delirium or coma\n\n57.7 vs. 52.6\nAdjusted absolute difference 5.1 (95% C.I. -1.2 to 11.3)\n\n\nSerious adverse reaction in ICU\n\n2.2% vs. 1.9%\n\n\nUse of rescue medication\n\nTotal\n\n57.5% vs. 62.1%\n\n\nPropofol\n\n17.6%

significantly greater number of days alive and out of the hospital at 90 days than placebo\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nBlinded\nMulti-centre\nValidated assessment tools for diagnosing delirium\n\nWeaknesses\n\nLow number of patients from international sites may limit external validity\nComposite outcome\nPower calculation based on reduction in mortality of 15% which may have been overly optimistic\nUse of open label antipsychotics was 13%, although similar in both groups\nHigh rate of major protocol violations ~20%\n25% of those screened were excluded due to prior antipsychotic use in the ICU. This may lead to a selection bias\nHigh rates of hypoactive delirium treated with haloperidol which is not standard practice in my institution\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients admitted to the ICU who develop delirium, the use of haloperidol compared with placebo did not significantly improve the number of days alive and out of the hospital by day 90\nThe mortality benefit noted with the use of haloperidol needs to be treated with caution due to the fact that it was not the primary outcome, and the number of patients with missing data exceeds the fragility index\nIn patients with hyperactive delirium I will continue to use haloperidol to treat symptoms despite the minimal evidence for its benefit on longer term outcomes. Larger trials would be needed to investigate any mortality benefit\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Haloperidol for the Treatment of Delirium in ICU Patients\nfurther reading Management of Delirium in the ICU\nfurther reading Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency: Review of the use of haloperidol in elderly patients with acute delirium\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 1st December 2022\nPeer-review editor: George Walker\nPicture by: Pixabay/M Wewering\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
