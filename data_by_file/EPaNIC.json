New England Journal of Medicine 2011;365(6):506-17.\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill adult patients, does late supplemental parenteral nutrition (PN), compared with early PN reduce the duration of dependency on intensive care?\n\nBackground\n\nThis is an important nutrition paper published in 2011. At this time European guidelines recommended initiating PN within 2 days of admission to the ICU for patients who could not be adequately enterally fed. Whereas the American guideline recommended withholding PN and tolerating hypocaloric nutrition during the first week in patients who were not malnourished at baseline. This study aimed to compare these two practices.\n\nDesign\n\nProspective, parallel-group, multicentre randomised controlled trial\nUnblinded\nConsecutive patients\nStratified allocation according to 16 disease categories\nAllocation concealment maintained by sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. Replaced by a digital system during the study\nPermitted blocks of 10 per stratum (treating team unaware of block size)\nPower calculation: 4640 patients provided a power of 80% to detect a 1 day change in ICU stay and 70% power to detect a change of 3% in the rate of ICU death, at an alpha level of 0.05.\nIntention to treat analysis\n\nSetting\n\n7 ICUs in Belgium\nData collected: August 2007- November 2010\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nAdult patient admitted to the ICU\nNutritionally Risk Screening (NRS) score \u22653 (indicative that the patient was nutritionally at risk)\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nKetoacidotic or hyperosmolar coma on admission\nBMI < 17 (kg/m2)\nShort Bowel Syndrome\nPregnancy or lactating\nTaking oral nutrition\nMoribund or coded DNR\nHome mechanical ventilation\nNo central catheter\n\n\n8703 screened for eligibility, of whom 4640 underwent randomisation\nGroups were comparable at baseline, comparing late vs. early groups\n\nMale: 63.8% vs. 64.3%\nAge: 64 vs. 64\nWeight: 75kg vs. 76kg\nDiabetes: 17.9% vs. 16.9%\nCardiac surgery:60.5% vs. 61%\nAPACHE II score: 23 vs. 23\nNutritional risk screening score\n\n3: 45.1% vs. 43.9%\n4/5: 45.9% vs. 46.8%\n6/7: 8.9% vs. 9.3%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nLate parenteral nutrition\n\n5% dextrose in volume equal to that of PN in the early group\nIf oral diet could not be started on day 2, enteral nutrition (EN) was initiated\nIf EN was insufficient after 7 days, PN was initiated on day 8 to meet caloric goal\nReceived a median of 31 units of insulin to reach target blood glucose level\n\n\n\nControl\n\nEarly parenteral nutrition\n\n20% dextrose targeted to provided 400kcal on day 1 and 800kcal on day 2\nIf oral diet could not be started on day 2, EN was initiated\nPN initiated on day 3 (OlioClinomel or Clinimix, Baxter) to provide 100% of the caloric goal when combined with EN\nPN was not started if patient expected to tolerate adequate EN\nWhen EN covered 80% of the calorie goal or oral intake was commenced the PN was stopped\nWhen EN or oral intake fell to less than 50% of the goal, PN was restarted.\nReceived a median of 58 units of insulin to achieve target blood glucose level\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nStanding orders specified twice daily review for increase on EN, prokinetic agents, duodenal feeding tubes\nReceived early parenteral trace elements, minerals and vitamins\nPatient data management system (MetaVision) was used to calculate daily EN and PN targets\nIdeal body weight was used for energy calculations\nCalories provided was capped at 2880. Kcal/day\nIntensive insulin therapy (IIT) was provided to maintain blood glucose levels of 4.4-6.1 mmol/L\nManagement of nutrition after ICU stay was as per the treating medical team\n\nComparison of nutrition delivery between the two groups\n\nNo statement in the paper, but from the figures provided, patients in the early initiation group received approximately 25-30 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day from study day 3 and patients in the late group received 25-30 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day after day 8.\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Duration of ICU stay (defined as time from admission until met pre-specified criteria for discharge, regardless of whether they were actually discharged that day) \u2013 significantly reduced in late group\n\n3 days (IQR 2-7) vs. 4 days (2-9), p=0.02\n\n\nSafety outcomes\n\nDischarged live from ICU within 8 days \u2013 significantly increased in late group\n\n75.2% vs. 71.7%, p=0.007\n\n\nMortality rates \u2013 no significant difference\n\nIn ICU: 6.1% vs. 6.3%\nIn hospital: 10.4% vs. 10.9%\nAt 90 days: 11.2% vs. 11.2%\n\n\nHypoglycaemia during intervention \u2013 significantly increased in late group\n\n3.5% vs. 1.9%, p=0.001\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes, comparing late vs. early groups:\n\nLate group had significantly lower:\n\nNew infections\n\nAny: 22.8% vs. 26.2%, p=0.008\nAirway or lung: 16.4% vs. 19.3%, p=0.009\nBloodstream: 6.1% vs. 7.5%, p=0.05\n\n\nDuration of mechanical ventilation >2 days\n\n36.3% vs. 40.2%, p=0.006\n\n\nDuration of renal replacement therapy\n\n7 days vs. 10 days, p=0.008\n\n\nDuration of hospital stay\n\n14 days vs. 16 days, p=0.004\n\n\nHealth Care Cost\n\n\u20ac16,863 vs. \u20ac17,973, p=0.04\n\n\n\n\nLate group had significantly higher\n\nMedian C-reactive protein level\n\n190.6 vs. 159.7, p<0.001\n\n\n\n\nNo significant differences in functional status at hospital discharge\n\n6 minute walk: 227m vs. 283m (1227 completed assessment)\n\n\n\n\nPre-defined subgroup analysis \u2013 no difference in primary outcome or rate of discharged alive from ICU within 8 days for:\n\nPatients at increased risk as indicated by the body-mass index <25 or >40 and NRS score \u22655\nCardiac surgery patients\nSepsis on admission\n\n\nPost-hoc subgroup analysis \u2013 patients for whom early enteral nutrition was surgically contraindicated (n=517)\n\nRates of infection \u2013 significantly lower in late group\n\n29.9% vs. 40.2%, p=0.01\n\n\nLikelihood of earlier discharge from ICU \u2013 significantly greater in late group\n\nHazard ratio 1.2 (95% C.I. 1-1.44, p=0.05)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nEarly parenteral nutrition to supplement insufficient enteral nutrition appears inferior to late parenteral nutrition\n\nStrengths\n\nLarge scale, robustly conducted RCT (largest in ICU nutrition to date)\nSpecified objective criteria for when patient was ready for the ward\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\nIntention to treat analysis\nAllocation concealment maintained\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNon-blinded\nUse of intensive insulin therapy makes the results difficult to generalise to ICUs who do not use intensive insulin therapy\nShort ICU length of stay (3 vs 4 days), raises a question whether the patients included needed artificial nutrition therapy at all\nMajority of patients had left the trial by day 8 when the late intervention was commenced (655 in late group and 736 in early group at day 7\nSignificant amounts of IV dextrose used in the intervention group- is this the signal the study is picking up?\nPrimary outcome was not patient centred\n\nCompeting Interests\n\nBaxter Healthcare provided research grant but were not involved in design of the study, analysis of data, or decision to submit for publication.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCritically ill patients receiving late supplemental parenteral nutrition were more likely to be discharged alive and earlier from the ICU compared to standard care. There was no difference in the mortality rates in hospital or at 90 days.\nIntensive insulin therapy and significant amounts of IV dextrose were used and thus make the results difficult to generalise to populations where this is not standard practice.\nThere is a question if the patients in this trial required artificial nutrition therapy at all given the short length of stay and high rate of cardiac surgery patients.\nPractice change can not be recommended, particularly for ICUs who see more unwell patients than those included in this trial and where intensive insulin therapy is not standard care.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Early versus Late Parenteral Nutrition in Critically Ill Adults\n[further reading]\u00a0LITFL: Nutrition Literature Summaries\n[further reading]\u00a0TBL: Nutrition papers\n[further reading]\u00a0ESPEN Guidelines 2009 on Parenteral Nutrition: Intensive care\n[further reading]\u00a0ASPEN Guidelines 2016: Guidelines for the Provision and Assessment of Nutrition Support Therapy in the Adult Critically Ill Patient\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Emma Ridley\u00a0@icunutrition\nSummary date: 21/02/2018\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@davidslessor\n\n\n"
