DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1507581\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), does hypothermia (32-35\u00b0C) and standard care\u00a0compared to standard care alone reduce death and major disability at 6 months after injury?\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, multi-country RCT with a weighted recruitment to increase UK population\nCentralised randomisation with minimisation procedure to balance centre, age, GCS motor score, time from injury and pupillary response\nAppropriate concealment of allocation until inclusion\nOpen-label \u2013 patients, families and treating clinicians aware\nOutcome assessor blinded\nPilot trial period with subsequent adjustment of inclusion criteria and target sample size\nPowered at 80% to detect a 9% absolute reduction in the rate of unfavourable outcomes from an expected incidence of 60% in the standard care group with 0.05 two-sided alpha significance level, if 600 patients were included\n\nThis was initially 1800, but this was adjusted after the pilot trial period identified a higher incidence of pathology with raised intracranial pressure in the study population and a change in the statistical method (ordinal analysis of outcome measure rather than binomial)\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n55 centres (although only 47 actually recruited) in 18 countries\n\n53% patients recruited in UK\n\n\nNov 2009 \u2013 Oct 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adults with a primary closed TBI and intracranial pressure of more than 20mmHg for at least 5 minutes after stage 1 treatments with no obvious reversible cause\n\n\nstage 1 treatment\n\nmandatory: mechanical ventilation; sedation; analgesia; head of bed elevated to 30 degrees; intravenous fluids with or without inotropes to maintain mean arterial pressure > 80mmHg\noptional: ventriculostomy with or without CSF drainage; surgical removal of space occupying lesion\n\n\n\nan initial head injury that occurred no more than 10 days earlier\navailability of a cooling device or technique for > 48 hours\ncore temperature of at least 36\u00b0C\u00a0at time of randomisation\nabnormal CT brain\n\n\nExclusion: patients already receiving therapeutic hypothermia or were unlikely to survive for the next 24 hours; barbiturates infused prior to randomisation; temperature <34\u00b0C\u00a0at hospital admission, and pregnancy\n2498 patients were screened, 387 were randomised, 386 received intended treatment, 376 were evaluated in an intention to treat analysis\n\nIntervention\n\nTherapeutic hypothermia (32-35\u00b0C) for at least 48 hours and continued until ICP controlled + standard care\n\nCooling achieved by bolus of 20-30mls/kg of refrigerated, intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride and then maintained using individuals departments usual practice\nCore temperature was reduced by the minimum required to maintain ICP of 20mmHg or less\nStage 2 treatments were added if hypothermia failed to control ICP\n\nIncluded: mannitol; hypertonic saline; inotropes to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure of >60mmHg\n\n\nStage 3 treatments were added if ICP was still inadequately controlled\n\nIncluded: barbiturate therapy with processed EEG monitoring; decompressive craniectomy further surgical intervention if required\n\n\nRewarming strategy was controlled at 0.25\u00b0C\u00a0per hour once ICP was controlled\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard care\n\nStage 1 treatment and escalation to stage 2 and then 3 if ICP was not controlled\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nOrdinal analysis of the Extended Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS-E) at 6 months after injury, with adjustment for covariates, demonstrate a shift to poorer outcomes in the hypothermia group\nBinomial analysis of GOS-E (good outcome vs bad outcome) also demonstrated a statistically significant difference favouring standard care\n\nGood outcome in hypothermia group 25.7% vs standard care group 36.5%\nAbsolute risk increase 10.85% (95% CI 1.61% to 20.10%); NNH = 10; p=0.03\nAdjusted common odds ratio 1.53 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.30; p-value 0.04)\nFragility Index is 3\n\nIf 3 patients in the experimental group (hypothermia) had a good outcome instead of a bad outcome, then it would no longer be considered statistically significant using Fishers Exact test \u2013 however it is worth noting that this binomial analysis was not the main statistical method the authors used; the ordinal analysis above provides greater statistical strength\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\n6 month mortality was statistically significantly increased in the hypothermia group\nFailure of all stage 2 therapies to control ICP occurred less often in the hypothermia group\n\nMore barbiturates were used in the standard care group, but there was no difference in the incidence of decompressive craniectomy\n\n\nIncidence of pneumonia at days 1-7 was no different between the groups\nLength of ICU stay was not different between the groups\nModified Oxford Handicap Scale (MOHS) grade at day 28 or discharge from an acute-care hospital was not statistically significantly different between the groups\nSerious adverse events were more common in the hypothermia group\n\n33 events vs. 10 events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with intracranial pressure of more than 20mmHg after TBI, therapeutic hypothermia plus standard care to reduce intracranial pressure did not result in better outcomes compared with standard care alone\n\nStrengths\n\nTrial protocol was published a priori\u00a0http://www.eurotherm3235trial.eu/protocol/index.phtml\nParticipating centres all had evidence of expertise with intracranial-pressure monitoring and therapeutic cooling\nRewarming strategy was controlled at 0.25\u00b0C per hour\nUse of higher strength statistical methods based on ordinal outcome scale\nPatient centred outcomes rather than physiological measure (e.g. ICP)\nCombined death, vegetative state and severe disability into one GOS-E category so that conclusion would not favour severely disabled survivors (however, this modification of the previously validated scale could be considered a weakness)\nPragmatic and based on existing guidelines (Stage 1, 2 and 3 therapy for raised ICP)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe inclusion criteria was changed during the study to remove an upper age limit (previously 65 years) and to increase the time from injury from 72 hours to 10 days\nEarly termination risks bias (tends to over estimate effect magnitude) however remaining results collected after termination did not show regression toward the mean suggesting this is not the case in this trial\nLoss of outcome data for 10 cases (given fragility index was 3, these 10 could have changed the result significantly)\nLack of data on additional Stage 2 therapies limits opportunity to draw new hypotheses \u2013 it could be that some other Stage 2 therapy caused the harm / benefit effect seen in this trial and that hypothermia was not the causal therapy\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with elevated intracranial pressure after TBI, therapeutic hypothermia, in addition to standard treatment, results in a greater risk of death and worse neurological outcomes in survivors compared to standard measures\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Eurotherm3235 Trial: Hypothermia for Intracranial Hypertension after Traumatic Brain Injury\n[further reading] Supplementary appendix\u00a0\n[further reading] JC: EuroTHERM or EuroBURN.
