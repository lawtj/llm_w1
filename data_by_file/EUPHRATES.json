A dialysis catheter was cut to simulate insertion and taped to the skin beneath an opaque dressing\n\n0.9% saline was recirculated in the circuit for 2 hours to simulate a haemoperfusion treatment\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nConventional medical therapy according to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical practice guidelines for the management of sepsis\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: No statistical difference in mortality at 28 days in the polymyxin B haemoperfusion group compared with the sham group\n\n37.7% (84 of 223) vs 34.5% (78 of 226)\nRisk difference [RD], 3.15; 95% CI, \u22125.73 to 12.04; risk ratio [RR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.85-1.39; P = 0.49\nIn patients with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, 28-day mortality was 44.5% (65 of 146) in the polymyxin B haemoperfusion group and 43.9% (65 of 148) in the sham group (RD, 0.60; 95%CI, \u221210.75 to 11.97; RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.78-1.31; P = 0.92)\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\n264 serious adverse events were reported, with 10.8% of polymixin B patients experiencing worsening of sepsis, compared with 9.1% of sham patients\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong patients with septic shock and high endotoxin activity, polymyxin B haemoperfusion treatment plus conventional medical therapy compared with sham treatment plus conventional medical therapy did not reduce mortality at 28 days\n\nStrengths\n\nThe investigators attempted to blind the study as much as possible to reduce bias\nThe patient cohort was sick, with mean APACHE II scores of around 30\nThe multi-centre nature of the study improves external validity within the North American setting\nGroups were well-matched at baseline for most variables\nA safety analysis was performed, with most adverse events related to the indwelling vascular access device\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe study took 6 years to enrol 450 patients, and this was after a power calculation for a very optimistic absolute risk reduction of 15% in 28-day mortality\nFollowing the second interim analysis, the study protocol was adjusted to enroll only patients with a very high severity of illness based on a Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS) of more than 9\nThe bedside nurse and research co-ordinators were aware of treatment allocation, possibly introducing bias\n28-day mortality was used as the primary outcome measure, rather than 90-day mortality\nAs this is still an experimental therapy, the dose, timing and duration of haemoperfusion therapy is uncertain, and may not have been sufficient to clear circulating endotoxin, as suggested by the therapy failing to produce significant reductions in circulating endotoxin levels\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPolymyxin B haemoperfusion was not shown to be superior to placebo in the management of septic shock. I will not be incorporating this therapy in the management of septic shock patients on the Intensive Care Unit\nThe heterogenous nature of patients with sepsis means that there are limitations in researching targeted therapies. Studies such as this one, incorporating a specific subgroup of septic patients, are welcome\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of Targeted Polymyxin B Hemoperfusion on 28-Day Mortality in Patients With Septic Shock and Elevated Endotoxin Level\nThe EUPHRATES Randomized Clinical Trial\n[further reading] Polymyxin B haemoperfusion in peritonitis\n[further reading]\u00a0Claudio Ronco article on polymyxin B\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Fraser Magee\nSummary date: 18th October 2018\nPeer-review editor: Steve Mathieu\n\n\n"
