Journal of Critical care 2017; 41: 130-137. DOI: 10.1016/j.jcrc.2017.05.008\nClinical Question\n\nIn spontaneously breathing critically unwell patients undergoing resuscitation, does the collapsibility of the inferior vena cava (cIVC), when compared to administering a fluid bolus predict a >10% increase in cardiac output?\n\nBackground\n\nIV Fluid resuscitation remains one of the cornerstones of intensive care practice. However over-resuscitation has been associated with a worse outcome in critically unwell patients\nConservative fluid strategies, where fluid is given only if the circulation requires it, have been designed around the concept of \u201cfluid responsiveness\u201d. This involves giving fluids only if measures suggest that the cardiac output will increase by a preset value following the fluid bolus\nMultiple methods exist to assess fluid responsiveness- static (e.g. CVP, PCWP) and dynamic (PPV, SVV, Aortic VTI, and IVC collapsibility)\nAssessing the collapsibility (or distensibility if the patient is mechanically ventilated) of the IVC during respiration using point of care ultrasound (POCUS) has been recommended by some clinicians as a means to assess fluid responsiveness, however this is controversial\n\nDesign\n\nProspective observational study\n\u201cConvenience\u201d sample of spontaneously breathing patients with acute circulatory failure being admitted to the ICU\nUltrasound were reviewed after they were performed by a reviewer blinded to the NICOM results\nintra- and inter-observer variability of IVC compared using ANOVA:\n\nIntra-observer correlation coefficient 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89-0.95)\nInter-observer correlation coefficient 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56-0.76)\n\n\nROC analysis used to compare baseline cIVC\u2019s ability to predict fluid responsiveness\nPower calculation: A sample size of 124 patients needed to detect a difference between AUC for cIVC of at least 0.88 and an AUC of 0.70 (90% power, one sided alpha 0.05)\n\nSetting\n\n2 adult academic hospitals in the USA\nMedical ICU and emergency departments\nAugust 2014-July 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nPatients with acute circulatory failure, defined as:\n1- hypotension (a MAP <65mmHg or a systolic BP <90mmHg for >30 minutes)\n2- Decreased urine output (<0.5ml/kg/hr)\n3- Persistent tachycardia (HR >120 bpm for >30 minutes)\nAnd/or- serum markers suggesting organ hypo perfusion (acidosis with a pH <7.3 or lactate >2meq/l)\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nPrimary traumatic, cariogenic, obstructive or neurogenic shock\nAge <18\nIncarceration\nPregnancy\nHospitalisation for >36 hrs\nReceiving non-invasive ventilation\nClinical impression of active pulmonary oedema\nClinical impression of further IV fluid administration posing clinical risk\n\n\n287 screened, 154 consented, 124 included in final analysis\nWhen groups classified by fluid responsiveness, baseline characteristics mostly similar\n11 COPD patients in \u201cresponder\u201d group vs 1 in \u201cnon-responder group\u201d\n\u00a0Average of 4L fluid given in each group before enrolment\n\nIntervention\n\nIVC POCUS performed by one of 3 study physicians who had been trained in ultrasound\nPerformed in subcostal long axis, 2D B-mode, at junction of RA and IVC, using low frequency phased array probe\nMeasurements performed throughout native respiratory cycle\nMeasurements taken 3cm caudal to IVC/RA junction. Maximum and minimum diameter identified through visual inspection\n2 baseline ten-second measurements of IVC recorded 1 minute apart\n3 minute passive leg raise performed; a third ten-second measurement of IVC recorded\n500ml 0.9% saline bolus administered through participant\u2019s largest gauge IV\nFinal IVC measurement performed on completion of fluid bolus\n\nControl\n\nIn all patients Cheetah NICOM devices attached and calibrated for 3 mins at start of study\nCardiac index recorded at one minute intervals throughout study\nPassive leg raise and fluid bolus performed as per IVC group\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nIf patients were on vasopressors, rate was held constant throughout study\n\nOutcome\n\n61 (49.2%) fluid responders\nPrimary outcome: Discriminating ability of cIVC to detect fluid response: AUC 0.84 (95% CI: 0.76-0.91)\n\nOptimal cut off for discrimination was cIVC of 24.6% (Sensitivity 88.5% w/ 95% CI 77.8-95.3; Specificity 81.0% with 95% CI 69.1-89.1)\n+ve likelihood ratio of cIVC 25% 4.56 (95% CI 2.72-7.66)\n-ve likelihood ratio of cIVC 25% 0.16 (95% CI 0.08- 0.31)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nComparison of optimal cutoff of cIVC in this study to previous studies, using cIVC of 25% resulted in 16.1% misclassification rate, as opposed to 40% or 42% (34.7% misclassification rate, and 36.3% misclassification rate respectively)\nIncorporating PLR with cIVC did not improve discriminatory characteristics\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\ncIVC as measured by POCUS is able to detect fluid responsiveness and may be used to guide IV Fluid resuscitation among spontaneously breathing critically ill patients.\n\nStrengths\n\nReal-world pragmatic design\nStandardised protocol for cIVC assessment\nBlinding of cIVC assessors\nCardiac output monitor used to assess fluid responsiveness\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNot randomised\n\u201cConvenience\u201d sampling resulted in only 125 patients being randomised over two years\nNICOM has been shown to be inaccurate in tracking CO in critically unwell and in tracking improvements with CO using PLR (https://academic.oup.com/bja/article/111/6/961/292109/Bioreactance-is-not-reliable-for-estimating)- this trial may well be comparing cIVC to an inaccurate monitor\nThe flaws in NICOM could be why 11/12 of the COPD patients in the trial were \u201cfluid responsive\u201d- by relying on trans thoracic impedance large swings in intrathoracic pressure could skew the cardiac output results\nInter-observer variability of cIVC demonstrated to be 0.67 between 3 trained clinicians; this seems rather low for an \u201caccurate\u201d test\nNo long term, or patient focused, outcomes recorded- I would have liked to know if giving fluids was actually the right thing to do if they were fluid responsive\nThe majority (50%) of fluid responders had septic shock, which is arguably not a hypovolaemic state\nThe median amount of fluid given before enrolment was 4 litres over a median period of 16 hours- many clinicians are assessing fluid responsiveness much earlier than this, limiting the study\u2019s external validity\nNo mention of absolute IVC diameter- many clinicians use this as a guide to fluid responsiveness as well\ncIVC measurement in a single plane is not recommended by some experts- the IVC may be more complex than just a straightforward cylinder\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe lack of randomisation, lack of comparison to a true gold standard cardiac monitor, unavailability of patient-centred outcomes, and the use of a flawed method of measuring the IVC means that I cannot recommend cIVC in isolation as a measure of fluid responsiveness on the basis of this study\nI will cautiously and contentiously continue to use cIVC as part of my focused echo assessment, and will consider it in conjunction with other clinical parameters when deciding to give IV fluids\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Corl KA et al.
