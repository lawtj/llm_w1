Post-hoc analysis performed involving re-examination of these 3 patients SEP recordings and 10 other patients SEPs by 2 blinded experienced neurophysiologists\nSpecificity for Post-hoc analysis: 100% (95% C.I. 97-100) as concluded that the 3 absent SEPs were undeterminable due to too much noise in the registration\n\n\nN20 SEP during normothermia and when thought to have cleared effects of sedative drugs: specificity 100%\n\n\nOptimum cutoff value for NSE\n\nLevels taken at 48 hours had largest area under ROC curve: 0.82 (95% C.I. 0.77-0.86)\n\nNSE >81.8 \u00b5g/l had specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 18%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest, absent pupillary light responses or absent corneal reflexes at 72 hours or bilaterally absent cortical N20 SEP can reliably predict a poor outcome\n\nStrengths\n\nProspective\nMulti-centre\nMinimal loss to follow up\nBlinding of treating physicians to NSE results and to initial SEP result\n\nWeaknesses\n\nClinicians were not blinded to result of repeat SEP tests and it was common practice to use an absent response as an indication to withdraw treatment. As the authors state this can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy as treatment is withdrawn on the basis of this test, and the withdrawal of treatment itself can lead to a poor outcome.\nWe are not told the length of time that physicians waited before determining that the effect of sedatives had been cleared\nIt is not stated if clinicians determining primary outcome were blinded to tests of interest\nThe study found disagreement between reviewers interpreting SEP results. However, we are not told the Kappa score (inter-rater agreement)\nThe post-hoc analysis included only a small number of patients. Bias may also have been introduced by asking clinicians to perform a re-analysis.\nWith only moderate numbers of patients included in the study the confidence intervals for some of the results are relatively wide.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest the use of clinical examination at 72 hours,\u00a0neuronspecific enolase and\u00a0somatosensory-evoked potentials can help predict a poor outcome. The methodological limitations and wide confidence intervals mean that I would not use a single test to predict a poor outcome and will continue to use a multimodal approach as recommended by the ERC/ESICM\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Prognosis of coma after therapeutic hypothermia: a prospective cohort study.\n[further reading]\u00a0Prognostication in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest: An advisory statement from the European Resuscitation Council and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine\n[further reading]\u00a0The NNT: Likelihood ratios\n[further reading]\u00a0American Clinical Neurophysiology Society: Guidelines on Short-Latency Somatosensory Evoked Potentials\n[further reading]\u00a0ROC Curves\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 15th April 2015\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n"
