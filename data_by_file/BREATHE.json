With Respiratory Failure\nPerkins JAMA 2018;320(18):1881-1888. doi:10.1001/JAMA.2018.13763\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients on invasive mechanical ventilation who are difficult to wean, does extubation and weaning on non-invasive ventilation compared to weaning on invasive ventilation reduce the time until liberation from mechanical ventilation?\n\nBackground\n\nProlonged ventilation is associated with and probably causative of increased morbidity and mortality\nWeaning from mechanical ventilation can be difficult in approximately 1/3 patients, and guidelines recommend breathing trials, optimal (minimal) sedation, protocolised care and early mobilisation, although these are all difficult to implement in complex patients\nTerminology can be confusing, so here are some definitions used within this summary:\n\nMechanical ventilation (MV) = positive pressure controlled assisted breathing via either invasive or non-invasive methods\nWeaning = process of transition from mandatory mechanical ventilation to the patient breathing without support, which commences from the time pressure supported ventilation is initiated\nInvasive MV = positive pressure mechanical ventilation applied via an endotracheal tube\nNon-invasive MV = positive pressure mechanical ventilation applied via a face mask (of which there are various designs and sizes)\nExtubation = removal of endotracheal tube from a patient\u2019s airway\nLiberation = cessation of mechanical ventilation so that the patient is spontaneously breathing without pressure support (may still be receiving supplemental oxygen)\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\nMulti-centre UK-based\nEndorsed by UK Intensive Care Foundation with appropriate ethical approval\nWeb-based randomisation method to maintain allocation concealment\nRandomisation in 1:1 ratio with minimisation algorithm\n\nStratified by hospital, presence of COPD and post-operative status\n\n\nInterventions were not blinded, so all staff were aware of allocation\n\nCare bundles and criteria for key decision stages were defined to reduce bias from awareness of allocation\nUnrelated therapies and treatments were otherwise at the discretion of the bedside clinician\n\n\nStatistical analysis was on principle of intention-to-treat\nInternal pilot study built in to the first 6 months with same trial protocol, and all data included in final analysis\nInitial sample target was 920 but this was drastically reduced after a review of pilot data at the request of the funding body\n\nThis reduction also changed the intended analysis method from the a priori statistical plan that had been published (from competing risks regression model to a Cox proportional hazards model)\n\n\nSample size calculation estimated 364 patients were required for 90% power with the following assumptions\n\nMedian duration of weaning 2.9 days\nClinically important difference of 1 day\n\nDefined by clinicians and attention representatives\nWould give a hazard ratio of 1.53\n\n\nStatistical significance 0.05\nSample size inflation by 23% for losses and estimated distribution of outcome (Weilbull distribution with shape parameter = 0.918 and non-constant hazards \u2013 this means they expected many early liberations with a few long weaning patients and uncontrolled random factors influencing this)\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n41 general adult ICUs across United Kingdom\nMarch 2013 to October 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: adult patients on invasive mechanical ventilation through endotracheal tube for more than 48 hours; ready to commence weaning; failed spontaneous breathing trial\nExclusion: pregnancy; tracheostomy; contraindications to non-invasive ventilation; neurological deficits; home ventilation prior to admission; treatment limitations; need for further surgery or sedation; required equipment not available\n1752 patients screened; 1388 excluded (95% because they were extubated after a successful breathing trial \u2013 that is, they were not difficult to wean from MV); 364 patients randomised\nBaseline characteristics were similar between groups (Invasive weaning vs Non-invasive weaning)\n\nMean age: 61.8 vs 64.3 years\nEvidence of delirium: 9.3% vs 12.6%\nDuration of MV prior to randomisation: 4.7 vs 5.3 days\nAdmission reason:\n\nPost-surgical: 21.4% vs 21.4%\nCOPD: 3.9% vs 3.9%\nPneumonia: 40.1% vs 31.3%\nCardiac: 9.9% vs 14.8%\n\n\nParameters prior to spontaneous breathing trial\n\nMinute ventilation: 10.5 vs 10.2 l/min\nResp rate: 21 vs 21\nPEEP: 5 vs 5\nPressure Support: 11 vs 11 cmH2O\nP:F ratio: 242 (32) vs 227 (30) mmHg (kPa)\nSpontaneous breathing tidal volume: 8.2 vs 7.9 ml/kg\npH: 7.4 vs 7.4\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nNon-invasive Ventilation Weaning Protocol\n\nPatients were extubated and immediately placed on non-invasive mechanical ventilation via a face mask\nInspiratory positive airway pressure set to pre-extubation pressure support level\nExpiratory positive airway pressure set to pre-extubation positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)\nTitrated to achieve patient comfort and less than 30/min respiratory rate\nReassessed every two hours \u2013 if no distress or fatigue:\n\nEither non-invasive ventilation mask was removed for an unsupported spontaneous breathing trial and liberation from mechanical ventilation\nOr level of positive airway pressure reduced by 2 cmH2O\n\n\nWeaning protocol was terminated after 12 hours of unsupported spontaneous breathing\n\n\n\nControl\n\nInvasive Ventilation weaning protocol\n\nPatients remained intubated and mechanically ventilated via their endotracheal tube\nReassessed every two hours\n\nIf no distress or fatigue, pressure support was reduced by 2 cmH2O\nIf signs of distress or fatigue, reversible causes were treated and / or the pressure support was increased by 2 cmH2O\n\n\nSpontaneous breathing trials were performed daily to assess suitability for extubation and liberation from mechanical ventilation\nWeaning protocol was terminated after successful extubation and liberation, or insertion of a tracheostomy\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nFraction of inspired oxygen was titrated to maintain SaO2 > 90%\nActive weaning only occurred during daytime hours (8am to 10pm)\nOvernight, unless signs of distress of fatigue developed, patients were rested without ventilator setting changes\nVentilator care bundles were encouraged, which included head-up position, oral decontamination, sedation holds and peptic ulcer prophylaxis\nTracheostomy insertion was not recommended until at least after day 7 of mechanical ventilation\nCriteria for re-intubation was provided for guidance\n\nCardio-respiratory arrest\nSignificant respiratory pause\nPsychomotor agitation\nExcess respiratory secretions\nBradycardia < 50bpm or tachycardia > 140bpm\nUnresponsive haemodynamic instability\nSurgery or other procedure requiring deep sedation or anaesthesia\n\n\nOther treatments were at the bedside clinician\u2019s discretion\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: median time from randomisation to successful liberation from mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours\n\nNon-invasive group: 4.3 days\nInvasive group: 4.5 days\nAdjusted Hazard Ratio: 1.1 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.40)\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nDuration of invasive ventilation was less in the non-invasive ventilation group, demonstrating effective separation between the two groups\nTotal ventilation duration was less in the non-invasive group\nAntibiotic usage for respiratory infections was less in the non-invasive group\nTotal antibiotic duration was not different\nProportion extubated was higher in the non-invasive group\nRe-intubation rate was higher in the non-invasive group but the difference was not statistically significant\n\nRe-intubation criteria were met more frequently (regardless of whether patients were actually re-intubated) in the non-invasive group but again this difference was not statistically significant\n\n\nTracheostomy insertion was less frequent in the non-invasive group but the difference was not statistically significant\nMortality at 30, 90 and 180 day was not different\nAdverse events did not occur more frequently in either group\nQuality of life was not different between the two groups\nProcess measures demonstrated\n\nPatients in the non-invasive group were extubated earlier (as per the intervention design)\nThose requiring re-intubation in the non-invasive group were re-intubated earlier than those in the invasive group\nSedation was administered to those in the non-invasive group for fewer days\nThe patients in the non-invasive group spent fewer days in intensive care\nThe time to tracheostomy was the same in each group\n\n\nThe per-protocol, subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses demonstrated no changes in the statistical significance or conclusions\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients that failed a spontaneous breathing trial during mechanical ventilation, early extubation to non-invasive ventilation did not reduce the time to complete liberation from mechanical ventilation\n\nStrengths\n\nImportant clinical question given the burden of mechanical ventilation on patients and hospital systems\nAppropriate ethical approval and trial oversight\nWide, multi-pathology inclusion criteria, which improves generalisation to wider populations\nMulti-centre recruitment, which improves generalisation to wider populations\nRandomised and controlled, which reduces confounding biases\nAppropriate ethics approval\nTotal concealment of allocation until recruitment and randomisation, which reduces allocation bias\nProtocolised weaning and standardised extubation / re-intubation criteria to guide clinician decision-making, which reduces maintenance bias given the lack of intervention blinding\nAppropriate statistically adjusted analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes, using rate-based analyses rather than event-based analyses, which improves the power of the statistical conclusions\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUK based, which may limit the extrapolation to other healthcare models\nMajority of cases recruited from 3 sites, reducing generalisability\nUnblinded therapy, with clinicians, patients and data collectors aware of allocation, which increases the possibility and impact of maintenance, performance and detection biases\nThe protocolised, sequential weaning process may have delayed liberation from non-invasive or invasive ventilation in some patients, where clinicians felt they were ready for liberation but the protocol mandated continuation though gradual weaning\n\nThis may reduce the generalisability to non-research, real world setting\n\n\nThe differences between the non-invasive and the invasive arm may have created a difference in the primary outcome by design due to the protocolised care\n\nNon-invasive arm were weaned and liberated with two-hourly reviews but the invasive arm underwent only a daily spontaneous breathing trial\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis complex randomised, controlled trial failed to demonstrate that early extubation to non-invasive ventilation reduced the total time of mechanical ventilation\nI will continue to extubate early and will use non-invasive mechanical ventilation or high-flow nasal oxygen therapy to support patients, with regular audit of re-intubation rates\nThe beneficial secondary outcomes demonstrated in this trial, such as reduced antibiotic use, reduced sedation requirement and reduced time in intensive care warrant further investigation and may be motivators to use non-invasive ventilation more after early extubation\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of protocolized weaning with early extubation to noninvasive ventilation vs invasive weaning on time to liberation
