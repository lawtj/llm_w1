JAMA\u00a02016; 315:2694-2702. doi:10.1001/jama.2016.7201\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with acute respiratory failure, does early delivery of a standardised ICU and hospital rehabilitation programme improve physical function and reduce hospital length of stay?\n\nDesign\n\nSingle centre, assessor blind randomised study\nComputer generated variable size randomisation using blocks of 2, 4, 6 or 8\nIntention to treat analysis\nPhysical function assessed at ICU discharge, hospital discharge, and at 2, 4, and 6 months post enrolment\nQuality of life measured at hospital discharge and at 2, 4, and 6 months post enrolment\nInitial plan was to recruit 326 patients to give 80% power to detect a 30% decrease in median length of stay at a 5% 2 sided level of significance, presuming 20% in hospital mortality, an exponential LOS distribution, and a loss of 5% of patients to follow up\n\nSetting\n\nWake Forest Baptist Medical Centre, Winston, Salem, North Carolina\nOct 2009 to Nov 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdmission to medical ICU\n>18 years\nMechanical ventilation via ET tube or NIV via Mask\n\u00a0P/F ratio <300 mmHg\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nInability to walk without assistance prior to acute illness (however canes/walkers not an exclusion)\nCognitive impairment prior to ICU admission described by surrogate\nBMI >50\nNeuromuscular disease impairing weaning from mechanical ventilation\nAcute hip fracture\nUnstable C-spine or pathological fracture\nMechanically ventilated >80 hours\nCurrent hospitalisation (including transferring hospital) >7 days\nDo not intubate order on admission\nConsidered to be moribund by primary attending\nEnrolled in another research study\n\n\n4084 screened, 618 eligible, 300 randomised- recruitment stopped early due to lower than anticipated drop out rate\n\nIntervention\n\nStandardised Rehabilitation Therapy (SRT)\n\n3 exercises \u2013 passive range of motion, physical therapy (bed mobility, transfer and balance training) and progressive resistance exercises\nDone 3x/day 7 days a week\nIf patient unconscious only passive ROM done\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPhysical therapy ordered by clinical team as felt necessary. Only Monday to Friday\n\nOutcome\n\nSignificant differences seen in amounts of physical therapy delivered:\n\nIntervention group: 87% passive ROM/54.6% physical therapy/35.7% resistance exercises\nControl group: 11.7% received physical therapy\n\n\nPrimary outcome: No difference in median length of stay (both 10 days).\nSecondary outcome: No significant difference in any secondary outcomes at ICU discharge, 2 months and 4 months\n\nat 6 months, significant differences seen in :\n\nShort Performance Physical Battery (9 vs 8, P< 0.004)\nSF-36 PFS (31.1 vs 30.8; P< 0.04)\nFunctional performance Index (2.2 vs 2.0, P<0.02)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong patients hospitalised with acute respiratory failure, Standardised rehabilitation therapy compared with usual care did not decrease hospital length of stay.\n\nStrengths\n\nAn important question to ask. Weakness post ICU is increasingly recognised as a priority for patients\nRegistered with clinicaltrials.gov\nAssessors blinded to intervention\nClear separation of between intervention and control group regarding delivery of therapy\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle centre study- this limits its external validity\nVery narrow cohort of patients based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. While improving the internal validity of the trial, this again places limits on its external validity.\nThere was significant variability in patients in the intervention groups receiving treatment\u00a0\u2013\u00a013% did not receive passive ROM, 45.4% did not receive physical therapy, and 74.3% did not receive resistance exercises. While the overall \u201cdose\u201d of therapy was higher in the intervention group, the \u201ceffective dose\u201d may not have been that much more than the control.\nOther aspects of patient care were not standardised\u00a0\u2013\u00a0e.g. sedation, nutrition.\nControl group physical therapy activities not specified or standardised.\nLength of stay as an outcome measure is prone to multiple biases, and may not have detected increases in strength and balance that may have occurred.\nSignificant drop out rate over the 6 months post hospitalisation (44%)- this limits the significance of differences seen in secondary outcomes.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn this single centre study of patients with acute respiratory failure, a standardised hospital rehabilitation programme did not reduce hospital length of stay.\nHowever, this is a study with very limited external validity due to a narrow cohort in a single centre.\nEarly mobilisation may have other benefits. I will follow my unit\u2019s protocols regarding physiotherapy while awaiting a large multi-centre RCT to provide more information on the best \u201cdose\u201d and timing of physical therapy in ICU patients.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Standardised Rehabilitation And Hospital Length of Stay Amongst Patients with Acute Respiratory Failure: A Randomised Clinical Trial.\n[Editorial] The Challenging Task of Improving the Recovery of ICU Survivors.
