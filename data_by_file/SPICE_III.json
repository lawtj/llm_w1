May 19 2019. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1904710\nClinical Question\n\nIn ventilated, critically ill patients, does the use of dexmedetomidine as the primary sedative agent compared with usual sedative agents effect 90 day mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nThe ideal agent to keep patients comfortable and safe whilst ventilated in ICU is not known\nThere are several options for sedation including opioids, benzodiazepines, propofol and centrally-acting alpha-agonists such as dexmedetomidine or clonidine\nThe balance of safety and harm is always the priority in the ICU population\nPrevious studies examining dexmedetomidine have suggested shorter times to extubation and a higher number of days without coma or delirium\n\nHowever, there are limitations to these trials, including small sample sizes, underpowering to detect clinically meaningful outcomes and inconsistency with methodology\n\n\nThe MIDEX-PRODEX trial examined the feasibility of using propofol or midazolam vs dexmedetomidine to achieve desired Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) levels\nSkrobik\u2019s trial used low dose nocturnal dexmedetomidine and showed a reduced incidence of delirium\nThe DAHLIA trial supported the use of dexmedetomidine when used in delirious patients as a means of earlier liberation from the ventilator\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised Controlled Trial with 1:1 ratio\nAllocation concealment achieved via a computerised randomisation program\nModified Intention to Treat Analysis (excluding those who withdrew consent and where primary outcome was not known); all but 2.4% of patients\nUnblinded\nVariable block sized randomisation; achieves balance in the allocation of participants and the allocation is difficult to predict due to the variable block size\nStratified to site and presence of sepsis\n90% power to detect a 4.5% difference in mortality with 4000 patients (allowing a 5% loss to follow-up)\n6 prespecified subgroups\n\nSetting\n\n74 ICUs in 8 countries (Australia, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, UK)\nNovember 2013 to February 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: ICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation, expected to continue to at least the day after next and needing sedation for safety and/or comfort.\nExclusion:\n\n<18 years\nVentilation > 12 hours before enrolment\nAcute primary brain injury\n\n\n29502 patients were screened, with 4000 patients randomised, 2001 to receive dexmedetomidine and 1999 to receive usual care\n\n47 patients in the dexmedetomidine group and 35 in the usual group did not give consent, and 6 more in the dexmedetomidine group and 8 in the usual care group were lost to follow-up, leaving all but 96 (2.4%) to be analysed\n\n\nThe baseline demographics/characteristics were well matched between groups\n\nIntervention\n\nDexmedetomidine was given by continuous infusion (1\u00b5g/kg/hr) without a loading dose and adjusted as needed up to 1.5\u00b5g/kg/hr\nThe infusion was titrated to a prescribed RASS (Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale, which is between -5 for deep sedation to +4 for severe agitation)\nIf the dexmedetomidine alone did not achieve the desired level of sedation, the treating team could add other sedative agents\n\n64% of patients also received propofol (median daily dose 9.51mg/kg), 3% received midazolam and 7% received both\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPatients were given propofol, midazalam or other sedatives as prescribed by the treating team\n\nThe median daily dose of propofol was 17.9mg/kg\n\n\nDexmedetomidine use was discouraged but could be used as a rescue therapy if the other agents were ineffective\nAgitated delirium could be managed with anti-psychotics\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nRemifentanil and Clonidine use was not allowed\nOther opioids and analgesics were used at the discretion of the ICU team\nThe treatments were open label\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: There was no difference\n\n90 day mortality dexmedetomidine vs usual care;\u00a029.1% (566/1848) and 29.1% (569/1956) [95%CI, -2.9 \u2013 2.8, p = 0.98]\n\n\nSecondary outcome: There was no difference\n\nDexmedetomidine vs usual care\n\nDeath at 180 days 31.5% vs 31.3%\nInstitutional dependency at 180 days 6.7% vs 7%\nIQCODE (assessment of cognitive decline) 3.14 vs 3.08\nEQ-5D-3L (assessment of Quality of Life) 69.8 vs 70.2\n\n\nThere was a difference in\n\nMedian days free from coma to day 28; 24 vs 23 (adjusted risk difference 1.0, 95% CI 0.5-1.5)\nMedian ventilator free days at day 28; 23 vs 22\u00a0(adjusted risk difference 1.0, 95% CI 0.4-1.6)\n\n\n\n\nAdverse Outcomes\n\nDexmedetomidine vs usual care\n\nBradycardia 5.1% vs 0.5%\nHypotension 2.7% vs 0.5% (the trial did not examine differences in vasopressor uses between groups)\nAsystole 14/1954 (0.7%) vs 2/1964 (0.1%) and 7 cardiac massage events in dexmedetomidine group\n\n\n\n\nSubgroup analysis;\u00a0prespecified subgroups were age (above or below median), APACHE II (above or below median), geographic region, PaO2:FiO2 (above or below median), sepsis, admission type (operative or non-operative)\n\nThe subgroup did not impact the result although there was a divergence in effect observed only for age with more advanced years slightly favouring the dexmedetomidine group (-4.4 [95% CI\u00a0-8.7 to -0.1])\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe use of dexmedetomidine as the primary or sole sedative in ventilated ICU patients did not result in lower 90-day mortality\n\nStrengths\n\nExcellent internal and external validity\nThe authors have posed a very important question, one that impacts so many of our ICU patients and has been poorly studied previously\nThe trial carefully examined adverse effects of dexmedetomidine and highlighted the increased incidence of bradycardia, hypotension and asystole\nImportant secondary outcomes such as ventilator-free days and delirium were examined\n\nWeaknesses\n\nI am curious about the primary outcome \u2013 it would seem biologically implausible that the use of dexmedetomidine could possibly reduce day-90 death by 4.4%\n\nWhilst it\u2019s important to study clinically meaningful outcomes, trial design needs to be careful so that we don\u2019t miss a signal of benefit by searching for the impossible\n\n\n11.5% of patients in the usual care group received dexmedetomidine which may have diluted the final result\nThe dexmedetomidine group did have one less day on the ventilator and one less day with delirium and coma but these results were unadjusted for multiple comparisons\nDexmedetomidine is more expensive than the usual care sedatives\n\nFor example, it would cost around AUS$500/day to keep an 80kg person asleep with this in my unit\nThis is an important consideration for ICU resource use\nThe trial does not examine the economic impact of using dexmedetomidine\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI would not use dexmedetomidine as my sole or primary sedative agent in ventilated ICU patients\nI would consider using it in agitated or delirious patients as a means to wean usual sedation and liberate these patients sooner from the ventilator and reduce the duration of delirium\nI will be very mindful of the adverse effects of dexmedetomidine and wean or stop it if patients are becoming bradycardic with the hope to avoid asystoles\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] SPICE III\n[further reading] DAHLIA\n[further reading] Skrobik\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford\nSummary date: May 22 2019\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
