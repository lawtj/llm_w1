JAMA 2021; Published online November 30, 2021. doi:10.1001/jama.2021.20929\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, does the administration of calcium compared with placebo, improve sustained return of spontaneous circulation?\n\nBackground\n\nCalcium has an important role in myocardial contractility. It has both inotropic and vasopressor effects. In critically ill patients a direct relationship between ionised calcium levels and blood pressure has been shown\nSmall RCTs in 1985 investigating the use of calcium in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest reported improved point estimates with the use of calcium, although these results were not significant\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n\nVariable block sizes (2,4,6) in a 1:1 ratio\nRandom number generator used\nStratified according to mobile emergency care unit stations\n\n\nDouble blinded\nPlacebo-controlled\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\nSample size calculation:\n\nOriginally calculated at 430 patients\n\nThis was updated following blinded review of 1st 270 randomised patients which showed rates of return of spontaneous circulation were lower than anticipated\n\n\nUpdated sample size calculation:\n\n674 patients would give 80% power to detect an absolute improvement of 9% in the primary outcome from a baseline of 18%, with a false positive rate of 5%\n\n\n\n\nTrial stopped early on recommendation of safety monitoring committee following planned interim analysis\nModified intention to treat analysis (only included patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and met inclusion/exclusion criteria)\n\nSetting\n\nPre-hospital services in central Denmark\nPatients randomised from Jan 2020 \u2013 April 2021\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n\u226518 years\nOut of hospital cardiac arrest\nReceived at least 1 dose of adrenaline\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nTraumatic cardiac arrest (including drowning and external asphyxia)\nKnown/suspected pregnancy\nReceived adrenaline during cardiac arrest before arrival of prehospital personnel with the study drug\nClinical indication for calcium administration\n\n\n397 patients randomised out of 1221 patients with OOH cardiac arrest\n\nA majority of those excluded (578/824) did not meet inclusion criteria\n197 randomised to receive calcium chloride, 200 randomised to receive sodium chloride\n\n6 randomised patients excluded from analysis as had exclusion criteria (all traumatic cardiac arrests)\n\n\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention (calcium) vs. control (saline) group\n\nAge: 67 vs 69\nMale: 68% vs 74%\nCo-morbidity\n\nPulmonary disease: 25% vs 28%\nCoronary artery disease: 24% vs 23%\nKidney disease: 18% vs 22%\nChronic heart failure: 17% vs 18%\n\n\nCardiac arrest characteristics\n\nLocation \u2013 home: 83% vs 80%\nWitnessed: 61% vs 57%\n\nBystander CPR: 82% vs 89%\nAutomated external defibrillator shock: 8% vs 7%\n\n\n\n\nInitial cardiac rhythm\n\nAsystole: 53% vs 48%\nPEA: 24% vs 25%\nVF/VT: 22% vs 27%\n\n\nAdministration and drug characteristics\n\nIV: 40% vs 40%\nIO: 60% vs 50%\nTime to administration\n\nAdrenaline: 17 vs 17 min\nTrial drug: 17 vs 18 min\n\n\nNumber of doses of trial drug administered\n\n1: 27% vs 27%\n2: 73% vs 73%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nCalcium\n\n5mmol (10ml ampoule) of calcium chloride administered IV or IO immediately after the 1st dose of adrenaline and again following the 2nd dose of adrenaline if needed\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNormal saline\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAn ambulance and a physician manned mobile emergency medical service respond to all cardiac arrests, and almost all patients with sustained return of spontaneous circulation or ongoing CPR are transported to a single tertiary centre that is capable of PCI and ECMO\nTreatment during and post-arrest generally adheres to standard European guidelines. ~90% of patients who survived at least 24 hours underwent coronary angiography and were treated with targeted temperature management\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Sustained return of spontaneous circulation (defined as palpable pulses or other signs of circulation without a need for chest compressions for > 20 minutes) \u2013 no significant difference\n\n19% in calcium group vs 27% in placebo group\n\nRisk ratio: 0.72 [95% CI, 0.49-1.03], P\u2009=\u2009.09\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nComparing intervention vs. control group\n\nNo significant difference in\n\nSurvival at 30 days\n\n5.2% vs 9.1%\nRisk ratio: 0.57 [95% CI, 0.27-1.18], P\u2009=\u2009.17\n\n\nSurvival at 30 days with a favourable neurological outcome\n\n3.6% vs 7.6%\nRisk ratio: 0.48 [95% CI, 0.20-1.12], P\u2009=\u2009.12\n\n\nSurvival at 90 days\n\n5.2% vs 9.1%\nRisk ratio: 0.57 [95% CI, 0.27-1.18)\n\n\n\n\nSignificantly less in calcium group\n\nSurvival at 90 days with a good neurological outcome\n\n3.6% vs 9.1%\nRisk ratio: 0.40 [95% CI, 0.17-0.91)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTertiary outcomes:\n\n1st ionised calcium after ROSC \u2013 significantly higher in calcium group\n\n1.41 vs 1.17 mmol/l\n\n\n\n\nBayesian analysis\n\nThe probability that calcium has a positive effect (RR > 1) on the primary outcome is 4%\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, treatment with calcium, compared with saline, did not significantly improve sustained return of spontaneous circulation\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nBlinded\nBalanced trial groups (baseline characteristics, intra-arrest and post arrest interventions)\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\nNo loss to follow up\n\nWeaknesses\n\nTrial stopped early and did not reach pre-planned sample size\nPatients received study drug at a median of 17 minutes following cardiac arrest\n\nThis may not be generalisable to the in-hospital setting\n\nIn the VAM-IHCA trial drugs were administered in ~8-9 minutes\n\n\n\n\nRegional trial in a single country with a pre-hospital set-up that not all areas have, with a physician manned mobile emergency care unit attending all cardiac arrests\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, treatment with calcium compared with saline, at a median of 17 minutes post cardiac arrest, did not significantly improve sustained return of spontaneous circulation.\nThe point estimates suggest clinically significant harm from the use of calcium in this population\n\nExternal Links\n\nEffect of Intravenous or
