JAMA Internal Medicine; Published online August 5 2019. doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2019.2431\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) on direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) medications, does a standard approach to therapy interruption and resumption in the perioperative period result in an acceptable risk for bleeding and thromboembolic events?\n\nBackground\n\nThe perioperative management of DOAC medications in patients with AF undergoing surgery varies widely in clinical practice\nThere is a balance between avoiding thromboembolic complications of AF and bleeding due to the surgery\nIt is estimated that 6 million patients worldwide with AF on DOACs will have surgery each year\nThe rate of 30 day bleeding and thromboembolism events is known with warfarin interruption and resumption, so this was the comparator in this study\n\nDesign\n\nA prospective cohort study: the PAUSE study (Perioperative Anticoagulation Use for Surgery Evaluation)\nIt was not felt to be ethical to conduct a randomised controlled study. For example, a trial with longer periods off the DOACs did not make sense from a pharmacological perspective and would expose the patient to excess risk\nThe cohort design is a good technique to assess an outcome when the rates of the clinical outcomes are low\nSurgery was assessed as having a low bleeding or high bleeding risk\nThe timing of the interruption of the DOAC dosing prior to surgery was determined by the bleeding risk and in the case of Dabigatran, whether the patient had renal impairment\nThe timing of the resumption of the DOAC dosing after surgery was determined by the bleeding risk\nThe sample size of 987 per DOAC group provided 80% power at 0.05 significance to detect a rate of major bleeding <2% and rate of arterial thromboembolic <1.5%\n\nSetting\n\n23 clinical centres in Canada, USA and Europe enrolled patients\nEnrolment dates: August 1 2014-July 31 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Patients on DOAC for AF having elective surgery\nExclusion: Impaired renal function: CrCl<25ml/min for apixaban, <30ml/min for Dabigatran users, cognitive impairment, psychiatric illness, those who did not consent, previous study participation\n3007 patients for the primary analysis: 1257 apixiban, 1082 rivaroxaban, 668 Dabigatran. Baseline mean CHADS2-VA2Scb score and HAS-BLED scores were similar between the DOAC groups and similar to population-based studies in patients with AF\nApproximately 1/3 of patients were classified as having high bleeding risk surgery, 2/3 as low bleeding risk surgery\n87% adhered to protocol and were analysed in the secondary analysis (as far as adhering to preoperative interruption and postoperative resumption)\nLow Bleeding Risk surgery\n\nGastrointestinal procedure (eg colonoscopy)\nCardiac procedure (eg PPM insertion)\nDental procedure (eg tooth extraction)\nSkin procedure (eg skin biopsy)\nEye procedure (eg cataract surgery)\n\n\nHigh Bleeding Risk surgery: there was some flexibility with resumption of DOAC\n\nAny surgery with neuraxial anaesthesia (eg epidural)\nMajor intracranial/neuraxial surgery (eg brain cancer resection)\nMajor thoracic (eg pneumonectomy), vascular (eg CEA), abdominopelvic (eg pancreatic cancer resection), orthopaedic (eg knee arthroplasty), cardiac surgery (eg CAGs)\nOther major cancer or reconstructive surgery\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nThe DOAC was interrupted 1 day before low bleeding risk surgery and 2 days before high bleeding risk surgery (Dabigatran earlier if renal impairment)\nThe DOAC was resumed 1 day after low bleeding risk surgery and 2-3 days after high bleeding risk surgery\nPatients at high risk for venous thromboembolism could receive a prophylactic dose of heparin after the operation until DOAC therapy resumption\nThe patients\u00a0did not\u00a0receive any bridging anticoagulation\n\n\nControl\n\nThere was no control group in this observational cohort study\nPeriprocedural bleeding and thromboembolic events have previously been studied in patients who have interrupted warfarin for surgical procedures and these figures were used as a comparator. This allowed calculation of the sample size\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcomes: Major bleeding and arterial thromboembolic complication (CVA, TIA, systemic embolisation) \u2013 assessed from the time of interruption of DOAC until Day 30 after the operation\n\nMajor Bleeding Rates at Day 30:\n\nApixaban 1.35% (95% CI 0-2%)\nDabigatran 0.9% (95% CI 0-1.73%)\nRivaroxaban 1.85% (95% CI 0-2.65%)\nAll major bleeding occurred post-operatively with median time being 2 days\nIn the high bleeding risk group, rates of bleeding were \u00a02.96% (apixaban), 0.88% (Dabigatran), 2.95% (rivaroxaban)\n\n\nArterial thromboembolism\n\nApixaban 0.16% (95% CI 0-0.48%)\nDabigatran 0.6% (95% CI 0-1.33%)\nRivaroxaban 0.37% (95% CI 0-0.82%)\n9 of 10 thromboembolic events occurred post-operatively with median time 2 days\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nClinically relevant non major bleeding: 2%\nDeath 0.3%\nMyocardial infarction: 0.03%\nDVT: 0.1%\nPE: 0.2%\nCatheter associated thrombosis: 0.07% (both arterial)\n\n\nMajor bleeding in patients adhering strictly to the interruption and resumption of the DOAC as per protocol\n\nApixiban 1.2%, Dabigatran 1.0%, Rivaroxaban 1.69%\n\n\nArterial thromboembolism in patients adhering strictly to the interruption and resumption of the DOAC as per protocol\n\nApixiban 0.19%, Dabigatran 0.5%, Rivaroxaban 0.42%\n\n\nResidual anticoagulant level just before the procedure (anti-factor Xa assays for apixaban and rivaroxaban and dilute thrombin time for Dabigatran): The proportion with a level < 50ng/ml was 90.5% apixaban group, 95.1% Dabigatran, 96.8% rivaroxaban group\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nA simple standard protocol for interruption and resumption of DOACs before and after elective surgery seems to result in low rates of major bleeding and thromboembolism\n\nStrengths\n\nThe risk factor for thromboembolism in this cohort as measured by CHADS2-VA2Scb was similar to that in patients with AF in population based studies.\nThe detection of thromboembolism and bleeding was measured out to 30 days which would be ample time to detect a complication\nThe prospective cohort design is a useful study design to pick up events which are relatively rare\nAssessors of the outcomes were not aware of which DOAC the patient was on, what was the risk of bleeding from the procedure and the preoperative residual DOAC level\n\nWeaknesses\n\nA cohort study may introduce selection bias. In this study 83% of patients screened were included in the study. Those who were excluded mainly did not provide consent. There may have been a reason for that this is not apparent, eg previous bleeding after surgery, which meant the patient was unwilling to consent\nFollowup occurred by scheduled weekly telephone call and additional clinic visits as required. It is possible that outcomes could be missed with this approach\nWere the study patients similar to the patients in my practice? In the ICU setting patients are generally there for surgeries that would be classified as high bleeding risk. In this paper only a third of patients included were high bleeding risk surgeries, with the majority of these being cardiac surgeries. Only 47 patients (of the total cohort) had neurosurgery for instance. I would not confidently be able to apply these results to this group of high risk patient\nThe authors have not provided information on baseline risk, ie what is the risk of having major bleeding after these surgeries in patients who are not on DOACs. Therefore it is difficult to assess the incremental risk for the patients who resume these agents in the post-operative situation\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study reassures me that stopping DOACs for 1 day prior to surgery and resuming 1-3 days after surgery is safe in most patients\nHowever, in ICU patients, I would apply extra caution and there is still a lack of evidence in this group\n\nThis cohort study does not help this decision making in my patient group\n\n\nI am happy that DOACs can safely be stopped 1 day prior to surgery without bridging heparin\nI will continue to liaise with surgical colleagues and use other clinical factors to decide when DOACs should be resumed after surgery\n\nExternal Links\n\nPerioperative Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Receiving a Direct Oral Anticoagulant\nJAMA evidence: user guides to medical literature.
