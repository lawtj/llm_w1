NEJM 2016; April 4:online. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1514204\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF)\u00a0or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (pVT), does amiodarone or lidocaine\u00a0along with standard care result in improved survival and more favourable neurological outcome compared with placebo?\n\nDesign\n\nDouble-blind, randomized control trial\nMulti-center\nRandomization was performed in permuted blocks of concealed size and was stratified to site and Emergency Medical Service (EMS) agency\nSample size 3026; Amiodarone (974), Lidocaine (993), Placebo (1059)\nPrimary analysis included only those randomly assigned who actually met all eligibility criteria and had an initial (rather than secondary) rhythm of VF of pulseless VT (per-protocol population)\nIntention to treat analysis in all randomly assigned patients (included those with secondary rhythm of VF or pVT)\n90% power to detect an absolute difference of 6.3 percentage point difference in survival to hospital discharge between the amiodarone group and the placebo group\nInterim reviews were conducted twice/year with formal stopping boundaries\n\nSetting\n\n55 EMS agencies at 10 North American sites\nMay 7 2012 \u2013 October 25 2105\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: adult patients with non-traumatic cardiac arrest and shock-refractory VF or pVT with intravenous or intraosseus access\n\nshock-refractory was defined as persistent or recurrent VF or pVT after one or more shocks anytime during resuscitation\n\n\nExclusion: patients who had already received open-label lidocaine or amiodarone during the resuscitation or who had a hypersensitivity to these drugs\n4653 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. This was reduced to 3026 for the per-protocol population analysis\nThe baseline characteristics of each group were well matched\nPrespecified subgroups were:\n\nWitnessed arrest, bystander CPR, location, time to drug, route of drug, continuous or interrupted chest compressions, survival at the site and EMS drug-administration practice\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nTrial drugs were packaged in identically appearing sealed kits each having 3 identically formulated syringes\n\nEach syringe held 3ml of colourless fluid containing\n\nAmiodarone 3 x 150mg OR\nLidocaine 3 x 60mg OR\n0.9% sodium chloride\n\n\n\n\nThe initial dose of the drug consisted of 2 syringes as a bolus (or 1 syringe if body\u00a0weight estimated to be <45kg). If VF or pVT persisted another syringe was delivered\n\nControl\n\n0.9% sodium chloride\n\nIn Both Groups\n\nStandard Advanced Life Support algorithm\nPost-cardiac arrest care in accordance with the 2008\u00a0ILCOR Consensus Statement was encouraged\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Survival to hospital discharge\n\nAmiodarone group (24.4%), Lidocaine group (23.7%), Placebo (21%).\nAbsolute risk difference:\n\namiodarone vs placebo 3.2% (95%CI -0.4 to 7.0) P=0.08\nlidocaine vs placebo 2.6% (95% CI -1.0 to 6.3) P=0.16\namiodarone vs Lidocaine 0.7% (95% CI -3.2 to 4.7) P=0.70\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome: Survival with favourable neurological outcome at hospital discharge were similar in all groups (amiodarone 18.8%, lidocaine 17.5%, placebo 16.6%)\nSubgroup analysis:\n\nIn patients with a witnessed arrest, survival to discharge was higher in the intervention group\n\nby-stander witnessed arrest: 27.7% (amiodarone) vs 27.8% (lidocaine) vs 22.7% (placebo)\nabsolute risk difference:\n\namiodarone vs placebo: 5% (95% CI 0.3 \u2013 9.7) P=0.04\nlidocaine vs placebo: 5.2% (95% CI 0.5 \u2013 9.9) P=0.03\nno statistical difference between amiodarone and lidocaine\n\n\nEMS witnessed arrest: 38.6% (amiodarone) vs 23.3% (lidocaine) vs 16.7% (placebo)\nabsolute risk difference of 21.9% favouring amiodarone over placebo (95% CI 5.8 \u2013 38.0) P=0.01\n\nno statistical difference between lidocaine and placebo\n\n\n\n\nIn patients with an unwitnessed arrest, survival did not differ between trial groups\nPatients receiving placebo were more likely to receive the additional dose of the trial drug (P=<0.01), more shocks (P=<0.01)\u00a0and other rhythm-control medications and less likely to survive to hospital admission (P=0.01)\nPatients receiving amiodarone or lignocaine were less likely to require further CPR in hospital\n\n\nAdverse events: patients receiving amiodarone were more likely to require temporary pacing in the first 24 hours (4.9% vs lidocaine 3.2% vs placebo 2.7% P=0.02)\nIn the intention-to-treat analysis there was no difference in outcomes between the groups\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nNeither amiodarone nor lidocaine increased survival or good neurological outcome compared with placebo in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest\n\nStrengths\n\nRCT\nMulticentre\nClinically meaningful outcome\nAllocation concealment and double blinding\n\npatients, investigators and trial personnel were unaware of the trial-drug assignment\ndrugs were indistinguishable in identical syringes\n\n\n\n\nDrugs were tested regularly for stability\nNear complete follow-up\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe trial may well be underpowered to detect a statistically significant result. A 9000 patient trial would be needed to establish if a 3 percentage point difference\u00a0as a true effect of amiodarone. If this was confirmed, there would be 1800 more survivors in North America each year\nIt would be interesting to know if the neurological outcome at discharge was\u00a0better in the \u2018witnessed\u2019 OHCA group that received amiodarone or did it just increase the number of \u2018bad survivors\u2019 in this subgroup?\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAmiodarone was not shown to have a statistically significant benefit over placebo in refractory VF/pVT in OHCA. However, the 3% difference in survival to discharge may well be clinically important\nAmiodarone and lidocaine were superior in the witnessed out of hospital cardiac arrest group although caution should be taken with this sub-group analysis\nMore patients who received amiodarone required temporary pacing (amiodarone 4.9%, lidocaine 3.2%, placebo 2.7% P=0.02)\nThis trial should not change current arrest protocols and amiodarone should continue to be used for VF/pVT in OHCA\n\nExternal Links\n\n[abstract] Amiodarone, Lidocaine, or Placebo in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest \n[podcast] Nielsen on Targeted Temperature Management after Cardiac Arrest.
