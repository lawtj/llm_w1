Lancet Respir Med 2021, Published online September 1 2021, https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(21)00331-3\nClinical Question\n\nIn hospitalised adult patient with COVID-19, does baricitinib compared with placebo decrease a composite outcome of progression of illness and mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nSince January 2020, more than 4.5 million people have lost their lives to COVID-19\nVaccination is the mainstay in preventing deaths from COVID-19\nIn-hospital treatments that reduce mortality include dexamethasone as demonstrated in the RECOVERY:COVID-19 Dexamethasone trial. Tociluzimab , (and other IL-6 inhibitors) likely improve survival in critically ill patients if given concomitantly with dexamethasone. The jury is out as to whether Remdesivir improves outcomes in the critically ill\nBaricitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK1/2) inhibitor, traditionally used in auto-immune diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is known to have anti-cytokine properties and a potential anti-viral mechanism\nBarictinib was studied in combination with Remdesivir in the ACTT-2 study. This demonstrated a reduction in time to recovery compared with patients receiving Remdesivir alone. It was not powered to detect a mortality difference\n\nDesign\n\nCOV-BARRIER was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3 trial\nRandomisation occurred by a computer-generated random sequence to ensure allocation concealment\nStratification was according to the NIAID-OS (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Ordinal Scale)\n\n\n\nPatients were included if they had a NIAID-OS of 4 (hospitalised, no supplemental O2 \u2013 requiring ongoing medical care), 5 (hospitalised requiring supplemental O2) or 6 (hospitalised, on non-invasive ventilation or HFNO) Table 1 COV-BARRIER NIAID COV-BARRIER NIAID. After October 2020 only patients with NIAID-OS of 5 or 6 were included\nStratification also occurred for region and use of corticosteroid (low dose dexamethasone allowed)\nParticipants, study staff and investigators were blind to the study assignment. The interventions were packaged in identical bottles containing either baricitinib or matched placebo\nAn interim analysis was performed by an independent data monitoring committee, which assessed safety, efficacy and futility\nAdverse events were monitored by a blinded safety committee. Baricitinib has been reported to cause venous thromboembolism and predispose to secondary infections, so these events were a particular focus for the safety committee\nThe sample size was originally calculated at 400, but during the study increased (before un-masking) to 1400 based on information available from other studies. With 1400 patients the study had 81% power to detect a true treatment effect size of 7\u00b75% for the primary outcome. The final number randomised was 1525\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\n\nSetting\n\n12 countries, including 101 centres in Asia, Europe, North America and South America. Brazil (22.1%), USA (21%), Mexico (18.4%) and Argentina (13.6%) had the highest proportion of participants\nPatients were enrolled from June 11, 2020, to January 15, 2021, with follow-up complete in March 2021\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Hospitalised patient with laboratory proven SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 pneumonia and had at least one elevated inflammatory marker > Upper limit of normal (CRP, D-dimer, LDH or ferritin)\n\nNIAID-OS 4, 5 or 6\nFollowing release of the results of the ACTT-2 study (October 2020), enrolment was limited to participants with NIAID-OS 5 or 6\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nReceiving mechanical ventilation with or without other organ support (NIAID-OS 7)\nOn immunosuppressants (high dose corticosteroids, anti-IL6, T-cell or B-cell targeted therapies, interferon or other JAK inhibitors)\nHad received convalescent plasma or iv immunoglobulin\nNeutropenic (<1000 cells per \u03bcL) or Lymphopenic (<200 cells per \u03bcL)\nALT or AST > 5x normal\neGFR < 30ml/min/m2 (a half dose, ie 2mg/daily was given if eGFR 30-60ml/min/m2)\nPregnant\nThought to have unsurvivable disease\n\n\nBaseline characteristics were well-matched between groups\n\nBaricitinib (n=764) vs. Control group (n=761)\n\nNIAID-OS 4: 12% vs 13%\nNIAID-OS 5: 64% vs 62%\nNIAID-OS 6: 24% vs 25%\nConcomitant remdesivir: 18% vs 19%\nConcomitant dexamethasone: 92% vs 90%\nMedian CRP: 67.5 vs 62\u00b70 mg/L\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nBaricitinib\n\n4mg daily per oral or crushed, dissolved in water and given via NGT for up to 14 days (or until hospital discharge)\nIf eGFR 30-60 ml/min/m2, 2mg daily was given instead\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nTreatment was not protocolised but was at physician discretion at each participating site\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: There was no significant difference in a composite endpoint of progression in NIAID-OS (score 6,7 or 8) by Day 28 in the baricitinib group vs the control group\n\nThis was an intention to treat analysis in\n\nPopulation 1;

It is difficult to draw firm conclusions from a subgroup analysis but given the overall trend towards benefit, in the patients with higher NIAID-OS at baseline, the results are plausible\nThe treatments were not protocolised and there may be heterogeneity across or within institutions, eg criteria for intubation. This could impact on the outcome which looked at improvement in NIAID-OS\nThe sample size changed, as did the inclusion criteria, part-way through the trial. However, this adaptation in design was entirely appropriate given the emerging evidence of treatments and the unfolding pandemic\nThe trial does not examine costs. In Australia, a 14-day course of baricitinib costs ~ AUD$1400 ($US1000). This is a similar cost to tociluzimab ($800 x 2 doses), which is often used as an alternative agent to baricitinib (although tociluzimab\u2019s use remains controversial). In addition, baricitinib is currently readily available in my practice but tociluzimab is in short supply. The cost, although not excessive, may present a barrier to use in low and middle income nations (although for now, Eli Lilly will donate stock to these countries)\nThe ideal dose and duration of baricitinib is not known as there have not been comparative dose seeking trials in this cohort\nIt is not known if baricitinib should be used instead of tociluzimab or in conjunction with it. Hopefully, there will be more research to address this question.\nThe impact on mortality of patients with baseline NIAID-OS 7 (ie ventilated +/- receiving some other type of organ support) is not clear from this trial, however, further research is planned\nThe trial was funded by Eli Lilly pharmaceutical company, who provided research grants to some of the investigators, and some of the investigators served as an advisory board member for Eli Lilly\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial encourages me to continue using baricitinib in my ICU patients with COVID-19: it looks to be safe and effective\nThe overall reduction in mortality at day 28 and day 60 is really exciting AND seems to be of particular benefit in those who are sicker at baseline\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Paper] COV_BARRIER Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0ACTT-2 trial\n[further reading] PulmCrit Blog\n[further reading] rebelem.com:COV-BARRIER\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford @celiabradford\nSummary date: 6th September 2021\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\nImage by Nick Fewings on Unsplash\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
