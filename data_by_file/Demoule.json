Intensive care medicine. 2016 Nov 1;42(11):1723-32. doi:10.1007/s00134-016-4447-8\nClinical Question\n\nIn intubated patients recovering from acute respiratory failure, does neurally adjusted ventilator assist mode (NAVA) compared to pressure support mode, (PSV) lead to fewer patients returning to assist-control ventilation?\n\nBackground\n\nAs patients become more stable, it is common practice to move from assist-control ventilation modes\u00a0to partial-support ventilation modes\n\nAssist-control ventilation: VCV by Maquet, S-CMV by Hamilton or IPPV by Drager\nPartial-support ventilation: SIMV, PSV or CPAP-ASB by Drager\n\n\nNewer adaptive ventilation modes are becoming available, which may improve patient comfort and reduce the duration of ventilation\n\nAdaptive-support ventilation: Adaptive Support Ventilation by Hamilton, NAVA by Maquet or Proportional Pressure Support by Drager\n\n\nPrior to this trial, NAVA had been tested in small, single centre studies only\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nMulti-centre\nBlock randomisation, stratified by center\nAllocation concealment was achieved by sequentially numbered sealed, opaque, envelopes\nPhysicians not blinded but all analyses done blindly\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nSample size calculation was based on the assumption that 78% of patients will remain in partial ventilator support in the PSV group during the first 48 h\n\nAllowing for an estimated 10% failure of ventilator data collection, a sample size of 128 patients would provide 80% power at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 to detect a 17% absolute difference in primary outcome between NAVA group and PSV group\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n11 ICUs in France comprising 6 medical ICUs, 4 medical-surgical ICUs and 1 surgical ICU\nApril 2012 to June 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\u00a0Patients receiving endotracheal mechanical ventilation for more than 24 h for acute respiratory failure including de novo hypoxaemic respiratory failure, acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema or acute-on-chronic respiratory failure meeting the following criteria:\n\nAbility to sustain PSV for at least 30 min with inspiratory pressure below 30 cmH2O\nEstimated remaining duration of mechanical ventilation > 48\nLevel of sedation at most 4 on the Ramsay scale in absence of medical decision to increase the level of sedation\nFraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at most 50 % with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) no greater than 8 cmH2O\nNot on high-dose vasopressor therapy defined as norepinephrine above 0.3 \u03bcg/kg/min or dopamine above 10 \u03bcg/kg/min\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nAge < 18 years\nKnown pregnancy\nParticipation in another trial within the 30 days preceding completion of the eligibility criteria\nContraindication to placement of the NAVA oesophageal tube (i.e. any contraindication to placement of a gastric tube or repositioning of a tube already in place, recent gastrointestinal suture, rupture of oesophageal varices with gastrointestinal bleeding during the 4 days prior to inclusion)\nDecision to withhold life-sustaining treatment\n\n\n3896 screened, 128 randomised, primary outcome available for 118 patients\n\nLost to follow-up 7.8%\n\n\nBaseline characteristics\n\nEvenly matched in terms of age, SAPS2 score, duration of mechanical ventilation prior to inclusion and cause of respiratory failure\nSignificant baseline differences in terms of gender distribution (more males in NAVA group) and Charlson score (higher degree of comorbidity in PSV group)\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nNAVA \u2013 Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist\n\n\u00a0FiO2 and PEEP were defined by treating clinicians according to local guidelines\nNAVA levels were set to obtain a tidal volume of 6-8ml/kg idea body weight\nContinued for 14 days unless patient met criteria for switch to controlled mechanical ventilation or met criteria for weaning and extubation\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPSV \u2013 Pressure Support Ventilation\n\nFiO2 and PEEP were defined by treating clinicians according to local guidelines\nPressure support levels were set to obtain a tidal volume of 6-8ml/kg idea body weight\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nEAdi nasogastric catheters were placed in all patients prior to randomisation\n\nEAdi monitoring data were available to clinicians for patients in both groups\n\n\nCriteria for switching to assist-control mechanical ventilation (i.e. failing partial-support ventilation)\n\nRespiratory distress, hypoxaemia or hypercapnic acidosis despite optimisation of ventilator settings\nSevere hypotension, shock or arrhythmias\nIncreased need for sedation for\n\nAgitation\nPatient\u2013ventilatory asynchrony\nInvestigation or procedure\n\n\n\n\nIf criteria for partial-support ventilation were restored, patients remained in the same allocated treatment arm and NAVA or PSV were re-instituted\nPatients were screened for weaning and extubation daily\n\nIf the following criteria were met, a spontaneous breathing trial (up to 1 hour on T-piece or PSV 7 cmH2O with zero PEEP) was conducted and patients were extubated if this was successful\n\nImprovement in the causative pathology\nSpO2 > 92% on FiO2 < 50% and PEEP < 5 cmH20\nNo vasopressor or sedation requirement\nResponse to simple commands\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\u00a0Proportion of patients who remained continuously in partial ventilator support mode (either NAVA or PSV) during first 48 hours following inclusion or until extubation without any return to assist-control mode was not different between the groups\n\n67.2% (in NAVA group) vs 63.3% (in PSV group)\nRelative risk reduction of 1.19 (95 % CI 0.56\u20132.54; P = 0.66)\nAbsolute risk reduction: 3.91% (95% CI\u00a0-13.26% to 21.07%, P = 0.70)\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nPatient-Ventilator asynchrony measured by asynchrony index\n\n14.7% (12.3-21.7) in NAVA group vs 26.7% (15.8-45.1) in PSV group\nP <0.001\n\n\nDyspnea on day 1 as reported by patients\n\n28% in NAVA group vs 66% in PSV group\nP=0.03\n\n\nDyspnea at 48 hours as reported by patients\n\n50% in NAVA group vs 52% in PSV group\nP=0.54\n\n\nUse of post-extubation non-invasive ventilation\n\n43.5% in NAVA group vs 66.6% in PSV group\nP=0.008\n\n\nInvasive Ventilator free days at day 7\n\n3 (0-4) in NAVA group vs 3 (0-4) in PSV group\nP=0.87\n\n\nInvasive Ventilator free days at day 14\n\n10 (2.5-11) in NAVA group vs 9 (4.8-11) in PSV group\nP =0.91\n\n\nInvasive ventilator free days at day 28\n\n24 (10.5-25) in NAVA group vs 23 (13.8-25) in PSV group\nP=0.76\n\n\nDeath in first 28 days\n\n14.5% in NAVA group vs 22.7% in PSV group\nP=0.25\n\n\nDays of ICU stay\n\n18 (13.5-32) in NAVA group vs 18 (12-26) in PSV group\nP=0.48\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nNAVA does not increase the probability of remaining in a partial ventilator mode but decreases patient-ventilator asynchrony and is associated with less frequent application of non-invasive mechanical ventilation post-extubation\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nMulti-centre\nIntention to treat Analysis\nBlinded statistical analysis\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe primary outcome chosen is not a very patient-important outcome\nAlthough there was significant difference in use of post-extubation non-invasive ventilation, there were no clearly defined guidelines regarding use of post-extubation NIV\nIt was left to the discretion of the physicians who were not blinded\nAlthough there was significant difference in asynchrony\u00a0index between the two groups, data for calculating asynchrony\u00a0index was missing in 14.5% of NAVA group and 24.2% of PSV group\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis randomised controlled multi-centre trial failed to demonstrate that NAVA can increase the probability of remaining in a partial ventilator mode in intubated patients recovering from acute respiratory failure\nNAVA was noted to decrease patient-ventilator asynchrony and was associated with less frequent application of non-invasive mechanical ventilation post-extubation\nHowever, some of the methodical flaws limit the internal validity of the positive findings\nNAVA does not seem to have an advantage over PSV when it comes to patient-significant outcomes such as ventilator free days, length of ICU or hospital stay, mortality etc.\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist as an alternative
