The Lancet; published online February 20, 2017 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30057-0\nClinical Question\n\nIn high-risk patients\u00a0receiving contrast medium, does prophylactic hydration with normal saline compared to no prophylaxis impact the rate of contrast-induced nephropathy?\n\nDesign\n\nProspective non-inferiority trial\nRandomised 1:1 assignment\nComputer generated randomisation\nMinimisation stratification to assist allocation concealment and balance subgroups\nBlinding of laboratory staff processing creatinine samples but not of patients or clinicians administering the treatment\nInformed consent by participants\nCost-effectiveness examined\nPre-specified subgroups were analysed: Diabetes, eGFR<45 vs eGFR>45, route (IA vs IV), procedure type (interventional vs diagnostic)\n\nSetting\n\nMastricht University Medical Centre (Netherlands)\nJune 2014 \u2013 July 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAll consecutive patients aged 18 years or older, referred for an elective procedure requiring intravascular contrast material WITH EITHER\n\neGFR 45\u201360 ml/min/m2 + diabetes OR 2 of >75 years; anaemia (HCT <0.39 L/L for men, < 0.36 L/L for women); CVS disease; NSAIDs; diuretics OR\neGFR 30\u201345 ml/min/m2 OR multiple myeloma OR Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinaemia with small chain proteinuria\n\n\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nINTENSIVE CARE PATIENTS\neGFR < 30\nRRT\nemergency procedures\n\n\n328 allocated to hydration group (32 subsequently excluded as no creatinine available at day 2\u20136). 332 to no prophylactic group (25 subsequently excluded)\nBaseline characteristics evenly matched between groups\n\nIntervention\n\nHydration Group:\n\n3\u20134 ml/kg/hr of normal saline for 4 hours before and after contrast OR \n1 ml/kg/hr of normal saline for 12 hours before and after contrast\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNo hydration\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nIncidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (defined as proportion of patients with\u00a0an increase in serum creatinine by more than 25% or 44 \u00b5mol/L within 2\u20136 days of contrast exposure)\n\n2.7% (8/296 in hydration group) vs 2.6% (8/307 in no hydration group).\nDifference -0.1% (95% CI -2.25% to 2.06%; p=0.47)\n\n\nCost-effectiveness of hydration vs no hydration\n\nMean total cost \u20ac1455 vs \u20ac792\nDifference -\u20ac663 (95% CI -\u20ac1234 to -\u20ac191)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nMean change in creatinine from baseline at 2\u20136 days and 26\u201335 days\n\nMean 2\u20136 day change in Cr was 0.31 \u00b5mol/L in the hydration group and 1.3 \u00b5mol/L in the no hydration group (p=0.40)\nMean 26\u201335 day change in Cr\u00a0was 1.44 \u00b5mol/L\u00a0in the hydration group and 1.39 \u00b5mol/L in the no hydration group\n\n\nMajor adverse events: mortality, RRT, ICU admission, sequelae of fluid administration\u2026 all non-significant differences except that 4% of the hydration group developed heart failure vs 0% in the no hydration group P=0.0001\n\n\nSubgroups: no different in CIN in any of the prespecified subgroups\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nNo hydration was non-inferior to hydration in the prevention of contrast induced nephropathy. Hydration is more expensive and can cause problems in itself.\n\nStrengths\n\nAppropriate randomised, allocation concealment and blinding to minimise bias\nAt risk population tested\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSample size\u00a0reduced midway through study however unlikely to impact the validity of the results given the predefined non-inferiority margin.\nPrimary outcome a surrogate outcome and not powered to detect differences in a clinically meaningful outcomes which would need a much larger sample size.\u00a0However, protracted adverse effects of contrast administration seem very rare\u00a0so surrogate is a reasonable option.\nNot applicable to Intensive Care patients as these patients\u00a0excluded.\u00a0A trial of STEMI patients receiving contrast for coronary angiography showed a much higher incidence of CIN generally and superiority of those hydrated vs those without hydration perhaps related to haemodynamic instability, nephrotoxics and higher contrast volumes.\nSingle centre (but similar protocols used in other centres)\nSingle blinding but a robust laboratory endpoint measured\nModified intention to treat analysis (patients were excluded if creatinine unavailable on Day 2-6. These patients did not have differing baseline characteristics to the analyzed sample.)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHydration prior to contrast administration may not be necessary in all patients previously thought at risk to develop CIN.\nHowever, this trial does not specifically answer the question for my ICU patient. At this stage, intravenous hydration in this population should\u00a0continue especially if the patient has haemodynamic instability, nephrotoxic drugs and high contrast doses. Patients with GFR < 30 should still receive peri-procedure hydration.\u00a0With patients at risk of pulmonary oedema, hydration should be used judiciously.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Prophylactic hydration to protect renal function from intravascular iodinated contrast material in patients at high risk of contrast-induced nephropathy: AMACING\n[further reading]\u00a0Contrast Induced Nephropathy by LITFL\n[further reading]\u00a0Do CT scans cause contrast nephropathy? by PulmCrit (EmCrit)\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Celia Bradford\nSummary date: 5 March 2017\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
