Pediatrics 2015:136(3), doi: 10.1542/peds.2015-1385\nClinical Question\n\nDoes a neonatal intensive care team who is affected by rudeness compared to no rudeness impair team members\u2019 diagnostic and procedural performance?\n\nBackground\n\nIatrogenic events occur in ~4% of hospital admissions with half of these being preventable and 14% resulting in death. These rates are higher in patients that are critically ill\nStudies have suggested that the risk of iatrogenic events is increased by practitioner stressors. One such stressor may be rudeness\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n\nStratified by unit and hospital\nRandomisation performed by research assistant\n\u2018Randomly assigned to teams at the same time and shift of the day based on availability in the NICU\u2019\nRandomly assigned to the control or incivility group\n\n\nExperimenter and the participants were blinded to the group allocation\nParticipants performed a 1-hour simulation in their own NICU followed by a workshop on team reflexivity\n\nSimulation observed on webcam by \u2018international world expert\u2019\nManaged pre-term infant with necrotizing enterocolitis who was in respiratory failure and shock, who then went on to develop a cardiac tamponade secondary to a central line\n\n\nAssessor of performance blinded to group assignment (2 senior physicians and 1 senior nurse read written documentation and watched recorded simulation)\n\nPerformance rated on 5 point scale (1 = failed, 2 = poor, 3 = moderate, 4 = good, 5 = excellent) with descriptions and examples of indicative behaviour for each score. Diagnostic and procedural performance were assessed\n\n\nSample size calculation of 10-11 teams per condition \u2013 the power of the study was not stated\n\nSetting\n\n4 Israeli Neonatal Intensive Care Units\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nNeonatal team\n\nComprising of 1 physician and 2 nurses from the same unit\nMean occupational tenure of 10.6 +-8.6 years\n\n\nExclusion criteria: none stated\n\n\n\n\n24 teams of 3 randomised\n\nComparing intervention and control groups no significant difference in age, sex, hierarchal status, level of expertise, tenure of participants\nIntervention\n\nSubjected to rude behaviour\n\nParticipants shown pre-recorded videos that they were told were live\n\nPrior to starting simulation\n\nExpert stated that he had \u201calready observed a number of groups from other hospitals and he was not impressed by the quality of medicine in Israel\u201d\n\n\nHalf way through simulation\u00a0(at 10 minutes)\n\nExpert stated \u201cmedical staff like those observed in Israel wouldn\u2019t last a week in his unit\u201d and that he \u201choped they would learn and improve from the workshop but he hoped he would not get sick in Israel\u201d\n\n\n\n\nParticipants rated the behaviour as rude with a mean score of 3.24/4\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNot subjected to rude behaviour\n\nParticipants were shown similar videos as intervention groups but without the rude comments\nParticipants rated the behaviour as rude with a mean score of 1.21/4\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nDiagnostic performance \u2013 significantly lower in team exposed to rudeness\n\n2.65 vs. 3.18, p=0.005\n\n\nProcedural performance \u2013 significantly lower in team exposed to rudeness\n\n2.77 vs. 3.26, p=0.008\n\n\nMultivariate analysis demonstrated that~12% of the variance in medical performance was explained by rudeness\nStandardised coefficients for mediation model\n\nRudeness was significantly associated with reduced\n\nInformation sharing\n\n-0.51, 95% C.I. -0.87 to -0.15, p<0.01\n\n\nHelp-seeking\n\n-0.38, 95% C.I. -0.7 to -0.08, p<0.05\n\n\n\n\nInformation sharing had a significant positive relationship with diagnostic performance (0.47, p<0.01) but not with procedural performance\nHelp-seeking had a significant positive relationship with procedural performance (0.41, p<.01), but not diagnostic performance\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nRudeness harms the diagnostic and procedural performance of practitioners\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nBlinding of experimenter, participants and assessors\nUse of videos allowed standardised process\nModerate-to-high inter-rater reliability of judges\nGood baseline balance between groups of study participants (e.g. expertise and experience)\nIf anything, the \u2018rudeness\u2019 was relatively mild and was not personally directed (comments were generic to Israel) yet still appeared to have a detrimental effect\nThe study is underpinned by a persuasiveness conceptual framework explaining how rudeness affects performance\nTeam member assignments were random, resembling the \u201cflash teams\u201d of people that may not have previously worked together that are common in hospital emergency responses\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRandomisation process not clearly stated i.e was a computer random number generator used, or did the research assistant just pick?\nSample size calculation, demonstrating power of study, was not performed\nClinical expertise and training of judges in assessment was not specified\nIt was not stated if the assessment process has been validated\nAlthough the findings of decreased performance were clearly statistically significant, the potential clinical significance of the deterioration in performance is uncertain\nEffects seen in this simulated setting may differ from what would occur \u2018in real life\u2019\nStudy performed in a single country \u2013 staff in Israel may respond differently to rude behavior compared with staff in England\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis randomised controlled trial demonstrated that rudeness was associated with significantly reduced diagnostic and procedural performance\nRudeness was significantly associated with\n\nReduced information sharing which in turn was associated with reduced diagnostic performance\nReduced help-seeking behaviour, which in turn was associated with reduced procedural performance\n\n\nThere are limitations in the methodology of this paper, however, this is the best available evidence. We should therefore consider rudeness to be a patient safety issue and aim to minimise this behaviour\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0The impact of rudeness on medical team performance\n[further reading]\u00a0St. Emlyns Journal Club\n[further listening]\u00a0EmCrit \u2013 Rudeness: The Brindley Sessions\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 25.07.18.\nPeer-review editor: @precordialthump\u00a0(Chris Nickson)\n\n\n"
