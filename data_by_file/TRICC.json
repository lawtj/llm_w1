N Engl J Med 1999; 340:409-417.\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients admitted to ICU does a restrictive vs. liberal blood transfusion strategy alter mortality?\n\nDesign\n\nRCT, computer generated randomisation, opaque envelopes\nStratified by centre and APACHE score\nNon-blinded\n\nSetting\n\n22 tertiary and 3 community ICUs in Canada\nNovember 1994\u20137\n\nPopulation\n\n6541 adult patients were assessed of whom 838 randomised\nEuvolaemic patients\u00a0as judged by attending physician\nExpected stay in ICU >24hrs\nAcute anaemia with Hb \u22649 g/dl within 72hrs of admission\nExcluded patients with active blood loss; chronic anaemia (Hb<9 g/dl more than one month prior to admission); admission after routine cardiac surgery\n\nIntervention\n\nRestrictive strategy: Transfused when Hb<7 g/dl (target 7-9 g/dl)\n\nControl\n\nLiberal strategy: Transfused when Hb<10 g/dl (target 10-12 g/dl)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Overall 30 day mortality was similar in both groups. 18.7% in restrictive vs. 23.3% in liberal, (95% C.I. -0.84 to 10.2, P=0.11)\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nHospital mortality higher in liberal transfusion group: 22.2% in restrictive vs. 28.1% in liberal, (95% C.I. -0.3 to 11.7, P=0.05)\nMore than 3 organ failure no difference\n\n\nSubgroup analyses:\n\nMortality rate was significantly lower in the restrictive group in the following circumstances:\n\nIn the less acutely ill patients (APACHE II score \u2264 20), 30-day mortality was 8.7% vs. 16.1%, 95% C.I. for absolute difference 1-13.6%, P=0.03\nIn the patients who were < 55 years of age (5.7% vs. 13%, P=0.02)\n\n\nMortality was similar in restrictive compared with the liberal groups in patients with known cardiac disease \u00a0(20.5% vs. 22.9%, p=0.69)\nCardiac events (MI, pulmonary oedema, angina, cardiac arrest) more common in liberal (21%) vs. restrictive group (13.2%), P<0.01\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\nRestrictive strategy is at least as effective and possibly superior to liberal strategy. The conclusion was that the transfusion threshold could be less than the 9-10g/dl that had been the previous standard of practice. The authors recommended caution and perhaps a higher transfusion threshold in patients with ischaemic heart disease\n\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre\nRandomisation appropriate design and method\nAudited opaque envelopes to check none missing\nAppropriate primary outcome\nAppropriate power calculation\nIntention to treat analysis\nUse of consort style diagram\nThe average APACHE II score was 21 indicating a reasonably sick population\n33% of the restrictive group did not receive any blood, but all of the liberal group received blood, so the transfusion rate was reasonably high, making the findings more impressive. A lower hospital mortality with an average transfusion requirement difference of 2 units between the groups is a powerful challenge to the previously held belief that high haemoglobin levels are always necessary in the critically ill\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSelection bias with large number of patients not included in the trial, including 598 following physician refusal. Only 13% patients were included in the trial\nChanged subgroups post-hoc from APACHE score <15 to <20 (did they do some data dredging to get their \u2018significant\u2019 result?)\nOnly included patients with anaemia within 3 days of admission\nInadequate sample size. Study powered to rule out an absolute difference in 30-day mortality of 5.5% between treatment groups with 1620 patients. However study only randomised 838 patients therefore potential for Type 2 error\nNo subgroup analysis for patients with traumatic brain injury and it has been argued that these patients should have a higher Hb level\nNot necessarily a weakness, but worth raising, is the issue surrounding the transfusion trigger for patients with IHD. The authors recommended caution in those patients with significant cardiac disease, in particular those with acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina. This was based primarily on 2 cohort studies (Carson 1996; Hebert, TRICC & Canadian Critical Care Trial Investigators 1997) which demonstrated that increased level of anaemia in the presence of ischaemic heart disease resulted in increased mortality. Interestingly, this study does not support this finding and hypothesised whether \u2018the apparent discrepancy between our results and those of previous studies may be the result of confounding or an inability to document the negative effects of transfusion in the observational studies\u2019\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe transfusion threshold in critically ill patients can be between 7-9g/dl without adverse effects. Compared with the previously higher (>9g/dl) threshold, this results in less blood transfusion and its associated costs and potential complications. Caution has been advised in patients with evidence of active cardiac ischaemia\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf / abstract / doi:\u00a010.1056/NEJM199902113400601\nDoes transfusion practice affect mortality in critically ill patients?
