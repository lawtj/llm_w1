DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1616218\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u226435%, undergoing cardiac surgery, does levosimenden compared with placebo reduce the incidence of a composite outcome of:\n\ndeath at day 30\nrenal replacement therapy (RRT) at day 30\nperioperative myocardial infarct at day 5\nuse of mechanical assist device at day 5\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nRandomized, multicentre, double-blind, placebo control\n1:1 ratio to receive levosimendan or placebo. Web-based allocation\nPlacebo infusion appeared identical to levosimendan\nThe primary end point was determined on the modified intention to treat group and adjusted for trial group, surgery type, LVEF, age and sex\nThere was missing data for 7 patients in the levosimendan group and 11 patients in the placebo group and these were analysed as not having had an event\nSample size was based on an assumed event rate of the four-component end point of 32% in the placebo group, a 35% lower risk with levosimendan than with placebo and a significance level of 0.01. A sample size of 760 patients was calculated to provide 80% power\n\nSetting\n\n70 sites in the US and Canada\nSeptember 2014 \u2013 November 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: all patients \u226518 years, undergoing cardiac surgery (on bypass) with LVEF \u226435%. The surgery could be coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG), CABG + aortic-valve surgery, isolated mitral-valve surgery or any combination of these\nExclusion criteria included:\n\nRestrictive/obstructive cardiomyopathy, constrictive/restrictive pericarditis, pericardial tamponade\nSystemic infection\nDialysis at randomization\neGFR < 30\nWeight > 170kg\nHeart Rate > 120bpm for >10minutes\nHaemoglobin < 80g/L\nSerum potassium <3.5mmol/L or >5.5mmol/L\nHistory of Torsades de Pointes\nMechanical assist device placed pre-surgery\nPatients with femoral occlusive disease\nLiver dysfunction (Child Pugh Class B or C)\nImmune compromise, pregnancy\n\n\n882 people randomized. 442 assigned to receive levosimendan (intention to treat population)\u00a0with 428 actually receiving it (modified ITT). 440 assigned to receive placebo (ITT population) with 421 actually receiving it (modified ITT)\nBaseline characteristics were similar between the two groups with the authors noting many had multiple co-morbidities and median LVEF 27%. Isolated CABG accounted for 2/3rds of the surgical cases\n\nIntervention\n\nLevosimendan was commenced just before surgery, after the arterial line was inserted and before knife to skin. The starting dose was 0.2ug/kg/min for 1 hour then 0.1ug/kg/min for 23 hours.\n\nControl\n\nA placebo (indistinguishable from the levosimendan) was run at\u00a0the same\u00a0rate for the same duration\n\nIn Both Groups\n\nUse of other medications including vasopressors and other inotropes, was left to the treating team to prescribe as indicated\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: No statistical difference in either 4 point and 2 point composite endpoints\n\n4 point composite endpoint:\n\ndeath at day 30, RRT at day 30, perioperative myocardial infarct at day 5 (CKMB > 100ng/ml or 10x upper limit of normal),\u00a0OR use of a mechanical assist device (IABP, ECMO, VAD)\n24.5% (105 patients) in the levosimendan group and 24.5% (103 patients) in the placebo group (adjusted OR 1.0, 99% CI 0.66-1.54; P=0.98)\n\n\n2 point composite endpoint:\n\ndeath at day 30 or use of a mechanical assist device\n13.1% (56 patients) in levosimendan group and 11.4% (48 patients) in the placebo group (adjusted OR 1.18, 96% CI 0.76-1.82; P=0.45)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Outcomes:\n\nNo statistical difference in ICU length of stay; rehospitalisation at 30 days; death at 90 days; any adverse events\nFewer \u00a0patients in the\u00a0levosimendan group had a low cardiac output state (18.2% vs 25.7%) and the need for other inotropes beyond 24 hours after the initiation of the infusion (54.9% vs 62.7%)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nProphylactic levosimendan compared to placebo, in patients with reduced LVEF undergoing cardiac surgery on bypass, did not result in a lower rate of the composite endpoint of death, renal replacement therapy, infarct\u00a0OR need for a mechanical cardiac assist device\n\nStrengths\n\nRobust design with adherence to all the principles needed to ensure good internal and external validity: modified intention to treat analysis, allocation concealment, blinding and near complete follow-up\nThe composite outcome is clinically relevant\nThe sample size was increased part way through the trial when the composite event rate among the first 600 patients was found to be lower than originally anticipated.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe dose of levosimendan (particularly the loading dose) may not have been high enough to make a difference in these groups\nThere may be groups not identified in this study that may benefit from levosimendan, for example ultra-low ejection fraction patients\nThe composite end point reduces the usefulness of the results but 3000 patients would be needed to assess a mortality difference\nThis article did not outline a cost comparison. Levosimendan is expensive and with no statistical difference in outcomes, this needs to be considered\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nLevosimendan does not have any clinical outcome benefit, when used as a prophylactic agent, in patients with\u00a0poor left ventricular ejection fraction undergoing cardiac surgery on bypass\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Levosimendan in Patients with Left Ventricular Dysfunction Undergoing Cardiac Surgery\n[further reading]\u00a0Levosimendan for Hemodynamic Support after Cardiac Surgery\n[further reading]\u00a0LEOPARDS Trial; The Bottom Line review of Levosimendan in Septic Shock\n[further reading]\u00a0Effects of Levosimendan on Patients with Heart Failure Complicating Acute Coronary Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Celia Bradford\nSummary date:\u00a0March 23 2017\nPeer-review editor: Steve Mathieu\n\n\n"
