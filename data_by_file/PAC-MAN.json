The downside to this is that there was no set protocol and therefore the patients included in the trial could have been managed with a number of different strategies, some of which may have been beneficial while others harmful.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDid not assess quality of use of PAC. The authors highlight the high degree of ignorance amongst ICU staff when it come to interpreting data from a PAC\nDid not assess for late-onset complications e.g. infection\nUse of ultrasound not reported. This is likely because it was not used. If it had been used then the number of complications may have been reduced\nNot powered for subgroup analyses. I am most interested in whether or not PACs are useful for decompensated right heart failure or pulmonary hypertension. Other less invasive cardiac output monitoring devices will provide sufficient haemodynamic indices in non cardiogenic shock\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn units that practice PACs on a regular basis for critically ill patients, there was no benefit found from the use of a PAC. Complications occurred in 10%, although some of these may have been avoided with the use of ultrasound. Subgroup analysis showed no benefit in any \u2018major presumptive clinical syndrome,\u2019 however like with all studies, subgroup analyses were not sufficiently powered to give us the definite answer.\nHistorically, the majority of ICUs that took part in the study used PACs frequently. Current practice means that a number of units use PACs very infrequently, much less than 5% which was the cut-off in the study for \u2018low use of PAC\u2019. With unfamiliarity the benefits from the use of a PAC may be less and the complications may be greater.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0Assessment of the clinical effectiveness of pulmonary artery catheters in management of patients in intensive care (PAC-Man): a randomised controlled trial\n[article abstract]\u00a0Post-hoc analysis\n[Podcast]\u00a0Charming the yellow snake, Ray Rapper, ICN & SMACC\n[Commentary]\u00a0Obituary: pulmonary artery catheter 1970 to 2013, Marik\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 10.08.2014.\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n"
