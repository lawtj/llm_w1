Further trials will need to determine if these results can apply to other populations.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Inferior vena cava distensibility as a predictor of fluid responsiveness in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage\n[further listening]\u00a0EMCrit \u2013 assessing fluid responsiveness\n[further listening]\u00a0SMACC Debate \u2013 Rob MacSweeney vs Paul Marik \u2013 Predicting Fluid Responsiveness is a Waste of Time\n[further reading] LITFL fluid responsiveness\n[further listening] EMCrit \u2013 IVC Ultrasound for Fluid Tolerance in Spontaneously Breathing Patients\n[further listening] SMACC: The Dark Art of IVC Ultrasound\n[further watching] Ultrasound Podcast: IVC\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: David Slessor\nSummary date:\u00a025th October 2016\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
