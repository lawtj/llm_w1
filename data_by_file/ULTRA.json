Lancet 2021; 397:112-18. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32518-6]\nClinical Question\n\nIn adults presenting with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), does ultra early short term treatment with tranexamic acid improve clinical outcome at 6 months?\n\nBackground\n\nTranexamic acid has previously been thought to be a wonder drug in terms of bleeding, but many recent negative studies looking at effectiveness of TXA haltering bleeding at various sites, suggest that its use needs to be refined (CRASH 2, WOMAN, TICH-2 etc)\nPatients presenting with SAH are at risk of a re-bleed, which can be catastrophic; this most commonly occurs within the first 24hrs post sentinel event and it is thought that about half of these within the first 3 hours\nThose with SAH are also prone to developing delayed cerebral ischaemia which can lead to poor clinical outcome in patients; there are concerns that TXA may potentially encourage this\nSome studies have shown a trend towards TXA reducing rates of re-bleeds in SAH, however there are no high quality studies powered specifically to look at overall clinical outcome\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised\n\nComputer generated allocation\nStratified by treatment centre\n\nPermuted blocks within each centre\nRandom block sizes up to max of 12\n\n\n\n\nNon blinded, other than the assessors at 6 month follow up\n950 patients would be needed to provide an 80% power to detect an 8.1% difference in good clinical outcome (defined here as mRS 0-3), with alpha set at 0.05\nIntention to treat (ITT) analysis for analysing data but as treated (AT) and per protocol (PP) also to be done in original methodology given risk of protocol deviations etc being open label\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\n\nSetting\n\n24 sites in Netherlands (16 referring hospitals and 8 SAH treatment centres)\nData collected July 2013- July 2019\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n\u226518yrs\nAdmitted to one of the participating centres\nSymptoms less than 24 hrs\nNon contrast CT confirming SAH\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nPerimesencephalic bleeding pattern on CT AND GCS 13-15 with no loss of consciousness after onset nor focal neurological deficit on admission\nTraumatic SAH pattern on CT\nOngoing treatment for DVT/PE\nHypercoagulability disorder\nPregnancy\nCreatinine >150umol/L\nImminent death within 24hrs\n\n\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics (Tranexamic acid vs. control)\n\nFemale 69% vs 66%\nWorld Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) Grade\n\nI: 36% vs 40%\nII: 20% vs 20%\nIII: 5% vs 3%\nIV: 20% vs 20%\nV: 19% vs 17%\n\n\nFisher Grade Score\n\nII: 8% vs 4%\nIII: 26% vs 32%\nIV: 66% vs 64%\n\n\nMedication use\n\nPlatelet inhibitor: 13% vs 13 %\nAnticoagulation: 3% vs 4%\nAntihypertensives: 24% vs 23%\nNone of the above: 69% vs 69%\n\n\nLocation of aneurysm\n\nAnt. circulation: 70% vs 69%\nPost. circulation: 16% vs 16%\nNone: 14% vs 15%\n\n\nTreatment modality\n\nEndovascular: 67% vs 64%\nClipping: 21% vs 22%\nNone: 13% vs 14%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nTranexamic acid (n=480)\n\n1g bolus followed by 1g infusion every 8hrs\nContinued until start of endovascular or surgical treatment or until a max of 24 hrs ( whichever came first)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard treatment (n=475)\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nTrial was done by deferred consent given necessity of immediate treatment if enrolled into study arm\nTranexamic acid was stopped if:\n\nNo aneurysm seen after diagnostic work up ( CT angio or digital subtraction angiography)\nWhen other intracranial pathology was responsible for SAH\nWhen patients or authorised representatives declined tranexamic acid\n\n\nStandardised telephone interview at 6 months to assess modified Rankin Scale (mRS)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: (Tranexamic acid vs control)\n\nGood clinical outcome at 6months, ie mRS 0-3 \u2013 no significant difference\n\n60% vs 64% OR 0.87 ( 95% CI 0.67- 1.13);

Reduced external validity esp with variety of access globally to speedy surgical intervention\n\nThis study had a median time of surgical intervention 14hrs (IQR 5-20)\n\n\nLarge number of patients (14%) recruited had no aneursyms seen on angiography which will affect power/outcomes of study\nTrue efficacy of TXA potentially not caught by this study as median time from first signs and symptoms and TXA was 185mins (IQR 130-333)\nmRS is subjective and scored by one assessor, multiple assessors in study\n\nintrarater/inter rater reliability\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study does not show any clear clinical benefit from tranexamic acid use in SAH.\nThere may be some potential use of tranexamic acid in SAH in the future, when the patient group and timings are clearer. However, given the potential increased risk of delayed cerebral ischaemia i would not be routinely be using this in my practice\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Ultra early tranexamic acid after subarachnoid haemorrhage (ULTRA): a randomised controlled trial\n[further reading]\u00a0Post et al.
