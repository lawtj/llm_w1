JAMA. 2017;318(14):1335-1345. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.14171\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) does use of a lung recruitment maneuver associated with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration according to the best respiratory-system compliance, compared with a conventional low-PEEP strategy, decrease 28-day mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nARDS affects 10-15% of the ICU patient population. ARDS is associated with increased mortality and poor long term quality of life. Mechanical ventilation is a key element of the management of ARDS, yet can also worsen the condition through ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and some ARDS patients still progress to ventilator-refractory hypoxaemia.\nAn \u2018open lung approach\u2019 involving relatively high positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) settings and lung recruitment manoeuvres has been proposed as a means of reducing VILI (e.g. by decreasing atelectrauma) and improving oxygenation.\nRecruitment manoeuvres are designed to recruit more alveoli for gas exchange and increase the ventilated lung volume, using brief incremental increases in PEEP. In this study this was followed by down titration of PEEP to the PEEP that achieves the highest level of respiratory-system compliance (ratio of tidal volume to driving pressure), which was then set (+2 cmH2O) as the optimal PEEP\nPrevious trials have found improvements in oxygenation, respiratory-system compliance, and biomarkers of systemic inflammation, without increasing barotrauma or other adverse events. However, proof of benefit in terms of patient-orientated outcomes is lacking, despite systematic reviews of pre-existing literature suggesting improved mortality with recruitment manoeuvres and no increase in barotrauma. In general, previous studies have been flawed due to study designs with a high risk of bias and highly variable use of co-interventions in addition to high PEEP and recruitment manoeuvres.\n\nDesign\n\nInternational Multicenter Randomised Controlled Trial\nPre-published protocol and statistical analysis plan\nEthics committees of all institutions approved the study\nInformed consent was obtained from all patients\u2019 representatives\nEligibility was assessed in two phases:\n\nThe first phase (the screening phase) was the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria (see below)\nThe second phase involved patients receiving 3 or more hours of mechanical ventilation following the ARDSNet low-PEEP and low-tidal volume approach\n\nThe FiO2 was then set to 100% and the PEEP to 10 cmH2O for 30 minutes\nPaO2 was then assessed by ABG and the patient was deemed eligible if the PaO2:FiO2 ratio was 200 or lower (and this occurred within 72 hours of the first ratio </= 200 being determined)\n\n\n\n\nRandomisation\n\nRandomisation was in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated allocation list created by an independent statistician\nconducted with blocks of 4 and stratification by site, age (\u226455 years or >55 years) and PaO2:FIO2 ratio (\u2264100 or >100)\n\n\nAllocation concealment via a central web-based system\nBlinding was not possible for the clinicians and outcome assessors, who were aware of the patient\u2019s assigned group following enrolment, however statisticians in charge of analyses were blinded\nEfficacy and safety data were overseen by an independent committee\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nEvent-driven study designed to continue until 520 events (28-day deaths) had accrued, which was estimated to provide 90% power, assuming a hazard ratio of 0.75 and type I error of 5%\nPrimary outcome was analysed using unadjusted Cox\u2019s proportional hazards models and Kaplan Meier curves\nData monitoring committee assessed for harm after one-third and two-thirds of the planned sample size were recruited\n\nSetting\n\n120 intensive care units from 9 countries (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Malaysia, Spain, and Uruguay)\nNovember 2011 to April 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nPatients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation with moderate to severe ARDS of less than 72 hours of duration\nARDS was defined according to the American-European Consensus Conference criteria, and those with a PF ratio <200 (i.e. moderate severity, or worse) were included\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nAge younger than 18 years\nUse of vasoconstrictor drugs in increasing doses over the past 2 hours or mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 65 mm Hg\nContraindications to hypercapnia, such as intracranial hypertension or acute coronary syndrome\nPneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum or pneumatocele (pre-existing or high risk of barotrauma)\nPatients in palliative care only; or\nPreviously enrolled patients\n\n\n1013 patients were randomised\n\n2077 patients screened\n863 were ineligible (as they met exclusion criteria)\n\nMostly PF ratio >200 after standard ventilation (296 patients), increasing vasoconstrictor doses or MAP <65 mmHg (273 patients), or pre-existing/ high risk of barotrauma (139 patients), or contraindication to hypercapnia (129 patients)\n\n\n201 (18.9%) were eligible but were not enrolled for other reasons (mostly lack of consent or unknown reasons)\n\n\nBaseline characteristics\n\nTwo-thirds of the patients had septic shock\nMean number of nonpulmonary organ failures was > 2\nMost ARDS cases were of pulmonary (62.0%) rather than extrapulmonary origin (38.0%)\nIn the intervention and control groups, baseline mean (SD) tidal volume and plateau pressures were 5.8 (1.1) and 5.8 (1.0) mL/Kg of predicted body weight, and 25.8 (4.7) and 26.2 (5.2) cmH2O, respectively\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nLung recruitment strategy and PEEP titrated according to the best respiratory-system compliance\n\n501 patients randomised \u2013 all included in primary analysis\n480 received initial lung recruitment and titration of PEEP\n21 did not received the planned intervention, mostly due to hypotension (14)\n\n\nThe patient was put on pressure control ventilation with a driving pressure (difference between plateau pressure and PEEP) of 15 cmH2O\nThe patient was initially given a bolus of neuromuscular blocker, then the PEEP was increased to 25 for 1 minute, then 35 for 1 minute, then 45 cmH2O for 2 minutes\nFor titration, PEEP was then reduced to 23 cmH2O and the ventilator changed to volume control mode, and PEEP down titrated by 3 cmH2O at a time to a minimum of 11, each step lasting for 4 minutes, after which respiratory-system static compliance was measured\nThe optimal PEEP was then taken to be the PEEP at which the highest compliance was achieved, + 2 cmH2O\nAfter this titration a second round of recruitment was undertaken using a single step of 45 cmH2O PEEP for 2 minutes\nNote that the PEEP values used for recruitment for all patients after the 555th patient were lower and the PEEP down titration was shorter, following a series of cardiac arrests in the intervention group\nFollowing the recruitment manoeuvre and PEEP titration, tidal volume was maintained between 4\u20136 ml/Kg predicted body weight to keep plateau pressure \u2264 30 cmH2O\n\nCopied from Trials. 2012;

days\n\nThere were 277 deaths (55.3%) in the intervention group (501 patients) and 251 deaths (49.3%) in the control group (509 patients)\nThe hazard ratio was 1.20 (95% CI 1.01\u20131.42; p = 0.041)\nFragilty Index = 0\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nDeath at 6 months was higher at 65.3% in the intervention group (HR 1.18; 95% CI 1.01\u20131.38; p = 0.04) than the control group (59.9%)\nThe intervention group had fewer ventilator-free days between day 1 and day 28 than the control group\nPneumothorax requiring drainage within 7 days (only cases that were possibly due to barotrauma) was higher among the intervention group (3.2% vs. 1.2%; risk difference 2.0; 95% CI 0.2\u20133.8; p = 0.03)\nBarotrauma within 7 days (any pneumothorax, pneumo-mediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, or pneumatocele of more than 2 cm that developed between randomisation and 7 days unless caused by invasive procedure) was also higher among the intervention group (5.6% vs. 1.6%; risk difference 4.0; 95% CI 1.5\u20136.5; p = 0.001)\nThese outcomes were not significantly different:\n\nLength of stay in ICU\nLength of stay in hospital\n\n\nNumerous other exploratory outcomes were used\n\n\nSubgroup analyses\n\nThere was no statistically significant difference between subgroups, including:\n\nPaO2:FiO2 ratio (</= 100 vs >100)\nSAPS 3\nExtra vs Pulmonary ARDS; Duration of ARDS (</= 36 or 37-72 hrs)\nDuration of mechanical ventilation prior to randomisation\nBefore vs after the protocol modification\nPer order of enrolment in trial\n\n\n\n\nLung recruitment\n\nIn 78 cases (15.6%) the recruitment maneuver had to be interrupted, most often due to hypotension or a decrease in oxygen saturation\nThe mean (SD) titrated PEEP in the intervention group was 16.8 (3.8) cmH2O\nLung recruitment was repeated after PEEP titration in 393 patients (78.4%)\nLung recruitment was not repeated following an initial manoeuvre and PEEP titration from day 1 to 7 in most patients (62.7%)\n28 patients in the control group received a lung recruitment manoeuvre from days 1-7\n\n\nRespiratory/ventilator variables\n\nThe intervention group had higher mean PEEP, higher mean plateau pressure, equivalent tidal volumes and higher PaO2:FiO2 ratios than the control group\nThe intervention group did not achieve > 2 cmH2O reduction in driving pressure over days 1-7 compared to the control group\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, a strategy with lung recruitment and titrated PEEP compared with low PEEP increased 28-day all-cause mortality\nThese findings do not support the routine use of lung recruitment maneuver and PEEP titration in these patients.\nThe authors noted that the intervention group achieved only small increments in respiratory-system compliance and small reductions in driving pressure which may suggest a mild response to the recruitment manoeuvre\nThe control group followed a strategy that may have ensured better lung protection than in previous studies, with strictly controlled low tidal volumes and higher PEEP than previous studies\nThere may have been some breath stacking which may have contributed to higher driving pressures and barotrauma in the intervention group, though this was not systematically recorded\n\nStrengths\n\nMulticenter randomised controlled trial with rigorous design, including prepublished protocols and statistical analysis, across 9 countries and 120 ICUs\nEvent driven study design ensured adequate events to provide 90% power (assuming HR of 0.75 and type I error of 5%)\nLargest sample size of any lung recruitment trial\nAllocation concealment used\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nUsed appropriate statistical tests and sensitivity analyses\nGood baseline balance between the groups\nMinimal loss to follow up \u2013 only 3 patients from the control group\nUse of mandated standardised period of ventilation to confirm eligibility prior to enrolment\nStandard volume control mechanical ventilation protocol used across both groups after intervention applied\nPatients in both arms received the interventions as planned\n\n95.8% of the intervention group received a lung recruitment manoeuvre\n\n\nNo evidence that effects changed over time during the 6 year trial, nor that the change to the protocol which occurred around halfway through the recruitment significantly affected the outcome\nMinimal significant difference identified secondary to co-interventions, with only the use of neuromuscular blockers (both events and days used) and the use of sedative infusions (events but not days used) being significantly different between the groups\nLower overall incidence of barotrauma than in previous studies using high PEEP\n\nWeaknesses\n\n\n\nBlinding of patients, treating clinicians, and outcome assessors was not possible due to the nature of the intervention\nMay lack external validity to ICUs in other settings due to systemic differences in care delivery (e.g. UK/Europe, North America, Australasia) related to:\n\nThe sites involved (predominantly South American)\nHigh mortality in both arms, compared to patients of similar ARDS severity in countries such as Australia\n\n\nIt is unknown if \u2018best static pulmonary compliance\u2019 is the optimal means of titrating PEEP (e.g. compared with optimal SpO2 used in the PHARLAP trial)\nHigh rates of morbidity and mortality temporally associated with recruitment manoeuvres had not been seen in previously published literature\nIt is unclear how effect the requirement for \u201cnon-escalating noradrenaline\u201d was at excluding under-resuscitated patients who may be more susceptible to haemodynamic compromise from the intervention\nLength of ICU stay and other exploratory outcomes were not included in the original study protocol, but were in the statistical analysis plan\nARDS is a heterogeneous syndrome, it is still possible that some ARDS subgroups are more likely to benefit, or more likely to be harmed by lung recruitment strategies\n\n\n\n\nThe study did \u00a0not assess \u201cPEEP responsiveness\u201d, which has been proposed as a potential indicator of patients more likely to benefit from lung recruitment\nThe effect of lung recruitment manoeuvres and high PEEP cannot be de-aggregated from one another, or necessary co-interventions such as neuromuscular blockade\nActual PEEP was a mean of 3 cmH2O higher in the control group than in similar studies using the ARDSNet strategy\n\nIndeed, anecdotally at least, many clinicians around the world tend to use slightly higher PEEP than prescribed by ARDSNet\n\n\nProning was used as a rescue measure, and was uncommon in both groups (~10% of patients)\n\nSome ICUs may use proning more liberally than this\n\n\nThe recruitment and data collection occurred over 6 years, during which time management of ARDS may have changed \u2013 although subgroup analysis did not suggest this based on order of enrolment\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial confirms that protective lung ventilation is the standard of care for moderate-to-severe ARDS and that an open lung approach with recruitment manoeuvres should not be used routinely.\nThe increased mortality due to the intervention in this study is statistically fragile and may lack external validity to other settings\nSpecific subgroups of ARDS patients may benefit from OLA ventilation with recruitment manoeuvres (e.g. adequately resuscitated patients with PEEP-responsive ARDS and few other risk factors for barotrauma or haemodynamic collapse) but identification of such subroups is uncertain, the evidence for benefit is weak, and there is risk of harm to patients as found in the ART trial\n\nExternal
