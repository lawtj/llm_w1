The American Journal of Emergency Medicine;2016;34(11):2182-2185\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with benign early repolarisation, is there the absence of terminal QRS distortion on the ECG?\n\nBackground\n\nFor patients who present with chest pain, it can be difficult to distinguish between ECG findings of benign early repolarisation (BER) and left anterior descending artery occlusion (LADO)\nTerminal QRS distortion has been reported to be present in a number of patients presenting with LADO\nThis trial investigated whether terminal QRS distortion was also present in patients with BER\n\nDesign\n\nRetrospective observational cohort study\nSecondary analysis\nTerminal QRS distortion defined as the absence of both of the following in V2 and/or V3\n\nS wave\n\nAny deflection at the end of the R wave that dipped below the level of the PQ junction\n\n\nJ wave\n\nAny positive deflection (notching or slurring) above the level of the ST segment at the J point\n\n\n\n\nIf patient had multiple ECGs only 1st ECG analysed\n2 reviewers reported ECGs, not blinded to study objectives\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre, USA\nData collected from 2003 \u2013 2005\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nPatients presented to ED with chest pain\nAdmitted and ruled out for MI with serial troponins \u2013 3 serial negative Troponin I (all below the reference value)\nHad cardiologist confirmed interpretation of ER on the ECG\n\n\nExclusion:\n\n<1mm ST elevation in any of leads V2 \u2013 V4\n\n\n242 patients found to have early repolorisation and a clinical picture of non-ischaemic chest pain\n71 patients excluded as <1mm ST elevation\nMean age 38 years\n86% male\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nTerminal QRS distortion was absent in 100% of patients with benign early repolorisation (95% CI 97.8-100%)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: In patients with BER\n\nS wave absent in\n\n0.6% in lead V2\n9% in lead V3\n\n\nJ wave absent in\n\n95% in lead V2\n83% in lead V3\n\n\n\n\nWhen a J wave was present the S wave was significantly smaller amplitude\n\nMedian S wave amplitude with J wave present vs without J wave present\n\nV2: 4 vs 14.5mm, P=0.004\nV3: 0 vs 9mm, P<0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe presence of any terminal QRS distortion was 100% specific to acute MI\n\nStrengths\n\nUse of two reviewers\nAll patients included were admitted and had serial troponins\nClearly defined criteria for assessing terminal QRS distortion\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRetrospective\nSingle centre\nDid not investigate patients presenting with other causes of ST elevation e.g. pericarditis, left ventricular hypertrophy\nECG readers were not blinded to study objective\nSmall data set compared to the large number of ECGs that are taken daily worldwide\nFull patient demographics not available, and at first glance it is a limited data set (average age 38, and 86% male)- as age, sex, body habitus and ethnicity may all contribute to ECG patterns, a limited pool of patients could have biased the results\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients that have benign early repolorisation there is the absence of terminal QRS distortion\nThe vast majority of patients with BER had a S wave that was present in V2 and/or V3; and those that did not have a S wave always had a J wave\nIf a patient has an absence of a S wave and a J wave in V2/V3 then the diagnosis of BER is very unlikely and based on previous research the diagnosis of acute MI should strongly be considered\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Terminal QRS distortion is present in anterior myocardial infarction but absent in early repolarisation\u00a0\n[further reading]\u00a0Best Explanation of Terminal QRS Distortion in Diagnosis of Electrocardiographically Subtle LAD Occlusion\n[further reading]\u00a0Dr Smith\u2019s ECG Blog\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 16/02/22\nPeer reviewer: Segun Olusanya\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
