ICM 2015 Online First January 1-9\nClinical Question\n\nIn brain-dead organ donors does the use of protocolised fluid therapy compared to usual care improve the number of organs transplanted?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised-controlled trial\nMulti-centre\nStatistical analysis\n\nDesigned to enrol 960 subjects \u2013 powered to detect a 0.5 difference in organs per donor assuming a mean of 3.1 organs transplanted per donor\nPlanned modified intention-to-treat analysis where only subjects able to receive the intervention were included in the protocolised care arm\nTerminated early due to lack of resources on the 23rd of March 2013 enrolling 556 subjects\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n8 organ procurement organisations (OPO) in the USA\n8th October 2009 \u2013 23rd March 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion\n\n> 16 years of age\nDeclared brain dead\nEligible for organ donation\nArterial catheter in place or plan to place\n\n\n\nExclusion\n\nInability to perform minimally invasive haemodynamic monitoring\nReceiving lithium therapy\nSevere aortic regurgitation\nIntra-cardiac shunt\nIntra-aortic balloon pump therapy\nExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation\nVentricular assist device\n\n\n\n\n603 screened, 556 randomised (subsequently 18 and 30 aborted by OPO from control and intervention group respectively)\n\n259 control group\n249 intervention group\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nProtocolised fluid therapy using LiDCO Plus connected to donor\u2019s indwelling arterial catheter. This protocol was followed until transfer to the operating room for organ procurement\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nManaged according to local standard, which DID NOT include functional haemodynamic monitoring\nRandomisation stratified according to donor\u2019s age \u226565 versus <65\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\u00a0Number of organs transplanted per donor \u2013 no difference\nSecondary outcome:\n\nNumber of organs recovered regardless of whether transplanted\n\nNo data provided\n\n\n\u00a0Observed (O) versus expected (E) organs transplanted (O/E) ratio\n\nNo data provided\n\n\nRecipient survival to 6 months\n\nNo data provided at 6 months but no difference in mortality at 12 months post transplant\n\n\n6-month hospital free survival in recipients\n\nNo difference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nCompared to usual care, protocolised fluid therapy did not increase the number of organs transplanted from brain-dead organ donors\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised, multi-centre, pragmatic\nSimple and clear intervention protocol\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnblinded\nDid not achieve recruitment target and terminated early\n\nNearly 10% of enrolled subject aborted\n\n\n\u2018Functional haemodynamic monitoring\u2019 as an exclusion criteria not defined\nLack of standardisation of non-cardiovascular intervention\nProtocol adherence was poor with only a third strictly compliant. Reasons provided in the manuscript were multifactorial\nDuration of cardiac output monitoring was not specified\nResults of specified secondary outcomes not available in main paper or supplement\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe use of protocolised fluid therapy resulted in the use of more fluids in the intervention arm but no difference in the use of vasoactive drugs. The lack of benefit may be a result of a number of reasons including being under-powered and protocol violation. I will continue to adhere to local guidelines develop in collaboration with regional transplant teams\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Article \u2013 abstract] Protocolized fluid therapy in brain-dead donors: the multicenter randomized MOnIToR trial\n[Systematic review \u2013 abstract] Management of the brain-dead organ donor: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n[NHSBT Guidelines] NHS Donor Optimisation Guidelines\n[LITFL \u2013 FOAMed] Management of the organ donation patient\n[Wessex Neuro \u2013 FOAMed] Wessex NeuroICU Guidelines \u2013 Chapter 29\n[Review] Protocolised fluid therapy in brain-dead donors: the MOnIToR trial.
