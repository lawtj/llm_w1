J Crit Care\u00a02016; 34:95-102. doi:10.1016/j.jcrc.2016.04.005\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult mechanically ventilated patients, does inhaled heparin compared to inhaled saline or usual care reduce the incidence of ventilator acquired pneumonia (VAP)?\n\nDesign\n\nFeasibility phase 2b study\nMulti-centre\nRandomised, controlled trial\nDouble-blind design (treating physicians and patients)\nconcealed allocation by off-site computer randomisation\nPermuted block stratification according to study centre and surgical/non-surgical patient status\nPowered at 80% to detect reduction in VAP from expected baseline of 12% to 6%, with statistical significant set at 0.05, if 914 patients recruited\nTrial terminated due to futility after reviewing baseline VAP incidence and a revised power calculation\nIntention to treat analysis\n\nSetting\n\nNumber of centres and location not specified\n\u201c\u2026the majority of patients were recruited from a single center\u201d\nApril 2011 to December 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\u00a0Adult patients over 18 years old; under 24 hours invasive mechanical ventilation; likely to require at least a further 48 hours of mechanical ventilation\nExclusion:\u00a0pregnancy; treatment limitations defined; contraindications to heparin; systemic anticoagulation administration; previous enrolment\n\nRoutine heparin for thromboembolism prevention and renal replacement therapy was allowed\n\n\n2103 screened; 214 randomised; none lost to follow-up\nBaseline characteristics\n\nMean age: 56 years\nMean APACHE II score: 18.9\nMean SOFA score: 6\nGender: 66% male\nPneumonia diagnosis on admission: 42%\nNon-surgical admission: 64%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nHeparin group\n\nNebulised unfractionated heparin 5000 units\nMade up to 2 ml with 0.9% saline\nadministered every 6 hours\n\n\n\nControl\n\nSaline group\n\n0.9% sodium chloride 2 ml\nAdministered every 6 hours\n\n\nUsual Care group\n\nNo nebulised heparin or saline\nAllocation to this group was not \u2018blinded\u2019 to the clinical staff\n\n\n\nManagement common to all groups\n\nStudy drug administered regularly until no longer mechanically ventilated for more than 48 hours or discharge from ICU\nIf re-intubated for further mechanical ventilation, the study drug was administered according to the patient\u2019s previous allocation\nHumidification and all non-saline/heparin nebulised therapies were allowed\nPneumonia was treated according to standard recommendations, with at least 5 days antibiotics\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\u00a0No difference in the incidence of VAP\n\nClinical diagnosis: heparin group 28% vs saline group 24% vs usual care group 26%; P=0.85\nKlompas criteria: heparin group 7% vs saline group 6% vs usual care group 7%; P=1.0\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\u00a0No significant differences found (heparin vs saline vs usual care)\n\nTime to VAP: 7 days vs 7.5 days vs 8 days; P=0.35\nVentilator associated complications: 29% vs 15% vs 18%; P=0.59\nAdverse events: 7% vs 6% vs 1%; P=0.27\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nNebulised 5000 units of unfractionated heparin given four times a day is not recommended for the prophylaxis of ventilator associated pneumonia.\n\nStrengths\n\nGood study methodology so no significant biases likely and probably good accuracy of results (internal validity)\n\nAppropriate randomisation method and concealment\nBlinded treatment and additional \u2018usual care\u2019 group to remove possible influence of nebulised saline\nNo patients lost to follow-up\nObjective definition for primary outcome\n\n\nBroad inclusion criteria so good external validity and generalisability\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnder-powered to firmly conclude that heparin has no effect\n\nPoint effect of Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) for\u00a0heparin group vs all control group is 0.75% (95% CI\u00a0-6.41% to 7.91%)\nAuthors point out that, if this point effect is accurate and baseline is 6%, a trial with 22,000 patients is required to provide sufficient power for firm conclusion!\nAlthough probably clinically negligible, this IPHIVAP trial cannot rule out heparin being beneficial (up to ARR 7.9%) or harmful (up to ARI 6.4%)\n\n\nWith 90% excluded after screening and majority recruited from single centre, some may argue that results are not generalisable\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nNebulised heparin is probably ineffective, or the effect is clinically negligible, therefore I shall not be administering this to my patients to prevent ventilator associated pneumonia\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Is inhaled prophylactic heparin useful for prevention and management of pneumonia in ventilated ICU patients?\n[further reading]\u00a0What is the evidence for the use of nebulised heparin in cystic fibrosis\n[further reading]\u00a0Nebulized anticoagulants for acute lung injury \u2013 a systematic review of preclinical and clinical investigations\n[further reading]\u00a0Rapid and Reproducible Surveillance for Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia by Klompas\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Duncan Chambler\nSummary date:\u00a09 February 2017\nPeer-review editor: Steve Mathieu\n\n\n"
