A Randomized Clinical Trial\nRESTORE Study Investigators. JAMA. First published on line Jan 20 2015: doi10.1001/jama.2014.18399\nClinical Question\n\nDoes a nurse-implemented, goal-directed sedation protocol result in fewer ventilator days in children with acute respiratory failure?\n\nDesign\n\nCluster randomised trial\n\nunits statified by size and, within each stratum, assigned to intervention or control group using computer generated random numbers\n\n\nUnblinded\nPaediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUS) invited to participate in the study needed to:\n\ndemonstrate nursing and physician leadership support\nenroll a minimum of 3 patients per month\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n\n31 PICUs in US\n\n22 PICU\u2019s initially and a further 9 were added at one year\n\n\n2009-2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n2 weeks to 17 years receiving mechanical ventilation for acute airway and/or parenchymal lung disease\nPICU had no sedation protocol\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nlength of mechanical ventilation unlikely to be altered by sedation management e.g anticipated extubation within 24 hours\n\n\n2449 patients\n\nmean age 4.7 years (2 weeks to 17 years)\n52% were between 2 weeks and 2 years\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nProtocolised sedation\n\n17 PICUs\n1225 patients\n\n\nIncluded\n\nStandard choice of sedative agents.\n\nPrimary agents: morphine (or fentanyl if hypotensive or reactive airway disease) and midazolam\nSecondary agents:\n\ndexmedetomidine and propofol (to facilitate extubation)\nclonidine, pentobarbital or ketamine (if unresponsive to primary agents)\nmethadone if Withdrawal Assessment Tool (WAT-1) scores continued to above target\n\n\n\n\nDaily team discussions to determine phase of illness and readiness to wean (acute, titration, or weaning phase)\nprescribing a target State Behavioural Score (SBS)\ndaily extubation readiness test (ERT) when spontaneously breathing with an oxygenation index of 6 or lower\n\nif ERT unfavourable -> returned to pretest ventilator settings and ERT repeated next morning\nif ERT showed failure because of excessive sedation, this was weaned and then retested\nif ERT favourable -> patient extubated within 6 hours unless needed to remain intubated for non-pulmonary reasons\n\n\nadjustment of sedatives at least 8 hourly\ndiscontinuation of opioids and benzodiazepines when no longer necessary\nwritten sedation weaning plan when transferred out of PICU\n\n\n\nControl\n\nUsual care\n\n14 PICUs\n1224\n\n\nSedation managed in usual way for that unit. Sedatives were selected, prescribed, and titrated at the discretion of the medical team. No recommendations were made for extubation readiness testing\nControl PICUs did not receive a copy of the algorithm for the intervention group\n\n\nA baseline phase occurred in both groups where all PICUs implemented the same validated pain, sedation and iatrogenic withdrawal assessment instruments\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nmedian duration of mechanical ventilation\n\n6.5 days in both groups, p=0.61\nno difference when adjusted for age group, PRISM-III-12 score and POPC score > 1 at enrollment\n\n\n% not successfully extubated by day 28\n\n8% in protocol group vs 11% in usual care group, P=0.19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8 Secondary outcomes: (protocol vs. usual care)\n\nNeurological testing to evaluate a change in mental status was the only outcome to be statistically different\n\n14% vs 19%, P=0.03\n\n\nNo difference in:\n\nmedian time to recovery from acute respiratory failure\nmedian time to wean from mechanical ventilation\nmedian time to onset of assisted breathing\nmedian length of stay in PICU\nmedian length of stay in hospital\n% in hospital 28 day mortality\n% in hospital 90 day mortality PICU length of stay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdverse effects\n\nHigher % of post-extubation stridor in usual care group 7% vs 4% P=0.03\nHigher % of immobility-related stage 2 or more pressure ulcers in usual care group 2% vs <1% P-0.01\nNo difference in pain management, extubation failure, unplanned extubations, ventilator associated pneumonia, catheter related blood stream infections or unplanned removal of lines\n\n\n\n\nUse of sedative agents\n\ndexmedetomidine used twice as much in usual care group (49% vs 23%, P=<0.001)\nmethadone used twice as much in usual care group (30% vs 12%, P=<0.001)\nchloralhydrate use greater in usual care group (15% vs 3%m P=0.01)\nuse of midazolam was similar in the protocol vs usual care group (82% vs 90%)\nfentanyl was more commonly used as first line opioid in the usual care group 81% vs 35%\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe use of a sedation protocol compared with usual care did not reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in critically ill children presenting with acute respiratory failure\n\nStrengths\n\nWell powered. Full recruitment for 90% power\nLarge multi-centre paediatric study with useful primary outcome measures\nThe multi-disciplinary staff in units randomised to protocolised weaning received a combination of direct learning and training materials to try and maximise compliance\nAdherence with protocol was high (71-100%). Prescribed sedation was achieved 98% of the time\nThe use of different sedation protocols for varying stages of the illness is an interesting concept and makes physiological sense\n\nWeaknesses\n\n35% of patients who were eligible were not included as consent was not obtained\n\nconsent rates were lower in the intervention group (72% vs 84%; p=0.01)\n\n\nExclusion of patients that they thought would be sedated for short period (e.g. peri-op). This might be appropriate, and does seem to be standard in adult sedation studies\nThe use of dexmedetomidine increased each year throughout this study. It was also used more often than in the control group which may have resulted in less opioid and benzodiazepine requirement\nSelection bias may have occurred as this was an unblinded study\nThe baseline characteristics were different. The intervention group enrolled more patients < 2 years (58% vs 45%) and more patients with bronchiolitis (typically more difficult to sedate). The predicted risk of mortality based on PRISM III-12 score was also lower in patients < 2 years in the intervention group (1.7% vs. 3.8%)\nChloral hydrate was used in 3% of cases in the protocol group. This is a non-protocol sedative. Arguably would not have influenced the overall result greatly\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nClinical outcomes for nurse led sedation protocol for children requiring mechanical ventilation compared with \u2018usual care\u2019 was no different. With in hospital mortality rates of around 6% it may just be that \u2018usual care\u2019 is actually \u2018exemplary care\u2019. ARISE & ProCESS are other examples of this. Further studies perhaps using less complex sedation management strategies, more selective sedative agent choice and refined outcome measures may be helpful in the future.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[abstract only] Protocolized sedation vs usual care in pediatric patients mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure: a randomized clinical trial\u00a0\n[editorial] Protocolized sedation in critically ill children\n[other] Sedation protocol does not reduce time of respiratory support\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @stevemathieu75\nSummary date: 6th Feb 2015\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler & @davidslessor\n\n\n\n"
