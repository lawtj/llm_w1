The Lancet 1961, Volume 278, Issue 7199, Pages 404-406\nClinical Question\n\nDoes the application of cricoid pressure during induction of anaesthesia control the regurgitation and \u00a0pulmonary aspiration of gastric or oesophageal contents?\n\nDesign\n\nCase series of 26 patients\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre (Middlesex Hospital, London)\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Patients at \u2018high risk\u2019 of regurgitation of oesophageal or stomach contents\n\n18 laparotomy for intestinal obstruction\n3 gastrectomy for pyloric stenosis\n2 oesophagoscopy for achalasia of the cardia\n2 forceps delivery\n1 resection for oesophageal cancer\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nApplication of cricoid pressures\n\nexerted by an assistant (nurse or midwife accompanying patient \u2018can be shown in a few seconds how to do it\u2019\nbefore induction, cricoid is palpated and lightly held between the thumb and second finger. Pressure is exerted on the cricoid cartilage mainly by the index finger as anaesthesia begins\nas soon as consciousness is lost, firm pressure is applied without obstruction of the patient\u2019s airway\ncricoid pressure is maintained until intubation and inflation of the cuff of the endotracheal tube is completed\n\n\nIn all cases:\n\nRyle\u2019s or oesophageal tubes were fully aspirated and then removed before induction of anaesthesia. The rationale was that this would otherwise interfere with the effectiveness of cricoid pressure\npatients were positioned in a slight head-down tilt\n\n\nOther interventions:\n\npre-oxygenation was advised\nan intravenous barbituate and muscle relaxant was used. However, if the patient was \u2018seriously ill\u2019 inhalational induction was considered\n\n\nA short acting muscle relaxant was noted to provide faster intubating conditions\n\nControl\n\nNo control group\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: regurgitation of oesophageal or gastric content visualised into the pharynx\n\n23 patients \u2013 cricoid pressure maintained until endotracheal cuff inflated\n\n0 witnessed regurgitation\n\n\n3 patients \u2013 cricoid pressure released after induction of anaesthesia and before intubation\n\n3 out of 3 had regurgitation\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome: whilst the author concludes that cricoid pressure prevents gastric distension from bag-valve-mask ventilation, this is not mentioned in the results and the methodology just reports that it is feasible to do this\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nCricoid pressure can a) control regurgitation of stomach or oesophageal contents during induction of anaesthesia and b) prevent gastric distension from postive-pressure ventilation applied by facepiece or mouth-to-mouth respiration. It is contraindicated during active vomiting\n\nStrengths\n\nThis is an important case series from over 60 years ago\nThe choice of technique for intubation was based on practice at the time and therefore easily applicable\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThere are many\u2026\nNot randomised\nOnly 3 patients had cricoid pressure released and no statistical tools should be applied\nRemoving an orogastric tube in a patient who is considered \u2018high risk\u2019 is questionable now\nPositioning head down again is not modern practice and would have increased the risk of regurgitation. Whether it reduces risk of aspiration can be debated but this case series was looking for regurgitation\nForce used with cricoid pressure not mentioned or validated\nThere is no mention of choice of anaesthetic agents and whilst a quick acting muscle relaxant may have been used, it not clear if this did happen\nNo mention of grades of anaesthetists involved. Variability in practice including the use of positive pressure ventilation prior to intubation will affect gastric distension regardless of whether cricoid pressure is applied\nDifficulties such as recognised oesophageal intubation are not mentioned. This would increase your risk of regurgitation\nThis is Grade 4 evidence and strength of recommendation would be low by current standards\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThere is no empirical evidence supporting the use of cricoid pressure (CP) beyond this single case series and expert opinion (grade 4-5 evidence)\nThose advocating its use, emphasise the associated high mortality rate if aspiration occurs. Opposition point to the poor evidence for improved safety and potential harm with CP. This includes making it harder to intubate and ventilate if the anatomy of the glottis becomes distorted as well as decreasing oesophageal tone (which may actually increase the risk of regurgitation)\nThe Difficult Airway Society (DAS) are revising their guidelines for 2015 and I hope will begin to de-emphasise the overstated evidence base for CP use in RSI.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[abstract] Cricoid Pressure to Control Regurgitation of Stomach Contents During Induction of Anaesthesia\n[further reading]\u00a0Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine \u2013 Levels of Evidence (March 2009)\n[further reading] Cricoid Pressure.
