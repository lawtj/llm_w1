NEJM October 2018 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1714919\nClinical Question\n\nIn ICU patients at risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding does the use of prophylactic proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) compared to placebo reduce mortality at 90 days?\n\nBackground\n\nCritically ill patients are at risk stress-related upper GI bleeding with its associated mortality and morbidity\nThe adverse events associated with PPI use include nosocomial pneumonia, C. difficile enteritis and myocardial ischaemia\n\nDesign\n\nMulticentre, stratified, placebo-controlled, blinded (pts, clinicians, investigators and statisticians)\nComputer-generated, block randomisation, stratified according to trial site\n1:1 assignment to intervention or placebo\n90% power to detect an absolute difference of 5% in 90 day mortality between groups\n\nAssuming baseline mortality of 25% at 90 days\n3350 patients would be needed\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n33 ICUs in 6 countries (Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and UK)\nJanuary 2016 to October 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n18 years or older\nnon-elective ICU admission\nat least 1 risk factor for GI bleeding\n\nShock\nRenal replacement therapy\nInvasive mechanical ventilation > 24 hours\nCoagulopathy\nOngoing treatment with anticoagulants\nHistory of coagulopathy\nHistory of chronic liver disease\n\n\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nContraindications to PPI\nOngoing treatment with PPI and/or H2-antagonists\nGI bleeding during current hospital admission\nConfirmed diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease\nOrgan transplant during current hospital admission\nWithdrawal of active treatment\nFertile woman with positive urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or plasma-hCG\n\n\n3298 pts recruited\nBaseline characteristics were well matched except for a higher incidence of chronic lung disease and coagulopathy in intervention group, and a higher proportion of pts post emergency surgery in the control group\n\nMedian age 67, 64% men, median SOFA score 9\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n40mg Pantoprazole\n\nSingle, once a day bolus suspended in 10mls 0.9% saline\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\nSingle, once a day bolus suspended in 10mls 0.9% saline\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nMedication continued from randomisation until ICU discharge or death, for a maximum of 90 days\nAll other interventions were chosen at the discretion of the clinician\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: 90-day all cause mortality\n\n31.1% (intervention) vs 30.4% (control)\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nProportion of patients with 1 or more of the following clinically important adverse events \u2013 GI bleeding, pneumonia, C difficile infection, acute myocardial ischaemia\n\n21.9% (intervention) vs 22.6% (control)\n\n\nClinically important GI bleeding\n\nDefined as overt GI bleeding and at least 1 of the following: spontaneous drop of systolic, mean or diastolic BP of 20mmHg or more, start of vasopressor or 20% increase in vasopressor dose, decrease in Hb of at least 2g/dl, transfusion of 2u packed RBCs\n\n2.5% (intervention) vs 4.2% (control)\n\n\n\n\nInfectious adverse events in the ICU\n\nProportion of pts with 1 or more episodes of pneumonia (according to modified CDC criteria) or C difficile infection\u00a0(treatment with antibiotics for suspected or proven C difficile infection)\n\n16.8% (intervention) vs 16.9% (control)\n\n\n\n\nSerious adverse reactions in the ICU\n\nnone in both groups\n\n\nDays alive without the use of life support (median)\n\n92 (intervention) vs 92 (control)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn adult patients admitted to the ICU for an acute condition and were at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, there was no significant differences between pantoprazole and placebo with regard to either 90-day mortality or the number of patients with a composite outcome of four clinically important events.\n\nStrengths\n\nLarge, multicentre with appropriate blinding strategy\nRelevant clinical question\n\nWeaknesses\n\nComposite secondary outcome was not a well-used, established one\nNo P values provided for secondary outcomes because of the lack of adjustments for multiple comparisons (accepting limitations of interpreting secondary outcomes)\nVery broad inclusion criteria and definitions (both of \u2018high risk\u2019 and outcomes)\nPowered to detect 5% mortality improvement which is perhaps unrealistic\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAlthough no mortality benefit was demonstrated, the incidence of clinically important GI bleeds (secondary outcome and hence the usual caveats apply), was lower in the pantoprazole group\nThis trial is about starting PPI so does not change my current practice of stopping acid-suppression medication in patients established on enteral feed except in high risk groups (high dose corticosteroids, high dose vasopressors etc)\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Pantoprazole in Patients at Risk for Gastrointestinal Bleeding in
