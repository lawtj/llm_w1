Resuscitation 2019;134(1-9) doi: 10.1016/j.resuscitation.2018.12.002\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients that survive with a good neurological outcome following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, does 48 hours vs. 24 hours of therapeutic hypothermia, improve memory, attention & executive functions at 6 months?\n\nBackground\n\nCognitive sequelae are frequent in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Memory is the most common cognitive domain that is affected\nTargeted temperature management (TTM) has been shown to decrease mortality and improve cognitive function. The optimal duration of TTM is unclear\nThe TTH48 trial reported no significant difference with 24 hours vs. 48 hours of hypothermia in terms of cerebral outcome or mortality at 6 months\nHypothermia studies, including the TTH48 trial, typically use crude measures of outcome such as Cerebral Performance Category (CPC score). More subtle differences may therefore be missed\n\nDesign\n\nPredefined post-hoc study of the randomised open-label TTH48 trial\nPatients invited to neuropsychological assessment of memory, attention, executive function at 6 months\nBlinding of outcome assessor\nEstimate of pre-morbid intelligence assessed by WAIS-IV Vocabulary test to control for pre-morbid level of cognitive function\n13 cognitive tests assessed. Patient considered to be cognitively impaired if their performance was below the cut-off score for 3 or more tests\n\nSetting\n\nTwo university hospitals in Denmark & Norway (Original TTH48 trial included 10 units)\nOriginal TTH48 trial conducted from 2013-2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nEnrolled in TTH48 trial\nGood cognitive function prior to cardiac arrest: CPC score <=2\nGood cognitive outcome at 6 months: CPC score <=2\n\n\nExclusion: as per TTH48 trial\n79 patients included in the study out of 111 eligible patients. 355 patients were originally enrolled in TTH48 study\nNo significant differences between intervention and control groups, or between study participants and patients lost to follow up:\n\nComparing TTM24 (n=36) vs. TTM48 (n=43):\n\nMale: 94% vs. 86%\nCPC 1: 81% vs. 70%\nBasic CPR: 86% vs. 91%\nShockable rhythm: 94% vs. 95%\nAge: 58 vs. 57\nMinutes to ROSC: 18 vs. 18\nDays since OHCA: 187 vs. 188\nVocabulary (WAIS-IV): 27 vs. 31\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nProlonged TTM for 48 hours\n\nControl\n\nStandard TTM for 24 hours\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nTemperature controlled to 33C+-1C\n\nOutcome\n\nUnadjusted multivariate regression, comparing control group vs. intervention group treatment effect (positive treatment effect number indicates improved outcome in TTM48 group, except for trail making tests where negative number indicates improved outcome in TTM48 group):\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\n\u00a0Attention\n\nTrail making A: 49.24 vs. -3.85\nTrail making B: 120.15 vs. -12.75\nDigit span: 22.89 vs. 0.20\n\n\nExecutive function\n\nFluency phonemic: 28.06 vs. 2.13\nFluency semantic: 35.23 vs. 1.91\nFluency categoric: 11.17 vs. 0.92\n\n\n\n\nVerbal memory \u2013 RAVLT: auditory verbal memory retrieval of 15 words\n\nRAVLT learning \u2013 no significant difference\n\n34.63 vs. 2.01\n\n\nRAVLT recall 30 min \u2013 significantly improved in TTM48 group\n\n4.83 vs. 1.94, p=0.0004\nNNT 4.1 (95% C.I. 2.7-12)\n\n\nRAVLT recognition \u2013 no significant difference\n\n10.70 vs. 0.92\n\n\n\n\nVisual memory \u2013 ROCFT: visual memory retrieval of a complex figure\n\nROCFT copy \u2013 no significant difference\n\n32.91 vs. -0.15\n\n\nROCFT recall 3 minute \u2013 significantly improved in TTM 48 group\n\n13.78 vs. 3.16, p=0.0032\nNNT 5.9 (95% C.I 3.2-infinity)\n\n\nROCFT recall 30 minutes \u2013 significantly improved in TTM 48 group\n\n13.81 vs. 2.9, p=0.0048\nNNT 6.3 (95% C.I. 3.2-infinity)\n\n\nROCFT recognition \u2013 no significant difference\n\n19.83 vs. 0.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-variate regression analysis adjusted for age and time to ROSC revealed slightly stronger association of TTM48 with significant differences in the same 3 memory tests\nOverall cognitive impairment \u2013 significantly greater in TTM24 group\n\n33% vs. 12%, relative risk ratio 2.9 (95% C.I. 1.1-7.4), NNT 4.6\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with perceived good cognitive outcome, 48 hours of therapeutic hypothermia was associated with reduced memory deficits and cognitive impairment at 6 months, compared with 24 hours of therapeutic hypothermia\n\nStrengths\n\nBlinding of outcome assessor\nControlled for level of pre-morbid cognitive function\nPre-defined analysis of randomised controlled trial\nMulti-centre\nPatient orientated outcomes\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPost-hoc analysis\nNearly 30% of patients lost to follow up\nSmall numbers in each group\nOnly included patients with perceived good cognitive outcome\nAlthough not statistically significant, patients in TTM24 group were less likely to participate in the study, and had a higher rate of a CPC 1 score\nMultiple cognitive tests assessed with no primary outcome \u2013 increased probability of type 1 error\nROCFT recognition trial had a number of missing values\nOnly 2 institutions completed this study out of the 10 that were included in the TTH48 trial\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis pre-planned post-hoc analysis of the TTH48 trial, reported that in patients with an out of hospital cardiac arrest who were treated with 48 hours of therapeutic hypothermia vs. 24 hours had significantly reduced memory deficits at 6 months\nDue to the methodological weaknesses further trials are warranted before this becomes standard practice\nFuture trials assessing cognitive function post cardiac arrest should, as this trial did, include more detailed assessments than CPC scores\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Prolonged temperature management reduces memory deficits at 6 months post-cardiac arrest: A randomised controlled trial\n[further reading]\u00a0Targeted Temperature Management for 48 vs 24 Hours and Neurological Outcome After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Dave Slessor\nSummary date: 15 April 2019\nPeer-review editor: Fraser Magee\n\n\n"
