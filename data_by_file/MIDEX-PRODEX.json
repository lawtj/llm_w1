JAMA 2012; 307:1151-1160. doi:10.1001/jama.2012.304.\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult intensive care patients requiring mechanical ventilation, is dexmedetomidine inferior to\u00a0propofol or midazolam in achieving target sedation level?\n\nDesign\n\nParallel trial design, depending on the study centre\u2019s usual practice\n\nMIDEX: midazolam\nPRODEX: propofol\n\n\nNon-inferiority statistical design\n\u2018Double-dummy\u2019 design with opaque syringe and giving set to mask propofol administration\nDouble blind design \u2013 study personnel and patients were unaware of the group allocation\nDeemed non-inferior if the 95% confidence intervals for the dexmedetomidine\u00a0to standard sedation ratio for the time within target RASS score did not cross 0.85 (i.e. 15% inferiority margin)\n\nFor 90% power a sample size of 450 in each trial was required\n(RASS score is Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale \u2013 see external links at bottom)\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nMIDEX: 44 centres in 9 European countries\nPRODEX: 31 centres in 6 European countries and 2 in Russia\n2007 through 2010\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: over 18 years; invasive mechanical ventilation; target RASS score 0 to -3 (light to moderate sedation); expected to require sedation for at least 24 hours; within 72 hours of ICU admission and within 48 hours of starting either midazolam or propofol\nExclusion: acute severe neurological disorder; MAP < 55 mmHg despite optimisation; heart rate < 50/min; AV conduction defects; recent use of alpha agonists or antagonists\nMIDEX: 8301 ventilated patients screened of which 501 randomised\nPRODEX: 11610 ventilated patients screened of which 500 randomised\n\nIntervention\n\nDexmedetomidine 0.2-1.4 mcg/kg/hr\n\nControl\n\nMIDEX: midazolam 0.03-0.2 mg/kg/hr\nPRODEX: propofol 0.3-4.0 mg/kg/hr\n\nOutcome\nIn words\n\nPrimary outcome: non-inferiority of dexmedetomidine confirmed against both midazolam and propofol\n\nTime at target sedation (RASS 0 to -3) without rescue medication was similar for midazolam vs dexmedetomidine and for propofol vs dexmedetomidine. Small differences were not significant and the 95% confidence intervals for the ratio did not cross 0.85.\nDuration of mechanical ventilation was significantly shorter for dexmedetomidine compared to midazolam, but the slightly shorter duration for dexmedetomidine against propofol was not statistically significant.\n\n\nSecondary outcome: superiority of dexmedetomidine was suggested but not confirmed statistically\n\nMedian length of stay in ICU was shorter for dexmedetomidine against both midazolam and propofol, but differences were not statistically significant.\nThe nurses\u2019 assessment of patient arousal, cooperation and communication by visual analogue scale were higher (better) for dexmedetomidine against both midazolam and propofol.\n\n\nOther data outcomes:\n\nMean sedation scores were higher for dexmedetomidine against both midazolam and propofol with statistical significance.\n\n\n\nIn numbers\n\u00a0\n\nPrimary Outcome\n\n\nStudy\nDexmedetomidine\nUsual Drug\nEstimated ratio\n95% CI\np\n\n\n\n\nTime at target sedation without rescue medicine \u2013 proportion of total time\n\n\nMIDEX\n60.7%\n56.6%\n1.07\n0.97 \u2013 1.18\n0.15\n\n\nPRODEX\n64.6%\n64.7%\n1.00\n0.92 \u2013 1.08\n0.97\n\n\nMedian duration of MV (including NIV) \u2013 hours [IQR]\n\n\nMIDEX\n123 [67\u2013337]\n164 [92\u2013380]\n\n\n0.03\n\n\nPRODEX\n97 [45\u2013257]\n118 [48\u2013327]\n\n\n0.24\n\n\n\n\nCI = confidence interval; p = p-value; MV = mechanical ventilation; NIV = non-invasive ventilation\n\n\n\n\nPre-defined Secondary Outcomes\n\n\nStudy\nDexmedetomidine\nUsual Drug\nMD\n95% CI\np\n\n\n\n\nMedian length of ICU stay \u2013 hours [IQR]\n\n\nMIDEX\n211 [115\u2013831]\n243 [140\u2013630]\nn/a\n0.27\n\n\nPRODEX\n164 [90\u2013480]\n185 [93\u2013520]\nn/a\n0.54\n\n\nCombined VAS (as mm out of 100) for nurses\u2019 assessment of arousal, cooperation and communication\n\n\nMIDEX\n49.7\n30.0\n19.7\nFavours dexmedetomidine\n15.2 \u2013 24.2\n<0.001\n\n\nPRODEX\n51.3\n40.1\n11.2\nFavours dexmedetomidine\n6.4 \u2013\u00a015.9\n<0.001\n\n\n\n\nMD = mean difference; CI = confidence intervals; p = p-value; VAS = visual analogue scale\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nDexmedetomidine is non-inferior to midazolam and propofol for long-term mild to moderate sedation on intensive care.\nIt may reduce time to extubation and it does improve communication between staff and patients.\n\nStrengths\n\nEfficient use of parallel trial design\nClinically useful outcome measure\nIndependent statistical analysis helps toward preventing any bias from sponsoring manufacturer\nPer-protocol analysis for non-inferiority primary outcome will prevent bias toward non-inferiority conclusion, whereas the intention-to-treat analysis for\u00a0efficacy\u00a0secondary outcomes prevent bias toward positive difference. This approach will limit the chance of false positive conclusions.\nExtensive online publication of raw data\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSponsored by manufacturer of dexmedetomidine with significant trial design, oversight and manuscript input\nRecruitment rate averages 3 to 4 patients per year per centre! Was there selection bias?\nOnly short term measures of delirium and neurocognitive problems used\nThe finding that mean sedation scores were higher in patients managed with dexmedetomidine may be a confounding factor (by chance or by accidental unblinding) leading to a bias that favours dexmedetomidine. Alternatively, it may be a positive finding that sedation was easier to manage and titrate with dexmedetomidine.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis non-inferiority trial opens the door to using dexmedetomidine in intensive care, but further trials with longer-term neurocognitive follow-up and cost-analysis are required before it can be recommended as first-line.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0Dexmedetomidine vs Midazolam or Propofol for Sedation During Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation Two Randomized Controlled Trials\n[further reading]\u00a0Dexmedetomidine by Life in the Fast Lane\n[further reading] CONSORT guidance for non-inferiority trials\n[further reading] The pros and cons of noninferiority trials by Pocock\n[further reading] The Richmond-Agitation Sedation Scale by ICUDelirium.org\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 28 September 2014\nPeer-review editor: @DavidSlessor\n\n\n"
