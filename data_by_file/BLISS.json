ICM 2016; doi:10.1007//s00134-015-4188-0\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult ICU patients with severe sepsis does the use of continuous infusion (CI) of beta-lactam antibiotics compared to intermittent bolus (IB) improve clinical outcomes?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\nProspective, two-centre, open-labelled\n\nComputerised block randomisation\nUnblinded staff prepared drugs\nUnblinded staff provided care and management plans\nBlinded investigators assess primary outcome\n\n\nSample size of 120 patients (60 in each group) to demonstrate a statistical significant difference in primary end point assuming 75% and 45% clinical cure rate in intervention and control group.\nIntention-to-treat (ITT) analysis for primary outcome, in addition to:\n\nModified intention-to-treat (mITT) conducted in eligible patients who received at least one dose of study drug\nPer protocol analysis of pts who received study drug for > 4 days\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n2 ICUs in Malaysia\nRecruitment from April 2013 to July 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdult (>18 years)\nSevere sepsis (defined as presumed or confirmed infection with new organ dysfunction) in previous 48 hours\nIndication for cefepime, meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam with < 24 hr therapy at time of assessment\nExpected ICU stay greater than 48 hrs\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nReceiving renal replacement therapy\nImpaired hepatic function (total bilirubin > 100umol/ml)\nPatients receiving palliative care\nInadequate central venous catheter access\nDeath was deemed imminent\n\n\n220 patients screened, 140 eligible patients randomised.
