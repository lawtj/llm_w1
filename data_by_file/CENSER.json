Published online February 1. doi:10.1164/rccm.201806-1034OC\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients presenting to the emergency department with septic shock, does early low-dose norepinephrine compared with standard care increase shock control at six hours?\n\nBackground\n\nThe optimal timing for introduction of vasopressor therapy in patients with septic shock is not known. Traditionally, patients with sepsis and hypotension are given fluids first and the introduction of vasopressors follows in an ad hoc fashion depending on response to the fluid therapy\nThe Surviving Sepsis Campaign Bundle, updated in 2018, suggests rapid initial resuscitation with the aim to achieve the following in the first hour\n\nmeasure lactate (repeat if initial elevated >2mmol/L)\nobtain blood cultures before antibiotics\nadminister broad-spectrum antibiotics\nbegin rapid administration of 30ml/kg of crystalloid if hypotensive or lactate >4mmol/L\nApply vasopressors if hypotensive during or after fluid resuscitation to maintain MAP >65mmHg\n\n\nOverall, there are elements of this bundle that are controversial and based on weak levels of evidence\nThere has not been any large prospective studies in humans to define the optimal timing of introduction of vasopressor support, ie before fluid resuscitation vs during fluid resuscitation vs following a trial of fluid resuscitation\nA pilot trial examining a\u00a0regimen of restricted fluids and early vasopressor compared to usual care for initial resuscitation of hypotension due to suspected sepsis has been completed and published (REFRESH trial) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30382308\n\nDesign\n\nSingle centre, double-blind, RCT\n1:1 assignment to groups\nAllocation concealment achieved by a computer-generated randomisation table\nBlinding; the study drug, noradrenaline, and the placebo were packaged in identical containers\nThe outcome assessors were unaware of the group allocation\nA sample size of 300 would provide 80% power to detect a predicted rate of shock resolution of 80% in the norepinephrine group vs 60% in the placebo group\nAnalysis was by intention to treat\n\nSetting\n\nThe trial was conducted at Siriraj Hospital, a large university-based, tertiary referral hospital in Thailand\nRecruitment occurred between October 2013 and March 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: patients >18 years, presenting to the emergency department with MAP <65mmHg with infection as the suspected cause\nExclusion: septic shock >1 hour, acute CVA, ACS, APO, status asthmatics, active cardiac arrhythmia, acute GIH, pregnancy, burns, advanced cancer, refusing medical therapies\n456 patients with MAP<65mmHg were screened. 320 of these met the inclusion criteria. Seven patients in the intervention arm and 3 in the control arm withdrew consent to participate. This left 310 patients, allocated to 2 groups with 155 patients per group\nBaseline demographics were well matched, including age, source of sepsis, co-morbidities and APACHE II scores\n\nIntervention\n\n4mg of norepinephrine was added to 250ml of 5% Dextrose and administered through a peripheral line or central line at 0.05 ug/kg/min (for a 70kg person this equals 13ml/hr, or 3.5 mcg/min)\n\nThe drug was infused for 24 hours without titration\n\n\n\nControl\n\n250ml of 5% dextrose run peripherally or centrally at an identical rate without titration\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll other treatments were as per the SSC guideline of 2012, that is, crystalloid bolus, antibiotics, source control and organ support\nIf MAP>65mmHg not achieved after 30ml/hr of crystalloid then open label vasopressors were permitted\nPatients were managed in the ICU OR the ward, with a central line OR peripheral line, with an arterial line OR with 15 minutely BP checks\nPatients were admitted to the ICU if they needed mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy or invasive haemodynamic monitoring\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: shock control by 6 hours. This was defined as sustained MAP>65mmHg (>15 minutes) AND 2 consecutive hours of urine output >0.5ml/kg/hr OR decrease in serum lactate >10% from the initial lactate level.\n\nEarly norepinephrine group vs the control group: 76.1% vs 48.4% achieved shock resolution at 6 hours (OR 3.4, 95% CI 2.09-5.53, p<0.001)\n\n\nSecondary outcome: Early norepinephrine group vs control group\n\nMortality at Day 28: 15.5% vs 21.9% (p=0.15)\nShock resolution in hours (median): 4:45hrs vs 6:02hrs (p=<0.001)\nIntravenous fluid before open label norepinephrine (median): 2080ml vs 1900ml (p=0.32)\nNeed for open label norepinephrine: 67.7% vs 80% (p=0.014)\nTime from diagnosis to any norepinephrine (median hours): 1:10 vs 2:47 (p<0.001)\nAdmission to ICU: 54.8% vs 51.6% (p=0.57)\nMechanical ventilation: 37.4% vs 38.1% (p=0.91)\nRenal Replacement Therapy: 12.3% vs 14.8% (p = 0.51)\nPulmonary Oedema: 14.4% vs 27.7% (p=0.004)\nNew-onset arrhythmia: 11% vs 20% (p=0.03)\nSkin necrosis: 0.6% vs 0.6%\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nEarly norepinephrine was associated with increased shock control at 6 hours\n\nStrengths\n\nThis phase II clinical trial proposes an important clinical question that will add to the literature regarding optimal timing of vasopressor use in septic shock\nIt is the first prospective trial examining this specific component of the surviving sepsis bundle.\nAllocation concealment, blinding, intention to treat analysis, complete follow-up achieved\nLactate clearance has previously been found to be a useful surrogate for mortality prediction in patients with septic shock\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle centre trial in a developing nation with limited ICU resources \u2013 reduces the external validity of the trial\nClinicians may be able to guess the allocation of the patient group as they may see an increment in the blood pressure, thus unblinding the trial. The authors point out that around 20% of the control group also had an increment in blood pressure\nThe primary outcome was not clinically meaningful. \u00a0Secondary outcomes were clinically meaningful but the trial was not powered to detect differences in these and thus these are hypothesis generating outcomes which may guide design of future trials in this area\nOf interest, patients received similar median volumes of resuscitative fluids. Early use of vasopressors in septic shock has been promoted as a way to reduce fluid volumes administered but this was not seen here\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nOverall the results seem encouraging and would certainly provide a basis to conduct a larger, multi-centre trial to explore the important question of timing of initiation of vasopressor therapies in septic shock\nLow-dose, dilute norepinephrine was given safely through a peripheral line in more than half the patients, \u00a0without adverse effect. This is reassuring that this practice is safe in time-poor or resource-poor environments\nThis is a well-conducted trial that really adds to the literature base for management of septic shock\n\nExternal Links\n\nEarly Use of Norepinephrine in Septic Shock Resuscitation (CENSER): A Randomised Trial\nThe 2018 Surviving Sepsis Campaign\u2019s Treatment Bundle: When Guidelines Outpace the Evidence Supporting Their Use.
