JAMA 2018; 319:680\u2013690 doi:10.1001/jama.2018.0160\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill adults, does haloperidol 1 mg or haloperidol 2 mg given three times a day compared to placebo reduce mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nDelirium, which is acute confusion, inattention and fluctuating consciousness, represents neurological dysfunction and is common in critically ill patients, with up to 80% of ventilated patients suffering from delirium\nAlthough several risk factors have been identified, and validated assessment tools have been produced, there are no pharmacological agents with clear benefit in preventing or treating delirium\nHaloperidol is widely used to treat delirium, but lacks conclusive evidence to support this\n\nThe HOPE-ICU trial did not demonstrate a difference in coma-free and delirium-free days in critically ill adults with delirium\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\nMulti-centre study\nRandom allocation in 1:1:1 ratio across three groups\nOnly the trial pharmacist and safety management board were aware of allocation sequence, so that patients and clinical staff were blinded to group allocation\nConsent was sought immediately on admission to critical care\n\nDeferred consent was obtained from those unable to prospectively give consent\n\n\nSample size calculation based upon before-after observational study\n\nAssumed effect size would produce Hazard Ratio of 0.85 (15% relative reduction in death over time)\nDefined Power 0.8 and \u03b1 error 0.05\nRequired 715 patients per group\n\n\nAnalysis was modified intention-to-treat (those that withdrew consent were not included)\n\nSubgroup and per-protocol sensitivity analyses also conducted\n\n\nIndependent data and safety management board reviewed results at four points with defined thresholds for stopping \u2013 either for futility or superiority\n\nThe 1 mg Haloperidol group was stopped at the fourth review on grounds of futility \u2013 the board were blinded to allocation and unaware that this was 1 mg Haloperidol group\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n21 centres across the Netherlands, including university and non-teaching hospitals\nJuly 2013 to December 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Age over 18 years without delirium and admitted to trial Intensive Care Unit with anticipated stay of at least 2 days\nExclusion: Delirium prior to inclusion, dementia, Parkinson disease, alcohol abuse, acute neurological disease, use of antipsychotics or history of psychiatric disease, prolonged QTc or \u201cclinically relevant ventricular arrhythmia\u201d, death expected within 2 days, pregnancy, intolerance to haloperidol, inability to consent\n15,882 screened, 1,796 were randomised and 1,789 were included in the primary analysis\nBaseline characteristics between groups were similar (1 mg vs 2 mg vs placebo):\n\nMean age: 66 vs 67 vs 67 years\nSurgical admission: 47% vs 46% vs 46%\nEmergency admission: 81% vs 82% vs 81%\nMechanical ventilation: 71% vs 68% vs 65%\nAPACHE 2 score: 20 vs 19 vs 19\nSepsis diagnosis: 30% vs 37% vs 33%\nPRE-DELIRIC score: 18 vs 19 vs 19\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nHaloperidol 1 mg\n\n1 mg Haloperidol administered three times daily\nReduced to 0.5 mg for patients over 80 years, or less than 50 kg, or had liver failure (bilirubin > 50 \u00b5mol/L)\n\n\nHaloperidol 2 mg\n\n2 mg Haloperidol administered three times daily\nReduced to 1 mg for patients over 80 years, or less than 50 kg, or had liver failure (bilirubin > 50 \u00b5mol/L)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\n0.9% sodium chloride administered three times daily\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nNon-pharmacological methods to prevent delirium were part of daily ICU care, and implementation was nearly 90%\n\nEarly mobilisation\nEfforts to improve circadian rhythm\nNoise reduction\nReduced sedation and avoidance of benzodiazepines\nHearing and visual aids\n\n\nDoses for all three groups appeared identical and were given 1 mL volume (or 0.5 mL for reduced doses as described above)\nInitial dose given as soon as possible and at least within 24 hours\nStudy drug given until day 28, or until ICU discharge, or until delirium occurred\nCAM-ICU was used to identify patients suffering from delirium\nUpon delirium occurring, the study medication was stopped and open-label haloperidol was recommended\nA standardised regime of increasing-decreasing haloperidol was given for hyperactive (agitated) delirium\n\nUp to 5 mg every 8 hours\nReduced by 50% on each day after resolution of delirium and stopped on day three if they remained free from delirium\nRescue medication could include midazolam, clonidine, propofol or dexmedetomidine\nHaloperidol could be administered intravenous, intramuscular or oral\n\n\nStudy medication was not restarted if delirium resolved or if the patient was readmitted to the ICU\n\nOutcome\n\nOnly the 2 mg Haloperidol group was compared against Placebo group, as the 1 mg Haloperidol group had been stopped early on grounds of futility\nPrimary outcome: There was no difference in survival rates between the two groups\n\nMedian time until death censored at 28 days:\n\n2 mg Haloperidol: 28 days\nPlacebo: 28 days\nHazard Ratio: 1.003 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.30)\n\n\n28-day mortality:\n\n2 mg Haloperidol: 16.67%\nPlacebo: 17.26%\nAbsolute Risk Reduction: 0.59% (95% CI -3.29% to 4.47%; P-value 0.7790)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nSurvival to 90 days did not differ between groups\nIncidence of delirium was not different\n\n2 mg Haloperidol: 33.3%\nPlacebo: 33.0%\n\n\nDuration of open-label haloperidol to treat delirium was not different\nDose of open-label haloperidol required to treat delirium was not different\nNo differences were identified in other outcome measures including duration of ventilation, unintended extubation, readmission rates or lengths of stay\nNo differences became apparent in per-protocol analysis\nAdverse events did not differ between groups\nNo interactions with any predefined subgroups were identified\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nProphylactic haloperidol therapy did not improve survival in critically ill patients at high risk of developing delirium\n\nStrengths\n\nAppropriate concealment of allocation sequence, randomisation strategy and blinding of group allocation, which strengthen the validity of these results\nMulti-centre design improves validity and generalisability to the wider population\nAppropriate safety and futility checks put in place with early termination of 1 mg Haloperidol group\n\nIt is unethical to continue research on humans in the knowledge that\u00a0either\u00a0the data will never be sufficient to answer the relevant hypothesis or that the intervention is harmful\n\n\nAppropriate intention-to-treat and sensitivity analysis of data\nTime-to-event analysis offers greater statistical power to detect a significant difference compared to an analysis of incidence of events at a fixed time point\n\nWeaknesses\n\nI doubt the biological plausibility that a small dose of prophylactic haloperidol could modify survival at 28 days\nThe power calculation assumed an effect size of 15% relative difference, which would also seem a biologically implausible effect size, even though it was based on a suitable observational study\nMedian survival at 28 days is not a useful statistical description in this trial\n\nThe\u00a0median describes the outcome of the middle patient, if they were lined up in numerical order of their outcome\nCensoring means that, in this case, if patients lived to 28 days and possibly beyond, their survival outcome was recorded as \u201c28\u201d\nSince more than 50% lived at least 28 days, the middle patient\u2019s result was therefore \u201c28\u201d, as described by the\u00a0median survival outcome in this trial\nThe survival rate was always likely to be more than 50% in this trial (corresponding to a mortality rate of less than 50%), so the\u00a0median survival to day 28 was always going to be \u201c28\u201d\nHowever, the Hazard Ratio describes the approximate rate of death over time and is an appropriate and useful description\n\n\nThe study sample only included Dutch hospitals, which limits the extrapolation to non-European populations\nNo differentiation was made between hypo-active and hyper-active delirium, so conclusions about these subgroups cannot be made\nData on delirium outcomes were not collected from 7 centres due to lack of research staff\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis was a methodologically sound and well conducted trial, which was based upon a hypothesis that lacked biological plausibility\nThe trial results confirm that Haloperidol 1 mg or 2 mg three times a day given prophylactically in critically ill adults will not prevent delirium, reduce delirium duration or modify mortality risk\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of Haloperidol on Survival Among
