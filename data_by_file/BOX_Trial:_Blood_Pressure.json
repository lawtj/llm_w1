This was based on a predicted mortality of 38%\n\nSetting\n\nConducted in 2 Tertiary Danish ICUs between March 2017 to December 2021\n\nPopulation\nInclusion Criteria\n\nOut of hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause\nSustained ROSC > 20mins\nUnconscious (GCS < 9)\n\n\u00a0\nExclusion Criteria\n\nFemales of childbearing potential (unless a negative HCG test can rule out pregnancy within the inclusion window)\nIn-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA)\nOHCA of presumed non-cardiac cause, e.g., after trauma or dissection/rupture of major artery OR cardiac arrest caused by initial hypoxia (i.e., drowning, suffocation, hanging)\nSuspected or confirmed acute intracranial bleeding\nSuspected or confirmed acute stroke\nUnwitnessed asystole\nKnown limitations in therapy and Do Not Resuscitate-order\nKnown disease making 180 days survival unlikely\n>4hours (240min)from ROSC to screening\nSystolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg despite fluid loading/vasopressor and/or inotropic medication intra-aortic balloon pump/axial flow device\nTemperature on admission<30\u00b0C\n\n\u00a0\n\n1196 patients assessed for eligibility\n\n188 not meeting inclusion criteria.\n\nYounger than 18 years of age = 9\nOHCA on non-cardiac origin, n=47\nROSC not sustained > 20 minutes, n=17\n\n\n206 with an exclusion criteria\n802 randomised\n\n403 High target BP group, 9 withdrew consent \uf0e0 ITT population of 393\n399 Low target BP group 3 withdrew consent \uf0e0 ITT population of 396\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nBaseline characteristics\nHigh BP target vs Low BP target \u00a0\u2013 very similar between the two groups\n\nMean age: 63 vs 62\nMale: 80% vs 81%\nCardiovascular history\n\nHypertension 45% vs 47%\nDiabetes 12% vs 16%\nMyocardial infarction 24% vs 20%\nAtrial Fibrillation 17% vs 15%\nHeart failure 17% vs 18%\nCOPD 8% vs 8%\nStroke 6% vs 9%\n\n\nCardiac Arrest Details\n\nShockable rhythm 86% vs 84%\nWitnessed arrest 86% vs 84%\nBystander CPR 88% vs 87%\nTime to ROSC 21 vs 21 minutes\nTime from arrest to randomisation 150 vs 154 minutes\n\n\nFinding and procedures on arrival to hospital\n\nST Elevation on ECG 44% vs 47%\nCoronary angiogram performed 93% vs 90%\npH 7.21 vs 7.22\nLactate 6.1 vs 5.6\n\n\n\nIntervention \n\n\n\nHigher MAP target\n\nTarget MAP of 77mmHg for duration of invasive blood pressure monitoring\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\n\n\nStandard MAP target\n\nTarget MAP of 63mmHg for duration of invasive blood pressure monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both groups\n\nProtocolised recommendations for achieving MAP with fluids followed by Noradrenaline and then Dopamine.\nTargeted temperature management at 36oC for 24 hours\nStandardised neurological assessment\n\nOutcomes\n\nNo significant difference across any outcomes\n\n\nSub-groups\n\nNo difference across any pre-specified subgroups for 90 day all-cause mortality\n\nAge > 64 HR 1.05 (95% CI 0.77-1.44)\nHypertension HR 1.15 (95% CI 0.81-1.62)\nRenal Impairment HR 0.95 (95% CI 0.39-2.30)\nCOPD HR 0.48 (95% CI 0.23-0.99)\nShockable rhythm HR 1.11 (95% CI 0.85-1.45)\n\n\n\nAdverse Events\n\nNumber of moderate and severe bleeding events was not different between groups\nNumber of units of packed red blood cells transfused during VA-ECMO was higher in the moderate hypothermia group\nNumber of nosocomial infections was not different between groups\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\nIn comatose survivors of out of hospital cardiac arrest a mean arterial blood pressure of 77 mm Hg as compared with 63 mm Hg did not result in a significant difference in the percent- age of patients who died or had severe disability or coma\u00a0\nStrengths\n\nInnovative design allowing for double blinding in a haemodynamics trial.\nGood treatment separation between groups (BP 10mmHg and Noradrenaline dose 0.038mcg/kg/min)\nEvent rate consistent with predicted reducing risk of type 2 error.\nWell-designed, multi-centre study performed in the emergency setting\nMinimal loss to follow up\nStandardised protocol for temperature regulation\nSimilar baseline characteristics between groups\n\nWeaknesses\n\nStudy only performed in two centres in one country which limits generalisability.\nSome may argue that the 10mmHg is not sufficient to difference in outcome\nLarge predicted effect size increases risk of type 2 error but no real signal in either direction\nUse of dopamine as inotrope of choice may reduce generalisability\nMOCA scores only available for 359 patients at 3 months making this data harder to interpret\nDid not mandate sedation hold on initial assessment\u00a0\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI will aim to maintain a mean arterial pressure of > 65mmHg for survivors of out of hospital as has been my current practice. It seems any value in this range is likely to be safe\n\nExternal Links \n\nNEJM \u2013 Blood pressure targets in out of hospital cardiac arrest\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Alastair Brown\nSummary date: 27th September 2022\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\n\n\n"
