JAMA 2017;\u00a0Published online May 21, 2017. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.4078\nClinical Question\n\nWhat is the discriminative accuracy of physicians and nurses in predicting 6-month mortality and functional outcomes of critically ill patients?\n\nBackground\n\nClinicians\u2019 abilities to discriminate between patients who will or will not develop unfavourable outcomes, other than mortality, are important for several reasons:\n\nknowledge of future function is important to ICU patients, their families, and clinicians\nmultidisciplinary family meetings commonly focus on function and quality of life\npredictions of future function may influence clinician behaviour, as physicians are more likely to offer the withdrawal of life support when they believe the patient will experience future dysfunction\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nProspective cohort study\nPhysicians\u2019 and nurses were asked to individually predict 6 patient outcomes (included mortality, independent living, ambulation and cognition) in ICU patients. Each outcome required two responses:\n\nWould the outcome be achieved? Yes or No\nConfidence\u00a0in each prediction using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not confident at all) to 5 (very confident)\nPredictions were completed within 24 hours of patient enrolment\nPhysicians were required to have been responsible for patient care for at least 2 calendar days; nurses were required to have one day of contact, owing to greater variability on their daily schedule and more frequent contact with patients on a given day\n\nPredictions were made by 47 physicians and 128 nurses\n\n\n\n\nFor each outcome, 8 operating characteristics were calculated separately for physicians\u2019 and nurses\u2019 predictions: sensitivity, specificity, C (concordance) statistic, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio (LR), negative LR, and diagnostic odds ratio\nIn-hospital mortality was determined by reviewing the electronic health record. If patients were not confirmed to be dead at 6 months, a trained research assistant unaware of the clinicians\u2019 baseline predictions attempted to contact survivors or their surrogate\u00a0via telephone or email to determine the patient\u2019s vital status and function. Patients were considered lost to follow-up after 5 failed contact attempts\nFor some outcomes, clinicians were asked to make predictions on the assumption that the patient was alive at 6 months\nA target sample size of 300 patients was chosen to provide 80% power to detect 95% CIs no wider than 20% around sensitivity and specificity if the operating characteristics were approximately 75%\n\nSetting\n\n5 ICU\u2019s (3 medical and 2 surgical) in 3 hospitals in the US\nOctober 2013 \u2013 May 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Patients who spent at least 3 days in the ICU and received mechanical ventilation for more than 48 consecutive hours, vasoactive infusions for more than 24 consecutive hours, or both\nExclusion: none specifically, beyond not meeting inclusion criteria\n303 patients enrolled\nBaseline characteristics: Median age 62; hospitalised in prior year 70%; preponderance of medical ICU patient\u2019s 63%;\u00a0admitting\u00a0diagnosis: 27% respiratory\u00a0failure, 22% sepsis; 18% post nonemergency surgery; 11% post emergency surgery\n\nIntervention\n\nNone\n\nControl\n\nN/A\n\nOutcome \u2013 overall predictions: Yes or No\n\nIn-hospital mortality\n\nPositive LR:\u00a0physicians 4.81;\u00a0nurses 4.71\nNegative LR:\u00a0physicians 0.64;\u00a0nurses 0.61\n\n\n\n\n\nMortality at 6 months:\u00a0physicians predictions were statistically significantly better than nurses\n\nPositive LR:\u00a0physicians 5.91;\u00a0nurses: 4.23\nNegative LR:\u00a0physicians 0.41;\u00a0nurses 0.56\nC statistic (the area under the receiver operator curve), 0.76 [95% CI 0.72-0.81] vs\u00a00.69 [95% CI 0.64-0.74]; P=0.02\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nunable to return to original residence at 6 months\n\nPositive LR: physicians 3.20;\u00a0nurses: 2.06\nNegative LR:\u00a0physicians 0.49;\u00a0nurses: 0.51\n\n\nunable to toilet independently\u00a0at 6 months\n\nPositive LR: physicians 6.00; nurses: 2.61\nNegative LR:\u00a0physicians 0.51;\u00a0nurses: 0.48\n\n\nunable to ambulate up 10 stairs independently\u00a0at 6 months\n\nPositive LR: physicians 2.18; nurses 2.04\nNegative LR: physicians 0.51; nurses 0.48\n\n\nabnormal cognitive function (ability to \u201cremember most things, think clearly, and solve day-to-day problems\u201d)\u00a0at 6 months\n\nPositive LR: physicians 2.36; nurses 1.50\nNegative LR: physicians 0.75; nurses 0.88\n\n\n\nOutcome \u2013 When confident in each prediction\n\nIn-hospital mortality: when physicians and nurses predicted a patient would die during their hospital admission, there was a \u2018modest shift\u2019 in the probability of this occurring.

This will clearly influence the clinicians predictive accuracy\nThese data apply only to predictions made on ICU days 3 to 6\nThe confidence intervals surrounding the likelihood ratio\u2019s are wide because of small sample sizes (43% of patients had died by 6 months)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhen ICU physicians and nurses agreed in their predictions and both were confident, the discrimination was typically maximised. Combined\u00a0with\u00a0objective clinical variables and illness severity scores, this is likely to have an even higher discriminative accuracy for predicting long-term outcomes\nI\u2019m reassured about predicting mortality after I\u2019ve cared for a patient for 48 hours but I will no longer make predictions for the family regarding cognition. I will continue to be cautious about making any prediction before 48 hours, but this study doesn\u2019t address this early time period\nFurther research is needed to better understand and refine predictive outcome modelling\n\nExternal Links\n\n[abstract]\u00a0Discriminative Accuracy of Physician and Nurse Predictions for Survival and Functional Outcomes 6 Months After an ICU Admission\n[further reading]\u00a0Likelihood Ratios CEBM\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Steve Mathieu\nSummary date: 13th June 2017\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
