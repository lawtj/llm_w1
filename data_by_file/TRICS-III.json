However, patients who were admitted after cardiac surgery were excluded from this study\nThe evidence in post-cardiac surgery patients is limited by small, poor quality trials. The concern has been that a restrictive strategy may increase the risk of anaemia-induced tissue hypoxia\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n1:1 ratio of restrictive vs liberal strategy\nAllocation concealment (central web-based allocation)\nPermuted blocks of varying size, stratified to centre\nUnblinded, although the outcomes were evaluated by those unaware of the trial-group assignment\nThe primary analysis was a per-protocol analysis; excluding patients who were withdrawn from the trial by treating physician, patients who withdrew consent and those that had a protocol adherence of less than 90%.\u00a0 Non-adherence was measured by counting the number of non-adherent trigger events and non-adherent red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, as a proportion of the total number of hemoglobin measurements recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Adherence is 1- non adherence\nA modified intention-to-treat analysis was also conducted\nPower calculation: The event rate of the primary composite outcome was assumed to be 10%. Partway through the trial, the power of the trial was increased from 85% to 90%, which required a sample size of 5000 patients. The aim was to detect non-inferiority at a one-sided alpha of 0.025, with a non-inferiority margin of 3%\n\nSetting\n\n19 countries, 73 sites\nRandomisation from January 20th 2014 to March 20th 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: patients 18 years or older undergoing cardiac surgery with a pre-operative EuroSCORE I of 6 or higher (the EuroSCORE I is a validated scoring system that is predictive of in-hospital mortality)\nExclusion\n\nunable to receive or declined blood products\npre-operative autologous donation program\nheart transplant surgery\nsurgery for ventricular assist device\npregnant or lactating\n\n\n5243 were randomized; 54 did not have surgery, 63 did not have cardiopulmonary bypass, 34 withdrew before surgery to leave 5092 in the modified intention-to-treat analysis\n4860 patients were included in the per protocol analysis (excluding 8 in each group where intervention was discontinued or consent withdrawn AND 117 in the restrictive group and 99 in the liberal group where adherence to the protocol was <90%)\nBaseline demographics similar in both groups\n\nIntervention\n\nPatients in the restrictive group received a red-cell transfusion if the haemoglobin concentration was less than 7.5g/dL intra-operatively or post-operatively\n\nControl\n\nPatients in the liberal group received a red-cell transfusion if the haemoglobin concentration was less than 9.5g/dL intra-operatively or post-operatively or less than 8.5g/dL in the non-ICU ward\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nHaemoglobin level was measured pre-operatively, intra-operatively and post-operatively at specified intervals. If the haemoglobin fell below the threshold, 1 unit of red cells was administered followed by reassessment of the level\nAll other aspects of care were directed by the treating medical teams\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: A restrictive transfusion threshold was non-inferior to the liberal transfusion group for\u00a0a composite outcome of death, myocardial infarct, new onset dialysis requiring renal failure, during the hospitalisation (from the start of surgery until either hospital discharge or 28 days after surgery (whichever came first)\n\nPer-protocol analysis:11.4% in the restrictive group compared to 12.5% in liberal group (absolute risk difference = -1.11%; 95% CI, -2.93 to 0.72, OR 0.90; 95% CI -2.93 to 0.72)\nModified intention to treat analysis (which included patients even if there was <90 % non-adherence to the protocol) also showed non-inferiority in the restrictive group (12.3% vs 12.9%)\n\n\nSecondary outcome: No statistical differences in:\n\nEach of the components of the composite outcomes\nLOS in ICU and hospital\nDuration of mechanical ventilation\nProlonged cardiac output state\nInfection\nBowel infarction\nAcute Kidney Injury\nSeizure\nDelirium\nEncephalopathy\n\n\nIn the restrictive group, 52.3% were transfused and those transfused averaged 2 units. In the liberal group, 72.6% were transfused and those transfused averaged 3 units of red-cells.\nSubgroup analysis based on age (>75 years) showed the restrictive-threshold group was associated with a lower risk of the composite primary outcome than the liberal-threshold group (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.54-0.89 p=0.004)\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe restrictive transfusion strategy is non-inferior to the liberal transfusion strategy in cardiac surgery patients with a moderate-to-high risk of death with regards to a composite outcome of death and major disability\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre\nAllocation concealment\nComplete follow-up\nPer-protocol and modified intention-to-treat analysis\nBlinding of investigators assessing primary outcome, patients were not actively told about their treatment assignment\nPatients were randomised before surgery meaning that the effect of two transfusion strategies was examined for the whole of their journey as a cardiac surgery patient\nThe sample population were a sick group of cardiac surgery patients, so treatment effect, if any would likely be more obvious than low-risk cardiac surgery patients\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNon-blinding of clinical staff administering the blood\nThe per-protocol analysis excluded patients where adherence to the protocol was <90%. This could potentially pull potentially sicker patients out of the analysis of the primary outcome, impacting the power of the study. The authors did a modified intention to treat analysis which did include these patients though and still demonstrated non-inferiority in the restrictive strategy\nThis trial is in patients with moderate-to-high risk of death during cardiac surgery and is not necessarily generalisable to those with low-risk cardiac surgery\nIt is difficult to know the significance of the subgroup analyses from this trial but it is certainly hypothesis generating, particularly that older patients may fair worse than younger patients with liberal transfusion\nThe trial does not provide information as to whether a transfusion threshold even lower than 7.5g/dL would be safe\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial adds to the growing body of evidence that restrictive transfusion protocols are not harmful in critically ill patients\nThis study demonstrates that post-cardiac surgery patients can safely be managed with haemoglobins as low as 7.5g/dL\n\nExternal Links\n\n[abstract] TRICS III: Restrictive or Liberal Red-Cell Transfusion for Cardiac Surgery\u00a0\n[further reading] Supplementary material\n[further reading]\u00a0The Bottom line summaries on transfusion\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford \u2013 @celiabradford\nSummary date: November 22nd 2017\nPeer-review editor: Steve Mathieu\n\n\n"
