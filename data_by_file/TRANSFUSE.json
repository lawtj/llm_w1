NEJM 2017; September 27. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1707572\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients requiring transfusion, does the transfusion of the freshest available red cells compared to standard care impact on patient mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nWhen blood is stored there is concern that the storage lesion impacts on patient safety. Red cells become spiculated over time impacting on their transit through capillary beds and oxygen carriage. Hospital donation services need guidance as to safe storage times. There is some variation across centres ranging\u00a0 from 35-42 days. In addition it is not known if certain subgroups of patients would benefit from receiving fresher blood compared with long-term storage of blood.\nThere have been several studies investigating whether fresh blood is superior to blood near its used by date. The ABLE trial looked at ICU patients and randomised them to receive blood that was less than 8 days old or older blood. However, there were several limitations to this study, including a relatively small sample size and exclusion of more than 700 potentially eligible patients due to lack of availability of \u2018fresh blood.\u2019\nThe INFORM trial was a large trial of over 10000 all hospital patients with a subgroup of critically ill patients. Similarly patients were randomized to fresh or old blood. The critically ill subgroup had a lower than expected mortality making it difficult to generalize the results to a sick ICU population.\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial 1:1 allocation\nDouble blind (concealment of blood collection and expiration dates)\nComputer-generated allocation concealment\nIntention to treat analysis\nICU patients; prespecified supgroups\n\nAPACHE III with analysis of death above and below the median\nABO blood group; O vs non-O\nSOFA\n\n\nLogistic regression to determine heterogeneity between intervention and control groups\nFurther secondary analysis\n\nanalysis of impact of duration of storage independent to group allocation in quartiles and as a continuous variable\n\n\nSample size calculation: 4664 patients required to detect an absolute difference of 4.2% for 90 day day mortality, from a baseline of 28%, with a false positive rate of 10% and a false negative rate of 5%.\n\nSetting\n\n59 sites in 5 countries (Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Finland, Saudi Arabia)\nDates: November 2012 \u2013 December 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: patients hospitalized in ICU expected to stay at least 24 hours, who need transfusion (as decided by caring doctors) of at least one RBC unit\nExclusion\n\nAge < 18\nPrevious RBC transfusion during current admission\nTransplant or haematologic diseases\nPregnancy\nCardiac surgery patients (due to low mortality rates)\nDeath imminent (< 24 hours)\nObjection by treating physician\nKnown patient objection to receive transfusion\n\n\n4994 randomized; 2490 assigned to short-term storage blood, 2504 assigned to long-term storage blood\nComparing baseline characteristics of control vs. intervention group:\n\nBaseline characteristics were similar although the age differed by 1 year which was a statistically significant difference (due to the large sample size). The data was therefore analyzed with an adjustment to this age difference.\nNumber of red cell units transfused: 4.1 vs. 4.0\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nTransfusion of the freshest available blood\n\nMean storage duration of transfused blood 11.8+-5.3 days\n\n\n\nControl\n\nTransfusion of the oldest available compatible blood (<36 days old, or <42 days in Australia/Saudi Arabia)\n\nMean storage duration of transfused blood 22.4 +-7.5\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nBlood was leukodepleted\nAll other management was as per the ICU treating teams\nThe mean transfusion threshold was 77.4g/L in the short-term storage group and 77.3g/L in the long-term group.\nAfter ICU discharge if patients required further transfusion the original allocation assigned would be adhered to.\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Death at 90 days \u2013 no significant difference\n\nShort-term storage 24.8%. Long-term storage 24.1%. unadjusted OR 1.04 (0.91-1.18, p=0.57), adjusted OR 1.05 (0.92-1.21, p=0.46)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: (Short-term vs Long-term blood)\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\n28 or 180 day mortality\nPersistent Organ Dysfunction combined with death at day 28\nDays alive and free of mechanical ventilation at Day 90\nDays alive and free of renal replacement therapy at Day 90\nBlood stream infection in ICU\nLength of ICU and hospital stay\n\n\nFebrile non-haemolytic tranfusion reactions; occurred more frequently in the short-term storage group (123 events {5%} vs 88 events {3.6%}), absolute risk difference = 1.4% (95% CI, 1.07-1.88, p=0.01)\nAnalysis of quartiles depending on age of transfused blood and independent of group allocation: no significant difference\n\n\nSub-group analysis\n\nAnalysis of patients with the higher risk of death (APACHE III > than the median of 21.5%):\n\n90 day mortality significantly greater in the short-term storage group\n\n37.7% vs. 34%, OR 1.18 (95% CI, 1.00-1.39, p = 0.05)\n\n\n\n\nABO-group transfusion: no significant difference\nSOFA score <7 or >7: no significant difference\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThere is no difference in 90 day mortality in patients transfused the freshest available red cells versus standard issue\n\nPatients who had short-term storage blood had more febrile non-haemolytic transfusion reactions\nPatients who had short-term storage blood with greater than median APACHE III risk of death had increased mortality\n\n\n\nStrengths\n\nLarge sample size, meticulous design and execution of the trial ensure these results are the best evidence we have for this clinical question\nNear complete follow-up and analysis adjusted to baseline difference of age\nOnly 1% of patients did not receive the blood they were suppose to\nMulti-centred and Multi-country\nThe age of the blood in the groups was significantly separated by 10.6 days meaning the trial achieved what it aimed to\n\nWeaknesses\n\n1353 eligible patients did not undergo randomisation\nThe finding of more febrile non-haemolytic reactions in the fresh blood group should be considered exploratory\nThe finding of higher mortality in the sicker patient group is of unknown significance\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis important study confirms that there is no benefit gained from using the freshest blood available in the blood bank for transfusing critically ill patients. Conversely it also confirms that there is no harm from using the oldest blood in the blood bank to transfuse critically ill patients\nAlthough this study will not change my practice it puts the question of \u201cIs Fresh Best\u201d to rest\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0TRANSFUSE: Age of Red Cells for Transfusion and Outcomes in Critically Ill Adults\n[further reading]\u00a0ABLE\n[further reading]\u00a0INFORM trial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford\nSummary date: 28th September 2017\nPeer-review editor: Segun Olusanya\n\n\n"
