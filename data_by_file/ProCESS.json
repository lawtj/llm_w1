N Engl J Med 2014; 370:1683-1693.\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients with sepsis, does protocol-based care compared to usual care reduce death within 60 days?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial of 3 groups in 1:1:1 ratio\nNon-blinded design\n\nSetting\n\n31 academic hospitals in US\nMarch 2008 to May 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: adults arriving in the emergency department (ED) with suspected sepsis (refractory hypotension or lactate > 4 mmol/l with\u00a0two or more SIRS criteria)\nExclusion: if another primary diagnosis was present, such as acute myocardial infarction\n12,707 screened of which 1,351 randomised\n\nIntervention\n\nEarly goal-directed therapy (EGDT) group: strict protocolised care (based on Rivers study) for 6 hours with dedicated doctor, nurse and research assistant that provided prompts\nProtocol-based standard therapy group: relaxed protocolised care (based upon published expert opinions) for 6 hours with dedicated doctor, nurse and research assistant that provided prompts\n\nControl\n\nUsual care group: no extra staffing, with all care as directed by bedside physician for 6 hours. Research assistant collected data but provided no prompting.\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: there were no differences in 60-day mortality between groups\n\nEGDT 21.0%; Protocol-based standard therapy 18.2%; Usual care 18.9%. (P values 0.31 \u2013 0.89)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: there were no differences in 90-day or 1-year mortality between groups, or markers of significant morbidity.\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusion\n\nNo significant advantage, with respect to mortality or morbidity, of protocol-based resuscitation over bedside care that was provided according to the treating physician\u2019s judgement.\n\nStrengths\n\nWell designed, pragmatic method\nMethods and statistical analysis defined and published a priori.\nRecruited adequate numbers as planned for 80% power to detect 6\u20137% mortality reduction with alpha 0.05.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nChanged inclusion criteria during trial (reduced fluid bolus required before meeting \u201crefractory hypotension\u201d criteria), but mean volume used was within Rivers\u2019 original definition of 20\u201330 ml/kg.\nMortality ~20% but initial power calculation based on 30\u201346%, therefore interim adjustment made and recruitment target reduced.\nAdherence to protocol was 88.1% in EGDT group and 95.6% in protocol-based standard therapy group. Although pragmatic, this is not perfect and may reduce between group differences.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAdults with sepsis in the ED have ~20% 60-day mortality and providing care by a dedicated team following either a strict or relaxed protocol makes no difference to this.\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf not available without subscription / abstract / doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1401602\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\nLilly.
