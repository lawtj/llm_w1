NEJM 2023. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2214322\nClinical Question\n\nIn haematology or ICU patients with platelet counts between 10,000 and 50,000 per mm3, is receiving no prophylactic platelets non inferior compared to the administration of 1u platelets in order to reduce the risk of catheter-related bleeding?\n\nBackground\n\nCVC placement and thrombocytopenia are both common among haematology and ICU patients\nRetrospective studies have suggested that with USS guidance CVC insertion is safe even with a platelet count < 20,000 per mm3\nTransfusion guidelines regarding platelet-count thresholds before the placement of a CVC offer conflicting recommendations regarding transfusion threshold:\n\n<20,000: British Society of Hematology\u00a0\n<40 \u2013 5000: American Society of Oncology\n<50,000: AAGBI for \u201cother major surgery or invasive procedures\u201d,\n\n\nPlatelet transfusion is not without associated morbidity, alongside being a scarce and expensive resource\n\nVarious adverse effects include TRALI, TACO, allergic reaction and alloimmunization\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, open label, non-inferiority trial\nNon-inferiority margin set as 2.5% increase in the absolute risk of Grade 2-4 bleeding\n\ni.e. if rate of bleeding was < 2.5% greater in no transfusion arm then this would be deemed non-inferior\n\n\nOccurrence of bleeding and any treatments recorded immediately post CVC placement and at 1- and 24-hours post insertion\n1:1 randomization to transfusion vs no transfusion\n\nStratified according to the trial centre and catheter type (large-bore dialysis catheter or regular CVC)\n\n\nUnblinded for patient but if possible the operator was unaware of the trial-group assignment\nIdeally informed consent taken prior to randomisation, but if emergency (ie. in ICU) then deferred consent allowed\nSample size calculation required 196 CVC insertions in each group:\n\nBased on assumption that in transfusion group 1% will have Grade 2 bleeding and no patients will have Grade 3 or 4 bleeding\n80% power to detect the non-inferiority of the non-transfusion strategy with an alpha level of 0.05\nNo loss to follow-up accounted for\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n10 hospitals in the Netherlands (7 academic and 3 general)\n\nIncluded 8 hematology wards and 7 ICUs (Figure S2a)\n\n\nFebruary 2016 \u2013 March 2022\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nPatients who had a platelet count of 10,000 to 50,000 per mm3\nwithin 24 hours before the procedure\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nTherapeutic anticoagulation\nA history of congenital or acquired coagulation factor deficiency or bleeding risk\nINR>1.5\n\nChanged to INR > 3.0 during study due to new evidence\n\n\nPrior inclusion within 24 hours (the authors allowed multiple inclusions of patients who had been already included in the study, as long as each procedure was performed 24h apart.)\n\n\nBaseline Characteristics\u00a0\n\n411 CVC placements randomized \u2013> 393 CVC placements (358 patients) were included in ITT analysis\n\n18 excluded due to withdrawal or no deferred consent\n\n\nNo major difference in baseline characteristics:\n\nComparing transfusion vs no transfusion:\nAge: 58 vs 59\nFemale: 34 vs 38%\nMedian platelet count: 30,000 vs 30,000\nMedian INR: 1.1 vs 1.1\nMedian APTT: 29 vs 31\nICU: 43 vs 44%\nRegular CVC (as opposed to dialysis catheter): 82 vs 84%\nTunneled: 11 vs 10%\nIJ: 50 vs 50%\nSubclavian 38 vs 38%\nPrior platelet transfusion < 6 hrs before randomisation: 9 vs 10%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nTransfusion 1u platelets prophylactically\n\nControl\n\nNo transfusion\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nUltrasound guided CVC\nOperator needed to have performed at least 50 CVC placements\nIf possible, all catheters were placed approximately 1h after randomization\nOtherwise, CVCs were placed according to local clinical practice\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nGrade 2-4 catheter-related bleeding:\n\nTransfusion 4.8% (transfusion) vs 11.9% (no transfusion)\nAbsolute risk reduction of 7.1% (90% CI: 1.3 to 17.8%), RR 2.45 (90% CI 1.27 \u2013 4.70)\n\n\n\n\nSelected secondary outcomes:\n\nComparing transfusion vs no transfusion\nSignificant difference in transfusion group in:\n\nPlatelet count at 1h and 24h after CVC placement\n\n54,000 vs 26,000 after 1h;

however, analysis showed no increased rates of bleeding in unblinded group\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAlongside paying meticulous attention to insertion technique and the high rates of post CVC platelet transfusion in the no transfusion group, I will prophylactically transfuse if the platelet count is < 50,000 per mm3\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Platelet Transfusion before CVC Placement in Patients with Thrombocytopenia\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Ryo Ueno\nSummary date: 14th July 2023\nPeer-review editor: George Walker\nPicture by: Thavis3D /Unsplash\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
