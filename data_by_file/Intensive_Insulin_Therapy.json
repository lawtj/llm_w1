NEJM 2001; 345: 1359-1367. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa011300\nClinical Question\n\nIn post-operative patients requiring mechanical ventilation, does intensive insulin therapy compared to conventional insulin therapy reduce mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nHyperglycaemia associated with critical illness is common and may be associated with complications such as polyneuropathy, increased susceptibility to infection and worsening organ dysfunction\nGlycaemic control after myocardial infarct has been shown to improve outcomes\nThis trial investigated if tight glycaemic control in critical illness may also improve outcomes, but it should be read in combination with NICE-SUGAR that followed\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\nSingle-centre, predominantly post-operative intensive care unit\nAllocation performed using sealed envelopes\nStratification in blocks of 10 according to the \u201ctype of critical illness\u201d: cardiac surgery vs non-cardiac surgery\nClinical staff were not blinded to allocation\n\nOutcome assessors including laboratory staff, electophysiologists and pathologists were blinded to allocation\n\n\nPlanned to recruit 2,500 patients\n\nPowered to detect at 0.05 alpha significance level (beta error or Power level not specified):\n\nAbsolute risk reduction in mortality of 5% for those staying 5 days or more in Intensive Care\nAbsolute risk reduction in mortality of 2% for all Intensive Care patients\n\n\n\n\nTrial was terminated early after fourth planned interim study as threshold of P < 0.01 had been met\nAnalysis was \u2018intention to treat\u2019\n\nSetting\n\nSingle Intensive Care Unit in Leuven, Belgium\nFebruary 2000 to January 2001\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: all adults requiring mechanical ventilation\nExclusion: Moribund; do-not-resuscitate order in place; participating in other trial\n1562 screened, 1548 recruited (14 exclusions)\nBaseline demographics and measured variables were similar between groups\n\nGender: 71% male\nAdmission: >90% surgical, 63% for cardiac surgery\nMedian APACHE 2 score: 9\nExisting diabetes: 13%\nReceived insulin:\n\nIntensive insulin therapy group: 98.7%\nConventional insulin therapy group: 39.2%\n\n\nMorning blood glucose:\n\nIntensive insulin therapy group: 103 mg/dl (5.7 mmol/l)\nConventional insulin therapy group: 153 mg/dl (8.5 mmol/l)\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nIntensive Insulin Therapy\n\nInsulin infusion commenced if blood glucose exceeded 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l)\nInfusion titrated to maintain blood glucose in the range 80 \u2013 110 mg/dl (4.4 \u2013 6.1 mmol/l)\n\nIf > 140 mg/dl: Increased by 1.0-2.0 U/hr\nIf 121 to 140 mg/dl: Increased by 0.5 to 1.0 U/hr\nIf 111 to 120 mg/dl: Increased by 0.1 to 0.5 U/hr\nIf 81 to 110 mg/dl: No change\nIf 61 to 80 mg/dl: Insulin reduced by proportional amount\nIf 41 to 60 mg/dl: Insulin was stopped\nIf < 40 mg/dl: Insulin was stopped and 10 g intravenous glucose was administered\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nConventional Insulin Therapy\n\nInsulin infusion commenced if blood glucose exceeded 215 mg/dl (11.9 mmol/l)\nInfusion titrated to maintain blood glucose in the range 180 \u2013 200 mg/dl (10.0 \u2013 11.1 mmol/l)\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nInsulin was made as 50 units of Actrapid HM (Novo-Nordisk, Denmark) in 50 ml 0.9% NaCl\nMaximum insulin rate was arbitrarily set at 50 units/hr\nOn discharge from Critical Care, the \u2018conventional\u2019 target was used whilst still requiring intravenous insulin (180 \u2013 200 mg/dl [10.0 \u2013 11.1 mmol/l])\nInfusion adjustments were made according to a strict protocol based upon results from whole-blood arterial sampling taken 1-4 hourly depending on stability\nNutrition was standardised and the same between groups\n\nIntravenous glucose 200-300 g/day on day of admission\nTransition to either enteral, mixed enteral-parenteral or total parenteral feeding from day after surgery\nTotal enteral feeding was primary aim and attempted as early as possible\nAim was 20 \u2013 30 non-protein kcal/kg/day (including 20 \u2013 40% from lipids and 0.13 \u2013 0.26 g/kg/day nitrogen)\n\n\nSuitability to leave Critical Care was decided when no organ support was required and two-thirds of caloric requirement was provided enterically\n\nThis was to avoid any bias on secondary outcomes due to delayed discharges to a ward\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Mortality from any cause\n\nIntensive Insulin Therapy group: 4.6%\nConventional Insulin Therapy group: 8.0%\nAbsolute Risk Reduction: 3.47% (95% CI 1.06% to 5.88%; P = 0.0064)\nNumber needed to treat: 29\nFragility Index: 7\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nIn hospital mortality was lower in the intensive insulin therapy group\nLength of stay in ICU was improved by intensive insulin therapy but overall hospital length of stay was not different\nNeed for prolonged ventilation or RRT was reduced by intensive insulin therapy but haemodynamic support requirement was not different between groups\nCritical illness polyneuropathy was less common in the intensive insulin therapy, however this may be biased by the reduced length of stay and therefore the reduced assessment rate in the intensive insulin therapy group\nInflammatory markers, incidence of bloodstream infections and antibiotic prescribing were monitored\n\nEpisodes of sepsis were lower in the intensive insulin therapy group\nInflammatory markers were less deranged in the intensive insulin therapy group\nProlonged antibiotic use was more common in the conventional insulin therapy group\n\n\nThe proportion of patients requiring red cell transfusion was not different between groups, however the median number of units transfused was lower in the intensive insulin therapy group\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nExogenous insulin with tight control of glucose not higher than 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) reduces mortality and morbidity in critically ill patients in a surgical intensive care unit\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\nConcealed allocation\nBlinding of outcome assessment and protocolisation of care for unblinded clinicians\nAppropriate statistical analysis and adjustment for multiple interim analysis\nVery low P-value and moderately high Fragility Index suggests these findings are very unlikely to have occurred by random chance\nManuscript reports excellent protocol adherence, but specific data not presented\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAll details of power calculation not presented, but less relevant given statistical difference was found\nEarly termination may have led to false positive conclusion (as demonstrated by ADRENAL trial where first interim analysis demonstrated significant benefit but this was later found to be false after complete recruitment)\nAllocation envelopes not described as \u2018opaque\u2019 although probably were\n\nGold standard now is online web-based randomisation, which is considered better than envelope strategy\n\n\nSingle-centre, surgical intensive care unit with low acuity patients significantly limits the generalisability of these findings to other mixed or medical intensive care units\nIncidence of harm, from hypoglycaemia for example, was not presented within the manuscript\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial found significant benefit from intensive insulin therapy\nHowever, this was a single centre with a sample population of mostly post (cardiac) surgery patients, so the external validity is of concern\nGiven this concern and the subsequent findings of NICE-SUGAR, intensive insulin therapy cannot be recommended\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Intensive Insulin Therapy in Critically Ill Patients\n[further reading]\u00a0NICE-SUGAR summary\n[further reading]\u00a0Glucose Control in ICU\u00a0by LITFL\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Duncan Chambler\nSummary date: 30 March 2018\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\n\n\n"
