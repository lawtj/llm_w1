NEJM 2017; published online 21st March.\u00a0doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1616325\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients undergoing cardiac surgery with left ventricular dysfunction, does levosimendan compared to placebo reduce mortality?\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, randomised trial\nPlacebo-controlled, parallel group design\nComputer generated permuted block randomisation sequence, stratifying according to study centre\nConcealed allocation using opaque, sealed envelopes\nBlinding of patients, clinicians and study personnel\nPowered at 80% with two-sided alpha significance defined at 0.05\n\nRequiring 435 patients per group (set at 500 to allow for losses)\nExpected mortality of 10% in\u00a0control group\u00a0and 5% in levosimendan group (based on meta-analysis of small trials)\n\n\nTerminated after 2nd interim analysis\u00a0on grounds of futility\n\nSetting\n\n14 cardiac surgery centres in Italy, Russia and Brazil\nNovember 2009 \u2013 April 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\u00a0Patients scheduled for cardiac surgery with peri-operative cardiovascular dysfunction\n\nPre-operative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 25%\nPre-operative intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)\nIntra- or post-operative (within\u00a024 hours) IABP or significant inotropic requirement\n\n\nExclusion:\u00a0Adverse reaction to study drug; levosimendan administration in previous 30 days; kidney or liver transplant; liver cirrhosis; ECMO; not for resuscitation order\n6478 screened; 4725 consented pre-operatively; 647 met inclusion criteria; 506 randomised (126 excluded at discretion of attending physician); all 506 analysed (none lost to follow-up)\nBaseline characteristics were similar between groups (levosimendan vs placebo)\n\nMedian age: 66 yrs vs 66 yrs\nPrevious cardiac surgery: 18% vs 14%\nCardiogenic shock: 2.4% vs 2.7%\nMedian LVEF: 50% vs 50%\nFirst reason for trial inclusion\n\nPre-op LVEF < 50%: 4.4% vs 4.3%\nIABP: 20.2% vs 17.1%\nIntra-op high-dose inotropes: 13.3% vs 10.9%\nPost-op high-dose inotropes: 62.1% vs 67.8%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nLevosimendan infusion\n\nInitially 0.05 \u00b5g/kg/min\nTitrated at attending physician\u2019s discretion up to 0.2 \u00b5g/kg/min\nContinued for up to 48 hours or until ICU discharge\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo infusion\n\nIndistinguishable from levosimendan infusion\nConsisted of yellow vitamin mix with no cardiovascular effect\nTitrated and continued in same way as levosimendan\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll clinical decisions, except for the study drug, were at the treating physician\u2019s discretion\nAn advisory flowchart provided guidance for inotropic management\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Mortality at 30 days was not different between the groups\n\nLevosimendan 12.9% vs Placebo 12.8%\nAbsolute risk reduction -0.1% (95% CI -5.7 to 5.9, P=0.97)\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\u00a0There were no significant differences in the secondary outcomes\n\nSurvival over time: hazard ratio 1.02 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.59, P=0.94)\nRequirement of renal replacement therapy: Levo 9.7% vs Placebo 12.8%\nMedian duration of mechanical ventilation: Levo 19 hours vs Placebo 21 hours\nMedian hospital stay: Levo 14 days vs Placebo 14 days\nInterruptions due to adverse events: Levo 3.8% vs Placebo 1.6%\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nA low-dose infusion of levosimendan did not improve survival in patients with left ventricular dysfunction undergoing cardiac surgery compared to a placebo\n\nStrengths\n\nAppropriate methodology for study question\nExcellent methods of randomisation, concealment of allocation and blinding, which will minimise biases and provide good internal validity\nBroad inclusion criteria compared to other trials investigating levosimendan in cardiac surgery, improving the generalisability of the results\nEthically appropriate early termination\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDosage of levosimendan is smaller than other trials\n\nThe lack of routine cardiac output data collection means that the physiological efficacy of this smaller dose cannot be shown\n\n\nThe wide confidence intervals do not exclude a clinically relevant absolute risk reduction of 5% \u2013 is this a \u2018negative\u2019 trial or a \u2018null\u2019 trial?\n\nThe authors designed the\u00a0study to attempt to demonstrate an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 5%, but the study was terminated early as\u00a0this trial would not have been able to demonstrate this with the remaining intended recruitment\nThe 95% CI -5.7 to 5.9 so there may be a clinically relevant benefit (or harm) from levosimendan (although it appears unlikely)\nConcluding that there is no clinically relevant difference may be a type 2 error (false negative)\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients undergoing cardiac surgery with peri-operative left ventricular dysfunction, it appears that a low-dose infusion of levosimendan is not beneficial\nAlthough there is a possibility of a type 2 error (false negative) in this conclusion, this finding is in keeping with other levosimendan trials\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Levosimendan for Hemodynamic Support after Cardiac Surgery\n[further reading]\u00a0LEVO-CTS summary by TBL\n[further reading]\u00a0LeoPARDS summary by TBL\n[further reading]\u00a0Levosimendan by LITFL\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Duncan Chambler\nSummary date:\u00a012 April 2017\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0Adrian Wong\n\n\n"
