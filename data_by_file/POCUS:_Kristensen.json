Anaesthesia 2016 DOI: 10.1111/anae.13465\nClinical Question\n\nIn medically-qualified anaesthetists, does the use of the transverse ultrasound technique compared to the longitudinal orientation result in faster identification of the cricothyroid membrane?\n\nDesign\n\nSingle centre, prospective, randomised study\nUnblinded\nRandomisation by computer-generated number sequence\nVideo recordings to ensure accurate timings obtained\nPower calculation based on\u00a0ability to detect a one-third difference between the group assuming a mean time to locate the cricothyroid membrane of 55.4 seconds (based on previous work)\n\nalpha-level 0.05, 90% power\n40 anaesthetists\u00a0required\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nSingle hospital in\u00a0Copenhagen, Denmark\n26 November 2015 \u2013 26 December 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nClinically-active, medically-qualified anaesthetists\nCertified or in-training\n\n\n42 anaesthetists participated\n\n10 in training\n37 would use US at least weekly\n40 have never used US examination for airway management prior to study\n\n\n\nCommon intervention\n\nAnaesthetists provided training in\u00a02 techniques by:\n\n20 minute e-learning module\n30 minute didactic lecture\n10 minute hands on practice with airway ultrasound expert\n\n\nEach anaesthetist would perform US examination in 1 of 2 obese patient\nEach anaethetist performed US guided localisation with both methods, with the sequence of methods randomly allocated\n\nTransverse (TAX)\n\nProbe placed transversely over neck\nTACA (Thyroid cartilage, Airline i.e. cricothyroid membrane, Cricoid cartilage) technique to identify\nVideo\n\nLongitudinal (LAX)\n\nProbe place longitudinally over neck\nVideo\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Time to identification of cricothyroid membrane\n\nFaster in TAX compared to LAX (24 secs vs 37.6 secs, p = 0.0003)\n\n\nSecondary outcome: Success rate of identification\n\nNo difference (90% success rate in identification of cricothyroid membrane overall)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe cricothyroid membrane could be identified using ultrasound technique, either longitudinal or transverse orientation, and should be mastered and utilised by anaesthetists in cases where the cricothyroid membrane cannot be identified by landmarks or palpation.\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\nComprehensive training programme for subjects\nComparison between 2 widely recognised techniques for ultrasound-guided cricothyroid identification\nMajority of subjects although familiar with US had never used it for airway management\n2 point verification process \u2013 immediate by bedside and high-definition video recording\n\nWeaknesses\n\nScans performed on 2 subjects\nUnclear methodology with regards to scan sequence and crossovers\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study highlights the usefulness of ultrasound in identification of the cricothyroid membrane in airway management. Like the use of ultrasound in vascular access, optimal and preferred probe orientation will be dependant on various individual factors.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0A randomised cross-over comparison of the transverse and longitudinal techniques for ultrasound-guided identification of the cricothyroid membrane in morbidly obese subjects\n[further reading]\u00a0Ultrasound in airway management\n[further reading]\u00a0Role of ultrasound in the airway management of critically ill patients.\n[further watching]\u00a0Ultrasound to assist cricothyroid identification\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Adrian Wong\nSummary date: 20 October 2016\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\n\n\n"
