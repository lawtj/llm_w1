Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health 2018; doi:10.1111/jpc.14309\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult subjects who ingest a small toy part, compared to historical controls of children who have ingested coins, is there a difference in object transit time and complication rate?\n\nBackground\n\nChildren in their developmental years will explore their environments, often by ingesting objects with no nutritional value\nThe most commonly ingested object (coins) has been shown to pass safely within 3-5 days with no ill effects (Spitz et al 1971)\nThere is a paucity of data regarding the second most commonly swallowed object \u2013 \u201ctoy parts\u201d\nThe lead author wanted to get a study into the Christmas BMJ\n\nDesign\n\nProspective, observational, non-blinded cohort study\nStandardised toy part of uniform dimensions (Lego Head) used\nForeign object ingested at the same time of day (0700-0900)\nBowel habit standardised between participants through the use of the Stool Hardness And Transit (SHAT score) \u2013 an average of Bristol Stool Chart scales over 3 days; with higher score indicating looser motions\nSHAT score compared pre ingestion \u00a0(pre SHAT) and post ingestion ( SHAT)\n\nSetting\n\n5 centres -3 in UK, 2 in Australia\nUnspecified 2 week period in 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Healthcare professionals working within paediatric hospital care\nExclusion:\n\nprevious\u00a0gastrointestinal surgery \ninability to ingest foreign objects\nAn aversion to searching through faecal matter\u00a0\n\n\n\n6 adult patients\n50% male\nMean age 36.2 (27-45)\n\nIntervention\n\nIngestion of standard Lego mini figure head\n\nControl\n\nHistorical controls from previous studies of ingested coins (Spitz, 1971)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: The Found and Retrieval Time (FART) score\n\n5/6 figures retrieved\nMean bowel motions to retrieval =2 (range 1-3)\nAverage FART score 1.71 days (1.14 to 3.04 days)\nOne participant searched 13 stools unsuccessfully over a 2 week period, with this figure yet to be located\n\n\nSecondary outcome: Comparison of SHAT and FART scores\n\nPre study SHAT score (n=6) range 3 o 5.67\nPost study SHAT score (n=5) range 2.96 to 7.76\nNo significant difference noted between pre and post study SHAT scores\nNo correlation noted between SHAT and FART scores\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nSmall objects, such as those followed by children, are likely to pass between 1 and 3 days without complication\n\nStrengths\n\nImportant research question\nStandardisation of toy object and stool scoring\nMale-female balance\nThe courage and determination of the authors must be lauded; many researchers lack the constitution to undergo such self-experimentation\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNon-randomised\nNon-blinded\nSmall numbers- the true complication rate cannot be estimated from this study\nAn adult population was studied, which is different from the population of interest (children)\nThe authors SHAT themselves- this would have covered them in difficult to remove bias\nSearch technique and searcher not standardised- exemplified by one item not being found\nUnvalidated scoring methods used in the study- the SHAT score is arguably crap and the FART score is arguably a load of hot air\nOne head was lost to follow up (follow through?) \u2013 the authors should have tried/pushed harder to locate it\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn this trial of 6 adults ingesting a standard Lego head, 5 of them were found within 3 days\nThis adds to years of data and human experience before that have already confirmed that swallowing small objects are safe for the vast majority of large and small humans\nI will not feel strained by human ingestion of small objects, and will feel under no pressure to furrow through faeces to find them\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Everything is Awesome: Don\u2019t forget the Lego\n[Blog Post] Don\u2019t forget the Bubbles: Everything is Awesome- Don\u2019t forget the Lego\n[further reading] Em Lit of Note: That Lego is gone\n[News interview] BBC: These doctors pooed out Lego to stop parents worrying\n[further reading]\u00a0The successful Christmas BMJ article.
