NEJM 2019; DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1806515\nClinical Question\n\nIn severely injured trauma patients, where anticoagulation is contraindicated, does the use of prophylactic inferior vena cava (IVC) filters reduce the incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE)?\n\nBackground\n\nVenous thromboembolism after trauma is common; in study of severely injured trauma patients, 18% had DVT and 11% had PE\n37% of all symptomatic PE occurred within the first 4 days after trauma\nConsidered a major cause of preventable death post\nMeta-analysis published in 2014 supported the use of IVC filters in trauma patients (lower incidence of PE and fatal PE)\nMeta-analysis published in 2017 (not restricted to trauma cohort) concluded that despite the limited quality of evidence, IVC filters appear to reduce the risk of subsequent PE, increase risk for DVT with no significant effect on mortality\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nPermuted-block scheme randomisation\nPatient and treating clinician aware of assignment\nTo minimise bias:\n\nProtocolised, proactive approach to detect symptomatic pulmonary embolus\nStrict criteria for performing CT pulmonary angiogram\n\n\nIntention to treat analysis\nAssuming 9% incidence rate of PE in severely injured trauma patients who did not receive prophylactic anticoagulation, 240 patients would provide 80% power to detect an 8.5% lower incidence of symptomatic PE with the IVC filter, allowing for 20% crossover between groups\nTrial protocol and statistical plan published\nNo financial or non-monetary (in-kind) support was received from any companies that manufacture IVC filters or from commercial entities\n\nSetting\n\n4 tertiary centres in Australia\nJune 2015 to December 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAge 18 years and above\nInjury Severity Score (ISS) > 15\nContraindication to prophylactic anticoagulation within 72 hours of presentation of injury\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nImminent death\nConfirmed pulmonary embolus\nSystemic anticoagulant treatment before injury\nPregnancy\nUnavailability of an interventional radiologist to insert the filter within 72 hours after admission\n\n\n1714 screened, 240 randomised (2 patients in each group crossed over)\nComparing baseline characteristics (Intervention vs control)\n\nAge (median): 35 vs 41\nMale (%): 77 vs 76.3\nBMI: 25.8 vs 27.2\nRace (%)\n\nWhite: 87.7 vs 89\nAsian 4.1 vs 3.4\n\n\nMedian time from injury to trial enrolment (hrs): 34.3 vs 32.5\nMedian ISS score: 27 vs 26\nMedian Trauma Embolic Scoring System score: 9 vs 9\nIntracranial haematoma or contusions (%): 60.7 vs 54.2\nActive bleeding on admission (%): 6.6 vs 10.2\nPrespecified subgroup \u2013 patients who did not receive anticoagulation within 7 days of injury (%): 38 vs 29\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nInsertion of IVC filter type left to the discretion of the interventional radiologist who performed procedure\n\n89% of filters inserted within 24 hours (median 15.6 hours)\n\n\nAll filters were removed as soon as prophylactic anticoagulation was safely established or before 90 days, unless there was a strong indication to leave the filter longer than this prespecified period\n\nControl\n\nNormal care as per management plan\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nInitiation of prophylactic anticoagulation as soon as clinically feasible but left at discretion of clinicians\nIntermittent pneumatic compression to uninjured legs\nClinicians were allowed to insert a filter for patients assigned to the control group if there was a well established indication\nRoutine Doppler and compression ultrasonography of the legs 2 weeks after enrolment\nAll deaths in the trial were referred to the coroner; if deemed necessary, a full postmortem examination was performed to determine whether pulmonary embolism was the cause of death\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nComposite score of confirmed symptomatic PE on CTPA or death from any cause at 90 days\n\nNo significant difference between intervention and control groups: 13.9% vs 14.4% (95% CI 0.51 to 1.94)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome (intervention vs control):\n\nSymptomatic pulmonary embolism in the subgroup of patients who survived at least 7 days and who did not receive prophylactic anticoagulation within 7 days after injury (38% in intervention group vs 29% in control)\n\n0 vs 14.7%\n\n\nComplications related to the IVC filters\n\nClots on filter at first removal attempt: 4.9%\nAdherent to IVC wall at first removal attempt: 1.6%\nMore than one attempt needed for removal: 5.7%\nSurgical removal required 0.9%\nFilter not removed due to technical reason or lost to follow up: 31.5%\n\n\nDeath at 90 days\n\n13.1% vs 9.3% (95% CI 0.69 \u2013 2.87)\n\n\nMajor bleeding at 90 days\n\n70.5% vs 66.1% (95% CI 0.9 \u2013 1.27)\n\n\nNon-major bleeding at 90 days\n\n23.8% vs 17.8% (95% CI 0.81 \u2013 2.2)\n\n\nDVT at 90 days, including deep-vein thrombosis detected by protocol-mandated ultrasonography of the legs at 2 weeks (not prespecified in the protocol)\n\n11.4% vs 10.1% (95% CI -11.4 \u2013 13.9)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe use of early, prophylactic placement of a IVC filter after major trauma did not result in a lower incidence of symptomatic pulmonary embolism or death at 90 days\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nMulti-centre\n\nWeaknesses\n\nA single site accounted for 96% of recruitment\nUnblinded which may have influenced behaviour of treating clinicians\n\nCompliance/adherence to CTPA protocol not available\nTiming to initiate anticoagulation\n\n\nPower calculation: Underpowered\n\n9% incidence rate of PE based on old very old data and hence may not be reflective of modern practice\n8.5% absolute risk reduction translates to a 94% relative risk reduction\n\n\nComposite end point;
