With the groups also being unblinded, this introduces bias, challenging its internal validity.\nExternal validation further challenged by skewed patient population:\n\n216/231 (93.5%) were surgical of which 108 (46.75%) were cardiac surgery patients\n203 (88%) were mechanically ventilated at time of randomization\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis single centre study demonstrates a significant reduction in 90 day mortality with early (stage 2 KDIGO) initiation of RRT, in a group of almost entirely surgical patients. If I worked in this unit or a similar highly surgical ICU, I would consider changing my practice.\nHowever, other studies challenge these conclusions. A larger multi-centre trial including a more mixed ICU patient population is needed in order to validate these data on a larger scale.\n\nExternal Links\n[article]\u00a0Effect of Early vs Delayed Initiation of Renal Replacement Therapy on Mortality in Critically Ill Patients With Acute Kidney Injury\n[Editorial] Early to Dialyze: Healthy and Wise?\n[further reading] Initiation Strategies for Renal Replacement Therapy in the Intensive Care Unit\n[further reading] Nephrology journal club: Acute Kidney Injury, when to dialyse.\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Segun Olusanya\nSummary date:\u00a015 June 2016\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
