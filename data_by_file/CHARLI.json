Dixon. Lancet Respiratory Medicine; 2021 Jan 22;S2213-2600(20)30470-7. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30470-7\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with or at risk of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), can nebulised heparin compared to placebo, accelerate recovery of physical function?\n\nBackground\n\nARDS affects 23% of mechanically ventilated patients and has a mortality of up to 46%\nA large proportion of survivors of ARDS have significant limitations in physical function, which can persist for several years\nMost studied pharmaceutical agents (including statins, aspirin, ketoconazole and vitamin D amongst others) have yielded disappointing results in phase 3 trials, despite often showing promise in early phase trials\nA key part of the inflammatory response in ARDS is fibrin accumulation in pulmonary capillaries and venules, which can lead to microvascular thrombosis, the extent of which correlates with the severity of acute lung injury. This could theoretically be mitigated by heparin and is supported by improvements in pulmonary dead space, coagulation activation and microvascular thrombosis in phase 1 and 2 studies\nHeparin may confer other benefits that make it an appealing therapeutic option in patients with or at risk of ARDS such as binding of bacterial and viral pathogens, inhibition of inflammatory pathways, reduced mucus tenacity, and prevention of bronchospasm\n\nDesign\n\nMulticentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial\nRandomisation in a 1:1 ratio to nebulised heparin (intervention group) or placebo (control group), using variable block sizes and stratification by site\nTo detect a clinically important 10-point improvement in the primary outcome (SF-36 Health Survey Physical Function Score) from 45 to 55 with SD 25, 80% power, and a two-sided significance level of 0\u00b705, a sample of 198 patients was required. To account for the anticipated loss of data due to death assuming a mortality rate of 30% up to day 60, a further 58 patients were required, giving a final target sample size of 256\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nPlanned interim analyses by the DSMB after the 50th, 100th and 200th enrolments.\nRegistered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register\n\nSetting\n\n256 patients were recruited (n=131 to the intervention group; n=125 to the control group) in nine hospitals in Australia between September 4, 2012 and August 23, 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Mechanically ventilated adult patients (age 18 or older) who met all of the following criteria:\n\nMechanical ventilation commenced on the day before or day of recruitment\nExpected to require invasive ventilation until the end of the next day\nP:F ratio <300 or SpO2:FiO2 ratio <315 at any time since commencing invasive ventilation\nActive ventilator circuit humidification\n\n\nExclusion: The main exclusion criteria were as follows:\n\nAllergy to heparin\nHistory of heparin induced thrombocytopaenia\nPlatelet count <50 or APTT >80 seconds\nUncontrolled bleeding or pulmonary bleeding during current hospital admission\nHistory of intracranial, spinal or epidural hemorrhage\nHepatic encephalopathy, history of gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal hypertension or cirrhosis with portal hypertension\nPre-existing tracheostomy, oxygen or assisted ventilation at home\nNeurological diagnosis impacting on respiratory function (such as cervical spinal cord injury, MND, GBS)\nTreatment limitations (including RRT, vasoactive medications), dementia or death considered imminent\nPregnancy\n\n\n256 patients were randomised, 131 to nebulised heparin and 125 to placebo\nData were analysed for 128 participants assigned to heparin and 124 to placebo after three participants withdrew consent and another was ineligible due to thrombocytopenia\nVolume of scheduled dose delivered was 94.7% in the intervention group and 98.1% in the control group\nSimilar concomitant low molecular weight heparin use (any; 73% vs 70%) and therapeutic dose unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin use (25% vs 18%) between groups\nBaseline demographics (intervention group vs placebo group)\n\nMedian age: 58 vs 59 years\nMale sex: 65% vs 60%\nMajor comorbidities:\n\nCOPD: 25% vs 26%\nAsthma: 16% vs 16%\nOther respiratory disease: 11% vs 14%\n\n\nRisk factors for ARDS:\n\nPneumonia: 68% vs 73%\nSepsis, non-pulmonary: 16% vs 15%\nInhalation of food/gastric contents: 13% vs 16%\n\n\nAPACHE II score: 23 vs 24\nTherapies:\n\nInotropes/vasopressors: 81% vs 75%\nRenal replacement therapy: 12% vs 10%\nCorticosteroid: 48% vs 49%\n\n\nRespiratory rescue therapies:\n\nNeuromuscular blocker: 46% vs 49%\nRecruitment manoeuver: 7% vs 8%\nNitric oxide or prostaglandin: 6% vs 8%\nProne positioning: 1% vs 2%\n\n\nRespiratory characteristics:\n\nP:F ratio (unit): 185 vs 184\nTidal volume (ml/kg pbw): 7.6 vs 7.8\nPEEP (cmH2O): 10.2 vs 10\nPpeak (cmH2O): 25.1 vs 24.5\n\n\nAcute lung injury assessments:\n\nARDS\n\nAt risk: 49% vs 57%\nPresent: 51% vs 43%\n\n\nARDS severity\n\nMild: 15% vs 13%\nModerate: 31% vs 24%\nSevere: 5% vs 6%\n\n\nMurray lung injury score:\n\nIf at risk of ARDS: 1.91 vs 1.95\nIf ARDS present: 2.63 vs 2.50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nUnfractionated heparin sodium \n\n25\u2008000 IU in 5 mL, administered using a vibrating mesh membrane nebuliser every 6 hours to day 10 while invasively ventilated\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\n(sodium chloride 0\u00b79% 5 mL), administered identically\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nStandard of care, including the administration of intravenous and subcutaneous heparin\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: SF-36 Physical Function Score (patient or proxy reported limitations across ten physical activities) of survivors at day 60 \u2013 no significant difference\n\nIntervention group vs control group: (95% CI): 53.6 vs 48.7, MD 4.9 (-4.8 to 14.5) \u2013 a lower score indicates worse limitation\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: Fewer patients in the intervention group developed ARDS and deterioration in Murray Lung Injury Score at day 5. At day 60 there were more survivors residing at home in the intervention group\n\nAt day 5 \u2013 intervention group vs control group (95% CI):\n\nDeveloped new ARDS: 15% vs 30%, HR 0.46 (0.22 to 0.98), p=0.04\nDeterioration in Murray Lung Injury Score: -0.05 vs 0.09, MD -0.14 (-0.26 to -0.02), p=0.02\n\n\nAt day 28:\n\nNew respiratory therapies:\n\nNeuromuscular blocker: 24% vs 29%, OR 0.78 (0.36 to 1.72)\nRecruitment manoeuver: 12% vs 9%, OR 1.44 (0.61 to 3.39)\nNitric oxide or nebulised prostacyclin: 6% vs 9%, OR 0.66 (0.24 vs 1.80)\nProne positioning: 2% vs 2%, OR 0.96 (0.19 to 4.85)\n\n\nTime to ventilator separation: 9.9 days vs 10.2 days, HR 1.01 (0.77 to 1.33)\nTime to ICU separation: 11.9 days vs 12.6 days, HR 1.08 (0.82 to 1.42)\nICU readmission: 1% vs 9%, OR 0.10 (0.01 to 0.81), p=0.03\nDeceased: 17% vs 13%, OR 1.39 (0.69 to 2.79)\n\n\nAt day 60:\n\nSurvivors residing at home: 87% vs 73%, OR 2.45 (1.18 to 5.08), p=0.02\nDeceased: 18% vs 15%, OR 1.29 (0.66 to 2.53)\n\n\n\n\nAdverse events: Serious adverse events were similar in each group; 5% in the intervention group vs 2% in the control group, OR 2\u00b733 (0\u00b759\u20139\u00b724), although APTT peak for patients who received concomitant systemic prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation was 69s in the intervention group and 51s in the control group; MD 18 (6-30), p=0.0037.

Good adherence to protocol in both groups\nAnother study demonstrating that nebulised heparin was easy to administer and well tolerated alongside concomitant systemic low molecular weight and unfractionated heparin \n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe statistical analysis plan was not published apriori\nHeterogeneous population with a range of lung injury severity\nExternal validity threatened by enrolment of nearly 50% of patients from 1 centre and exclusion of nearly 90% of patients screened\nThe primary outcome of choice may have been problematic as only survivors could be assessed. Additionally a physical performance score at day 60 may not be the best way to assess the efficacy of such a targeted single organ intervention and may be susceptible to confounding\nNebulised heparin moderately increased the peak APTT in patients receiving concomitant systemic anticoagulation. It is plausible that this could have led to inadvertent unmasking of some patients assigned to the intervention\nExcluding deceased patients there was close to 10% loss to follow-up. The direction of any bias associated with this is not possible to infer, although it is plausible that this could be a consequence of poor functional status that was not captured by the primary outcome measure\nAlthough some secondary outcomes suggested benefit of the intervention, without correction for multiple comparisons these are susceptible to type 1 error and should be considered hypothesis generating only\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study did not show an improvement in the physical function of survivors of critical illness with or at risk of ARDS at day 60\nGiven the improvement in certain physiological parameters in previous studies and secondary outcomes supporting the attenuation of lung injury in this study, it is possible that the wrong outcome measure or population was studied\nFurther studies should focus on more clinically important outcomes such as mortality or duration of mechanical ventilation, ideally in a more homogenous population\nAside from corticosteroids there is still no proven efficacious pharmaceutical prevention or treatment for ARDS, and there is currently insufficient evidence to begin using nebulised heparin in this setting\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Nebulised heparin for patients with or at risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome: a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Andrew Achilleos\nSummary date: 18/02/2021\nPeer-review editor: david slessor\nPicture by: Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
