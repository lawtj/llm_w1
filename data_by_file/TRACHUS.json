Assuming absolute non-inferiority margin of 6% at one-sided alpha significance of 0.05\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre study\n8 ICUs in Sao Paulo University\nMarch 2014 \u2013 May 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adult patients, intubated, mechanically ventilated and indicated for a tracheostomy\nExclusion: Unsuitable anatomy; short neck; tracheal deviation; cervical anomaly; previous cervical surgery; cervical trauma; cervical tumours; unable extend neck; inability to get written consent\n4965 assessed for eligibility. 171 patients eligible, 118 randomised\nWell matched except SAPS score at ICU admission\n\nIntervention\n\nUltrasound-guided PCT\n\nMidline identified by transverse scan\nLongitudinal plane 2nd/3rd ring\nReal time puncture in transverse plane at midline\n\n\n\nControl\n\nBronchoscopy guided PCT\n\nAirway cartilages identified\n2nd/3rd space identified and punctured\nDirect observation\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: No significant difference in composite outcome (conversion to surgical tracheostomy, switching groups or major complication) between US-guided PCT and bronchoscopy-guided PCT\n\nmajor complications: death, cardiac arrest, tracheal wall injury, false passage, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, oesophageal injury, TOF, persistent hypotension, persistent acute hypoxaemia, major bleeding, tracheostomy sepsis\none failure in each group (1.7%)\n\nUS group \u2013 insertion between 5th and 6th tracheal ring leading to tracheal laceration and mediastinitis\nBronchoscopy group \u2013 insertion causing tracheal laceration and pneumomediastinum\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome: No statistically significant difference in minor complications\n20 (33%) US group vs 12 (20.7%) bronchoscopy group; p=0.122\n\nminor complications: procedural length, procedural difficulty, alive ventilator free days at 60 days, ICU mortality, Minor complications (transient hypotension, transient acute hypoxia, cuff puncture, decannulation, stoma infection, localised minor bleeding, localised emphysema)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nUS-guided PCT is non-inferior to bronchoscopy-guided PCT in mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU\n\nStrengths\n\nProspective randomisation\nAllocation concealment\nLimited exclusion criterion\nHigh percentage of enrolments of eligible patients\nThe clinical outcomes were clinically relevant and the data analysis was blinded\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle-center investigation\nComposite primary end point and small sample number to detect complications\nNon-inferiority margin of 6 % might be considerably high for the low primary outcome incidence rate\nFollowed only until hospital discharge and were not assessed for late complications such as tracheal stenosis, vocal abnormalities, or scar characteristics\nBlinding was not possible\nLarger study to detect minor complications may have shown significance\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nUS-guided was not inferior to bronchoscopy-guided PCT. Although the study was underpowered to detect differences for minor complications (50% more in the US group)\nUltrasound has been shown to be useful to aid placement of a percutaneous tracheostomy. I will now use ultrasound to aid landmark identification of the correct tracheal space\nHowever, this study has not completely changed my practice. I will continue to use ultrasound and bronchoscopy for my percutaneous tracheostomies because of their distinct safety features. Ultrasound can detect vessels and thyroid beneath the puncture site and potentially avoid significant haemorrhage. Bronchoscopy can detect oesophageal perforations with the needle prior to dilatation. Why choose between bronchoscopy and ultrasound when we can use both?\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Ultrasound-guided percutaneous dilational tracheostomy versus bronchoscopy-guided percutaneous dilational tracheostomy in critically ill patients (TRACHUS): a randomized noninferiority controlled trial\n[further reading]\u00a0Trachestomy procedures in the Intensive Care Unit: an international survey\n[Instructional video]\u00a0Percutaneous tracheostomy video: how to do it\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Phil McGlone\nSummary date: March 7th 2016\nPeer-review editor: Celia Bradford\n\n\n"
