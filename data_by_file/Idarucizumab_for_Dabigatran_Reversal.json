BCSH guidelines\u00a0recommend the use of\u00a0prothrombin complex concentrates and other treatments for dabigatran reversal\nCauses for mortality not clear for some patients. i.e. some patient had cardiac arrest, was this due to a thrombosis, bleeding or anaphylaxis secondary to\u00a0Idarucizumab? \u00a0(Idarucizumab is an antibody fragment. Other antibody fragments e.g. digibind can cause anaphylaxis.) One patient had a haemodynamic collapse whereas another patient had a circulatory collapse. What is the difference between these two, and what caused both of these \u2018collapses\u2019?\nSmall number of patients\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis prospective cohort study demonstrated that clotting tests normalised immediately following 2.5g of idarucizumab. Thrombotic events were recorded in 6% of patients following treatment with\u00a0idarucizumab. Further studies are required, in particular to assess the safety of\u00a0idarucizumab. These studies should ideally not have as much pharmaceutical company involvement as the current trial. However while waiting for these studies, if I have a patient who has a life threatening bleed following a recent dose of dabigatran, I would want to use\u00a0idarucizumab to reverse\u00a0the coagulation effects of dabigatran\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0Idarucizumab for Dabigatran Reversal\n[Further reading]\u00a0BCSH Guideline on the management of bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents\n[Further reading]\u00a0Performance of Various Laboratory Assays in the Measurement of Dabigatran in Patients Receiving Therapeutic Doses\n[Further reading]\u00a0Therapeutic antibodies: successes, limitations and hopes for the future\n[Further reading] REBEL EM: Dancing with the Devil: Taking Dabigatran to the OR\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date: 27th August 2015\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@DuncanChambler\n\n\n\n"
