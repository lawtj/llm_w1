Critical Care 2014; 18:R70. doi:10.1186/cc13827\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and severe sepsis or septic shock, does extended daily haemofiltration (EDHF) compared with continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVHF) reduce time to renal recovery or mortality at 60 days?\n\nDesign\n\nRetrospective, observational cohort study\nAllocation to EDHF or CVVHF at clinician\u2019s discretion\nProspective data recording but retrospective analysis\nNo blinding of analysts\nStatistical control for patho-physiological variables\n\nSetting\n\nOne teaching hospital in China\nJuly 2009 to May 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: patients with septic shock or severe sepsis according to standard international criteria and AKI according to RIFLE criteria\nExclusion: non-sepsis AKI, failure to meet CVVHF or EDHF criteria as determined by consultant nephrologist, death or cessation of RRT within 72 hours\n583 patients admitted for RRT of which 145 met the above criteria:\n\n65 included in CVVHF analysis\n80 included in EDHF analysis\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nEDHF\n\nHaemofiltration for 8\u201312 hours daily\n\n\n\nControl\n\nCVVHF\n\nHaemofiltration continuously with replacement of the filter every 24 hours routinely\n39% changed to EDHF or intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) after 72 hours due to a change in clinical state (increased stability)\n\n\n\nComparison of groups, as EDHF vs CVVHF:\n\n\nPatient characteristics:\n\nMean age \u2013 69 years vs 68 years\nMean APACHE II score \u2013 31 vs 31\nSevere sepsis : septic shock ratio \u2013 81:19 vs 68:32 (p=0.06)\nMean arterial pressure \u2013 74 mmHg vs 65 mmHg (p=0.037)\nRIFLE criteria as % risk:injury:failure \u2013 16:39:45 vs 18:38:43 (p=0.936)\n\n\nRRT characteristics:\n\nMean blood flow \u2013 231 ml/min vs 213 ml/min\nMean ultrafiltrate \u2013 242 ml/h vs 149 ml/h\nMean replacement per hour \u2013 40 ml/kg/h vs 29 ml/kg/h\n\n\n\nBoth groups were:\n\n\nBuffered with bicarbonate replacement fluid in 100% pre-dilutional mode\nanticoagulated with unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, citrate or argatroban within the extracorporeal circuit\nstopped when urine output was greater than 1000 ml/day and renal biochemistry was improving or normal\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nRenal recovery at 60 days: EDHF 32.50% vs CVVHF 50.77% (p=0.026)\nAll-cause mortality at 60 days: EDHF 46.25% vs CVVHF 44.62% (p=0.844)\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nMedian time to renal recovery: EDHF 25.46 days vs CVVHF 17.26 days (p=0.039)\nOccurrence of adverse events:\n\nBleeding: EDHF 13% vs CVVHF 22% (p=0.145)\nHypotension: 26% vs 15% (p=0.112)\nHypokalaemia: 39% vs 51% (p=0.147)\nHypophosphataemia: 29% vs 55% (p=0.001)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nCVVHF was associated with better rates of renal recovery and earlier recovery, but did not change mortality rates at 60 days. \u201c[CVVHF] is beneficial for haemodynamically unstable patients in the acute stages of septic AKI\u201d\n\nStrengths\n\nData collected prospectively\nUnivariate and multivariate analysis conducted to confirm raw findings\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRetrospective observational study: suggests\u00a0association\u00a0not\u00a0causation\nSingle centre and small numbers for observational study\nArbitrary decision to perform EDHF or CVVHF depending on clinician\u2019s opinion\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study does not identify any significant reasons to consider EDHF as more beneficial than the conventional CVVHF.\nA large randomised, controlled trial will be needed to explore this further if the clinical question remains relevant (roughly 120\u00a0patients\u00a0per group\u00a0will be needed \u2013\u00a0at 80% power and alpha level of 0.05 based upon the\u00a0observed primary outcome values in this study)\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0Continuous venovenous hemofiltration versus extended daily hemofiltration in patients with septic acute kidney injury: a retrospective cohort study\n[further reading]\u00a0Dialysis: renal replacement therapy in the ICU by Yartsev\n[further reading]\u00a0Renal replacement therapy terminology and nomenclature by Life in the Fast Lane\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 28 November 2014\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@DavidSlessor\n\n\n"
