Given our understanding of the pathogenicity of severe COVID-19 disease it has been proposed as a therapeutic treatment in selected patients\nSeveral RCTs investigating tocilizumab have not demonstrated efficacy (BACC, COVACTA ,CORIMUNO-TOCI-1, RCT-TCZ-COVID-19, EMPACTA). However, many of the patients in these studies were not critically ill, there was variable use of steroids and several prespecified secondary outcomes such as ICU and hospital length of stay suggested possible efficacy in the COVACTA study\nMost recently the REMAP-CAP IL-6 antagonist arm published a pre-print reporting >99.9% and 99.5% posterior probabilities of superiority for tocilizumab and sarilumab respectively compared to placebo for its primary endpoint of median number of organ support free days, although this is yet to be peer reviewed\n\nDesign\n\nOpen label, multi-centre, randomised, parallel group clinical trial\nRandomisation in a 1:1 ratio with random block sizes stratified by age and gender according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule\nAllocation concealment maintained through use of central automated web accessed system\nDesigned to enrol 150 patients to provide 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 0.44 of having a higher seven level ordinal scale at 15 days at the 0.05 (two-sided) level of significance\nData collected until day 29 by unblinded hospital researchers. For patients who were discharged prior to day 15, a telephone interview by a blinded researcher\nPrimary outcome \u2013 clinical status at 15 days\n\nBased on 7 level ordinal scale\n\n\u00a0Not admitted to hospital and with no limitation in activities\nAdmitted to hospital but with limitation in activities\nAdmitted to hospital and not receiving supplemental oxygen\nAdmitted to hospital and receiving supplemental oxygen\nAdmitted to hospital and receiving non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or high flow nasal oxygen\nAdmitted to hospital and receiving mechanical ventilation\nDeath\n\n\nPrimary outcome planned to be assessed with ordinal logistic regression assuming proportional odds ratios adjusted for stratification variables\nHowever the assumption of odds proportionality was not met and therefore changed to a binary outcome\n\nLevels 1-5 vs. 6-7 (alive and not receiving mechanical ventilation vs. receiving mechanical ventilation and death)\n\n\n\n\nIntention-to-treat primary analysis with per protocol sensitivity analysis\nOne planned interim analysis when 50% of planned patients were recruited (n=75), performed by an independent DMC with pre-defined criteria for study interruption\n\nThe study was interrupted by the DMC at interim analysis owing to an excess number of deaths at 15 days in the tocilizumab group\nRapid recruitment meant that when complete data for 15 day follow-up was available for the first 75 patients, 129 patients had been enrolled\n\n\nRegistered at clinicaltrials.gov (after enrolment of patients had started due to administrative error)\n\nSetting\n\nNine hospitals in Brazil\nData collected between May 8th and July 17th, 2020\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nFinal inclusion criteria were as follows:\n\nAdult in-patients aged 18 years or older\nRT-PCR positive for SARS-coV-2\nSymptoms for > three days\nPresence of pulmonary infiltrates confirmed by chest CT or x-ray\nNeed for oxygen supplementation to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO2) > 93% OR need for mechanical ventilation for < 24 hours before the randomisation\nIn addition two or more of the following inflammatory tests:\n\nD dimer >2.74 nmol/L (>1000 ng/mL)\nCRP >50 mg/L (>5 mg/dL)\nFerritin >300 \u03bcg/L\nLDH greater than the upper limit of normal\n\n\n\n\nTwo changes were made to the trial protocol from its inception to the point of data analysis\n\nThe need for mechanical ventilation was originally an exclusion criterion but the protocol was amended to allow inclusion of patients mechanically ventilated for less than 24 hours on June 4th, 2020\nThe original protocol required CT evidence of COVID-19 as the sole radiographic inclusion criterion, but this was expanded to include chest X-ray evidence on July 7, 2020\n\n\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nActive uncontrolled infection\nHypersensitivity to tocilizumab\nPatients expected to die or receiving palliative care\nNeutrophil count < 0.5 x 109/L or

follow up at the interim analysis. Of these, 18% died before day 15 in the intervention arm compared with 4.5% in the standard care arm (p=0.042).\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\u201cIn this trial including patients admitted to hospital with severe or critical COVID-19, the use of tocilizumab plus standard care was not superior to standard care alone in improving patients\u2019 clinical status at 15 days, and might have increased mortality.\u201d\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre, randomised, controlled trial\nAn important clinical question in the context of the pandemic and a useful addition to a growing evidence base for IL-6 antagonists\nRandom block sizes according to a computer generated schedule ensured allocation concealment\nThe majority of patients were receiving corticosteroids in both arms, which is now the standard of care and a potential limitation of previous studies such as BACC and COVACTA where relatively few patients received this therapy. Use of antibiotics and antivirals was also similar between groups\nInternal validity is strong owing to specific inclusion criteria that reflects the hypothesis that patients most likely to benefit from IL-6 antagonists are those with evidence of severe disease and a persistent inflammatory state.\nBaseline demographics of the intervention and control groups were generally well matched\nThere was good adherence to protocol and only two protocol violations in the standard care arm\nAll patients were included in analysis\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOpen label design is susceptible to clinician bias at the bedside and reporting of outcomes\nThe number of patients assessed for eligibility was not recorded, so selection bias cannot be excluded\nThe sample size was relatively small and over 50% of patients were recruited from 1 centre, which may reduce external validity\nThe protocol was amended twice once recruitment was underway, although the nature of these changes were unlikely to have created a source of bias\nThere were differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups, with more patients receiving NIV or high flow nasal oxygen in the control group. Currently we do not know if the use of NIV or high flow nasal oxygen is beneficial or harmful\nThe baseline FiO2 or P/F ratio is not stated which makes it more difficult to compare the baseline severity of illness between the two groups\nThe study was terminated at the first interim analysis before recruiting the intended number of patients, underpowering the study to detect any treatment effect\nThe primary outcome was changed to a binary endpoint during the study as the distribution of the seven level ordinal scale did not fit proportional odds assumptions. Although the potential for this change was anticipated and specified apriori, this had the effect of reducing further the statistical power\nTwo patients in the control arm received tocilizumab, which could potentially bias results towards the null, as generally sicker patients crossover into intervention groups. However this number is relatively small and the clinical endpoints were robust to the per protocol sensitivity analysis\nThe signal towards increased mortality with tocilizumab is an outlier compared with other studies, which raises the possibility that in spite of it\u2019s controlled nature there may have been confounders that were unaccounted for\nThe mortality in the control group was low at 9% (compared with 36% in REMAP-CAP). With a small sample size, this may be a chance finding\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study was terminated at the first interim analysis owing to an excess number of deaths in the tocilizumab group\nThis is the first RCT to demonstrate a signal to harm of tocilizumab therapy in patients with COVID-19, which in the absence of REMAP-CAP peer review and several negative studies is reason for caution\nThe RECOVERY trial continues to recruit patients to receive tocilizumab as part of its adaptive platform design and I will continue to preferentially recruit patients into this trial\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Effect of tocilizumab on clinical outcomes at 15 days in patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019: randomised controlled trial\n[Understanding the Proportional Odds Assumption in Clinical Trials]\n\nMetadata\nReviewed by: Andrew Achilleos 24/01/2021\nPeer-review editor: Dave Slessor\nImage by Syaibatul Hamdi from Pixabay\n\n\n"
