Intensive Care Medicine 2021. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-021-06526-8\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically unwell adults does targeting individualised glycaemic control compared to glycaemia < 180 mg/dL improve 90 day mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nHyperglycaemia has been shown to result in worse outcomes in the critically ill, especially in non-diabetic patients\nIn 2009, NICE-SUGAR showed that intensive glucose control was harmful with\u00a0 higher rates of hypoglycaemia and mortality in the intensive control group\nSome observational studies have shown that relationship between glycaemia in ICU and adverse events (hypoglycaemia and mortality) may depend on the patient\u2019s pre-admission glycaemic control\nHbA1c or glycated haemoglobin reflects the mean plasma glucose over the life of a red blood cell (~3 months), and values at ICU admission and prior to ICU admission correlate well\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre\nDouble blind randomised parallel group trial\nConducted in mixed, medical and surgical ICUs\nConsent from patients or family obtained\nIf eligible then a blood sample drawn to ascertain HbA1c\n\nIf deemed eligible then needed to rule out presence of exclusion criteria within 96 hours of ICU admission\n\n\nGlycaemic control was conducted in accordance with an online algorithm designed by two of the authors\n\nInsulin was commenced prior to randomisation if > 180 mg/dL for all patients\n\n\nRandomisation was 1:1 and stratified by centre\n\nHowever, if numbers in each arm differed by >4% then next patient automatically included into group with lower numbers\n\n\nIntervention maintained until patient discharged from ICU\nAll clinicians blinded to HbA1c result, and glycaemic and infusion history\n\nFor safety, the nurse in charge could access the last glycaemic value entered and insulin infusion rate and any history of hypoglycaemic episodes\n\n\nPower calculation:\n\n2100 patients per group needed\n90% power to detect a 4% difference from a baseline mortality of 22% with a two-sided significance level of 5%\nBased on NICE-SUGAR\n\n\nModified intention to treat basis\nTrial stopped early after 49% of planned sample size recruited\n\nRecommended by DSMB due to low likelihood of benefit and possibility of harm\n\n\nConversion from mg/dL to mmol/L\n\n217 = 12.1\n180 = 10\n111 = 6.2\n72 = 4.0\n40 = 2.2\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n12 ICUs in France\nMay 2015 \u2013 July 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n> 18 yo\nAdmitted to ICU with the expectation not to be discharged within 2 days\nUnable to feed orally\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nPregnancy\nPrior enrolment\nLimitations of therapy\nDiabetics with a known history of transfusion > 3 red blood cell units in the last 3 months (may falsely lower HbA1c)\n\n\n5326 patients admitted \u2192 2075 randomised of which 158 did not receive intervention \u2192 942 in intervention arm and 975 in conventional arm\n\nReasons for not being included:\n\n690 expected to stay in ICU for < 48 hours\n1300 did not have exclusion criteria assessed\n423 met exclusion criteria\n827 did not have HbA1c level within 96 hrs\n\n\n\n\nComparing baseline

both\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nIndividualised glycaemic control\n\nGlycaemic target calculated using HbA1c +15 mg/dL\nLimits set at minimum of 111mg/dL and a maximum 217 mg/dL for safety reasons\nThe median HbA1c of 5.8% results in a calculated target of 120 mg/dL (+ 15 mg/dL)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard glycaemic control\n\nGlycaemic target < 180mg/dL\nInsulin infusion initiated when greater than this\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAlgorithm gave nurse instructions for insulin administration, sampling for glycaemia and correction for hypoglycaemia.\nSampling time between 1 \u2013 6 hours depending on levels and previous stability\nFollowing randomisation insulin commenced if above set target, it was reduced if 29mg/dL less than target\nIf levels reached 63 mg/dL then insulin stopped and 30% dextrose administered\nAll other care at the discretion of treating teams\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: 90-day survival (intervention v control)\n\n67.2% [95% CI 64.2 \u2013 70.3] v 69.6% [95% CI 66.7 \u2013 72.5], p = 0.23\nNo difference when adjusted for multiple parameters including age, diabetic status, BMI and receipt of invasive ventilation\nPost hoc subgroup analysis:\n\nSignificantly higher risk of 90 day mortality in intervention group for non-diabetics, surgical group and those with an HbA1c between 5 \u2013 6%\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nNo significant difference in 28d mortality, ICU length of stay, duration of vasoactive support, RRT requirement, mechanical ventilation and non-prophylactic anti-microbial use\n\n\nAdverse Events:\n\nSevere hypoglycaemia (<40mg/dL)\n\n3.9% v 2.5% (p = 0.09)\n\n\nAny hypoglycaemia (<72 mg/dL)\n\n31.2% v 15.8% (p < 0.0001)\n\n\nThis was significantly higher in non diabetic patients, but not for diabetic patients\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nTargeting a patient\u2019s usual glycaemic level did not show a survival benefit compared to conventional control and targeting a glycaemic level of 180 mg/dL\n\nStrengths\n\nDouble blinded trial in an area of critical care with few randomised trials despite the frequency with which parameters for blood glucose control are set for ICU patients\nBalanced baseline characteristics between groups\nMinimal protocol violations (<1%)\nBlinding methods minimise performance and detection bias\nMinimal loss to follow up (n=9)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nTrial ended early prior to enrolment of calculated sample size\nTime lag bias as data collected in 2016 but not published until 2021\nLarge numbers not assessed for exclusion criteria may result in selection bias\nThe allowance of 96 hours following ICU admission for enrolment is a long time in the critically unwell\n\nThe intervention group received the same target as the conventional group until randomisation (<180mg/dL) results in contamination bias\nPatients in the intervention group spent 26% of their ICU stay without an individualised target (and exposed to a target of 180 mg/dL)\n\n\nThe authors postulate that insulin resistance may change over critical illness\n\nIf this is true, does the use a value that reflects glycaemic control over the three months prior to critical illness provide the best method for targeting personalised glycaemic control whilst critically unwell?\n\n\nThe algorithm used was not validated prior to it\u2019s use\nThe mean difference in time-weighted blood glucose was only 13 mg/dL between groups (0.7mmol/L) (eTable 3). It is unlikely this is clinically relevant\n\nHowever if stratified by HbA1c there was statistical separation in time-weighted blood glucose for all HbA1c levels except between 7 and 8% (which was expected as an HbA1c of 7.4% = a target of 180mg/dL)\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nUntil better evidence becomes available surrounding personalised glycaemic targets in ICU, I will continue to adopt a conventional target for all patients\n\nExternal Links\n\n[editorial] The goal of personalized glucose control in the critically ill remains elusive\n[article] CONTROLING Study\n[IBCC] Stress Hyperglycaemia in the ICU\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker @hgmwalker89\nSummary date: 7th December 2021\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\nPicture by: Pixabay\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
