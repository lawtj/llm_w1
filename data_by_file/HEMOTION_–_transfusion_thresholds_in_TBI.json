NEJM June 13 2024; doi:10.1056/NEJMoa240360\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury, does a liberal transfusion strategy (transfusion if haemoglobin <10g/dl) compared to a restrictive strategy (transfusion if haemoglobin <7g/dl) reduce the rate of an unfavourable Glasgow Outcome Scale \u2013 Extended, at 6 months.\n\nBackground\n\nTraumatic Brain Injury accounts for the most number of trauma related deaths and has a high rate of morbidity in survivors\nThe optimal haemoglobin target in patients following traumatic brain injury is unknown. A Cochrane Review of the available evidence states that the optimal target is unclear\nA trial in all ICU patients, the TRICC trial, suggested a restrictive transfusion practice was superior to a liberal strategy, however, this trial was published 15 years ago and was in the era where transfused blood was not leukodepleted. There were only small numbers of TBI patients included in the cohort\nThe injured brain is vulnerable to hypoxia and anaemia may exacerbate this state worsening the secondary injury\n\nDesign\n\nPatients were randomised 1:1 to a liberal or restrictive strategy\nAllocation concealment and variable permuted blocks, stratified to centre\nThe treating clinicians were unblinded, but the follow-up assessors were blinded\nThe transfusion target was maintained until discharge from ICU\nAn independent data and safety monitoring committee reviewed data after each 25% increment of the target enrollment was reached. It also evaluated the results of a protocol-specified formal interim analysis that was performed when enrollment was at 50% of the target\nConsent was obtained from next of kin or deferred when appropriate\nIntention to treat analysis was performed\n\nSetting\n\n34 centres in Canada, the UK, France, and Brazil were included\nPatients were randomised between September 2017 and April 2023\nA sample size of 712 patients provided 80% power to detect an absolute difference between groups of 10% for the primary outcome\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: adult patients with moderate or severe TBI (GCS 3-12) with anaemia (Hb<10g/dL)\nExclusion:\n\nPatients who had received transfusion before randomisation.\nContraindication to transfusion or active bleeding\nPatients who were brain dead or GCS 3 with fixed pupils\n\n\n6188 patients were assessed for eligibility with 742 randomised. 2 of these were randomised in error (had SAH) and 4 withdrew consent. This left 736 patients in the intention to treat analysis\nBaseline characteristics\n\n72.7% of patients were men, the mean age was 48.7\u00b118.9 years (+/-SD), and 73.2% had a severe traumatic brain injury (GCS <8)\nThe mean injury severity score was 30\nPatients were assessed for chance of poor outcome using prognostic variables of the TBI-IMPACT calculator\nThere were some imbalances between groups\n\nIn the restrictive-strategy group there were more:\n\nwomen (30% vs 24%)\npatients with a GCS motor score of 1 (32.7% vs 26%)\npatients with no pupillary reactivity (14.1% vs 12.4%)\npatients who had an episode of hypotension (28.8% vs 22.7%)\n\n\nIn the liberal-strategy group there were more\n\nepisodes of low cerebral perfusion pressure (22.1% vs 17.3%)\npatients with a Marshall score of V or VI (indicating any lesion that was surgically evacuated or a mass lesion of more than 25 ml, respectively) (37.1% vs 33.2%)\npatients with a GCS motor score of 6 (7.9% vs 5.4%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nLiberal transfusion group\n\n369 patients were analysed in this group. Transfusion was triggered by a haemoglobin level of \u226410 g/dL\n98.9% of patients received at least 1 unit of packed cells with the median haemoglobin being 10.8g/dL\n\n\n\nControl\n\nRestrictive transfusion group\n\n367 patients were analysed in this group. Transfusion was triggered by a haemoglobin level of \u22647 g/dL\n38.4% of patients received at least 1 unit of packed cells with the median haemoglobin being 8.8g/L\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nTransfusion was initiated within 3 hours of the trigger haemoglobin level\n1 unit of leukodepleted packed cells were administered at a time\nMost patients had ICP monitoring\nFew patients had CBO2 monitoring and decompressive craniectomy\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nGOS-E at 6 months was <4 (unfavourable) in 68.4% in the liberal-strategy group and 73.5% in the restrictive-strategy group\nAdjusted absolute difference, restrictive strategy vs. liberal strategy, 5.4 percentage points; (95% CI, \u22122.9 to 13.7)\nFindings were consistent across subgroups and also with the worst, intermediate, and best predicted prognoses\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nComparing liberal vs. restrictive group\n\nNo significant difference in\n\nDeath in ICU (17.1% vs 15.3%), Death in Hospital (23% vs 21.5%), Death at 6 months (26.8% vs 26.3%)\n\n\nNo significant difference in functional independence measure or other measures of functional outcome\n\n\nTertiary Outcomes\n\nMedian (IQR) number of red-cell units transfused was 3 (2-5) in the liberal group and 0 (0-1) in the restrictive group\n\n\nSafety\n\n6 patients in the liberal group had a mild reaction to transfusion, 1 in the restrictive group\nVTE was the same in each group\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThere was no significant difference in GOSE at 6 months between those with liberal or restrictive transfusion following moderate or severe traumatic brain injury\n\nStrengths\n\nAllocation concealment, intention to treat analysis, minimal loss to follow-up\nMulti-centre study in various countries gives the study good external validity\nThere was a clear separation between the groups with median daily haemoglobin levels\nAlthough the bedside clinicians were unblinded, the outcome assessors of functional status were unaware of the allocation\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe trial was powered to detect a 10% difference in unfavourable outcome\nThe result showed a 5.4% difference which may be clinically significant\nThere were baseline differences between the two groups\nIt is possible there may be up to a 13.7% absolute reduction in risk of an unfavourable outcome with a liberal transfusion strategy\nThe statistical analysis has taken a frequentist approach. The authors are also planning a Bayesian Analysis\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nModern ICU practice has erred on the side of restrictive transfusion strategies based on mainly on the TRICC study which was published in the age of non-leukodepleted blood. In addition there were few patients with TBI in that landmark study\nThis study challenges the paradigm of following a restrictive transfusion regime in moderate-severe TBI patients.\nI keenly await the Bayesian Analysis\nI will aim closer to a haemoglobin of 10g/dL in this patient group\n\nExternal Links\n\nLiberal or Restrictive Transfusion Strategy in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury\nA multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial of Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford \u2013 @celiabradford\nSummary date: June 21 2024\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
