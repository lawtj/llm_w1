DOI:10:1056/NEJMoa1802637\nClinical Question\n\nFor surrogate decision makers of critically ill patients, does a multi-component family support intervention impact on the surrogates\u2019 hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) at 6 months?\n\nBackground\n\nIntensive care admissions are a psychologically taxing time for patients and their families. Residual grief and stress can persist well after the ICU admission particularly if the surrogate\u2019s loved one has died, has not returned to baseline function or is needing extra support from their family or community.\nCommunication between Intensive Care staff and families is often ad hoc, time-pressured and delivered by miscellaneous health care professionals.\nA study published in JAMA in 2016 reported a randomised trial of meetings with families with standard communication (ICU physicians) compared with extra palliative care-led meetings (meeting at Day 7 + Day 17) did not show any benefit to the HADS at 3 months and worsened symptoms of PTSD.\nA trial randomising families who had lost a loved one in ICU to receive a letter of condolence or standard care failed to reduce PTSD or improve satisfaction. Read the TBL summary of this Kentish-Barnes\u00a0trial.\nMulti-disciplinary support of families in crisis is a logical and inexpensive approach to communication but data is lacking as to how effective it is.\n\nDesign\n\nPARTNER = Pairing Re-engineered ICU Teams with Nurse-Driven Emotional Support and Relationship-Building\nMulticentre, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised trial\n5 different ICUs represented the unit of randomised\n\nEach started in the control phase which lasted a randomly assigned time\nEach unit then transitioned to the intervention phase\n\n\nTelephone interviews to the surrogates were conducted 6 months after the patient\u2019s hospital discharge by research staff who were unaware of the allocation\nThe surrogates provided written informed consent for their participation\nThe intervention was classified \u201cQuality Improvement\u201d whilst the surrogate follow-up was classified \u201cResearch\u201d\n\nSetting\n\n5 ICUs in 5 hospitals in the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre Health System\n\n2 medical-surgical ICU, 1 medical ICU, 1 specialising in neurologic illness, 1 specialising in transplant surgery\n\n\nPatient enrolment occurred between July 2012 and August 2015 with follow-up of surrogates ending in February 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Patients >18 years without decision-making capacity, with at least 1 of:\n\nVentilated (> 4 days),\nAn estimated chance of death of at least 40%, or\nEstimated chance of long-term impairment of at least 40%\n\n\nExclusion: no surrogate decision maker or patient receiving palliative treatment\n1420 patients: 547 in intervention arm, 873 in control arm\nThere were some baseline imbalances; those in the intervention group were older, had higher severity of acute illness scores and greater number of chronic comorbidities\n\nIntervention\n\nThe intervention had 3 main components:\n\nThe interprofessional team was overseen by 4-6 nurses (PARTNER nurses) who received advanced communication training focusing on supporting the families of the critically ill\nA PARTNER nurse would meet with the family/surrogate on a daily basis and arranged a clinician-family meeting within 48 hours of admission and every 5-7 days thereafter\nA quality-improvement specialist was utilised to incorporate the family-support pathway into the clinician\u2019s workflow\n\n\n\nControl\n\nUsual care (none of the ICUs had a protocolized approach to family communication)\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll other aspects of care were determined by the treating clinicians\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: The surrogates\u2019 symptoms of anxiety and depression as assessed by a HADS scale at 6 months, with scores ranging 0\u201342 with a higher score indicating worse symptoms\n\nUnadjusted and adjusted (detailed below) analysis: no difference\n\nIntervention: 11.7 +/- 7.9\nControl: 12.1 +/-8.5\nEstimated effect of intervention: -0.34 (95% CI -1.67 to 0.99; P = 0.61)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nThe IES score assessing PTSD; no significant difference intervention vs control \u00a0(P = 0.49)\nQOC score assessing clinician-family communication was significantly better in the intervention group (P = 0.001)\nPPPC score measuring the patient and family-centredness of care was significantly better in the intervention group (P = 0.006)\nThe ICU length of stay was shorter in the intervention group (P = 0.045), mediated by increased early mortality in the intervention group\n\n\nPatients\u2019 Clinical Outcomes: Intervention vs Control\n\nIn-hospital death: 38% vs 30.2% (P = 0.008)\nDeath at 6 months: 62% vs 54.1% (P = 0.17)\nLiving independently at home at 6 months: 1% vs 2.6% (P = 0.9)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong critically ill patients and their surrogates, a family-support intervention delivered by the existing interprofessional ICU team did not affect the surrogates\u2019 symptoms of depression and anxiety at 6 months, but the surrogates\u2019 ratings of the quality of communication and the patient- and family-centered-ness of care were better and the length of stay in ICU shorter with the intervention than with usual care.\n\nStrengths\n\nThe trial design (step-wedged, cluster-randomised design) is a clever way to assess the impact of a quality intervention where whole ICU care processes are changed\nHADS is a well validated measure of anxiety and depression\nThe effect of the intervention was examined from the perspective of patients, health care providers, surrogates and use of health care resources.\nAppropriate statistical adjustment given known baseline differences between intervention and control group\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOut of 1420 patients included only 57% completed the 6 month follow-up\n\nThe drop-out rates were similar between the intervention and the control group\nThe supplementary appendix suggests that there were a higher proportion of blacks who were lost to follow-up than not (9.9% vs 5.9%; P = 0.01)\nThis high loss to follow-up severely compromises this study\u2019s validity\n\n\nThere was significant baseline imbalance\n\nThis was corrected for in the adjusted analysis but may contribute to confounding bias\n\n\nAnalysis was by intention to treat, but this was only applied to those who agreed to be interviewed at 6 months, not all who were randomised\nThe study was conducted within the confines of the UPMC health system potentially limiting its external validity\nThere was no quantitative analysis of how the intervention changed the interactions with families, although there were regular site visits with the PARTNER nurses observed in their interactions with families\nThe reduced length of ICU stay (due to increased mortality in the intervention arm) is unlikely due to the communication bundle, but more likely due to the mismatch in the severity of the acute illness between the groups, as the difference is almost entirely due to more deaths in the intervention arm rather than live discharge\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAn interprofessional support package for families/surrogates of critically ill patients is a logical and cost-effective way to improve quality of communication and \u00a0patient and family centred support\nThe baseline imbalances and high loss to follow-up in this trial limit drawing conclusions from this intervention\nFurther trials with greater internal and external validity would add to this important area of ICU research\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0A Randomised Trial of a Family-Support Intervention in Intensive Care Units\n[further reading] Effect of Palliative Care-Led Meetings for Families fo Patients with Chronic Critical Illness: A Ranodmized Clinical Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0Effect of a Condolence letter on grief symptoms among relatives of patients who died in ICU: a randomised clinical trial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford\nSummary date: 8 August 2018\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
