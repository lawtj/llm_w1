Chest 2015;147(2):335-346. doi:10.1378/chest.14-1012\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock, is a single dose of etomidate for induction of anaesthesia, compared with any other induction, associated with a difference in mortality?\n\nDesign\n\nSystematic review and meta-analysis\nConducted in adherence to PRISMA\nTwo reviewers performed systematic review and data extraction\n\nPubMed, Embase and CENTRAL up to July 2014\nInclusion criteria:\n\nAdult populations\nSingle dose etomidate compared against any other sedative or no agent\nMortality as outcome\nRandomised, controlled trials or observational studies\n\n\n424 trials identified -> 20 full-text assessed -> N = 18 analysed in full\n\n\nPost-hoc randomised, controlled trial (RCT) data considered to be equivalent to observational studies\nSensitivity and publication bias analysis performed\n\nSetting of Trials\n\n10 in North America, 6 in Europe, 2 in Asia\nPublished between 2002 and 2014\n\nPopulation of Trials\n\nTrial sample sizes: n = 62 to 2014\nTotal population: 2801 etomidate group vs 2751 other sedatives group\n\nMethodology of Trials\n\n\n2 RCTs\n3 post-hoc analyses of RCTs\n10 retrospective cohort studies\n3 prospective cohort studies\n\n\nIntervention\n\nEtomidate single-dose\n\nSpecific details such as dose or indication are not provided\n\n\n\nControl\n\nAny other sedative agent\n\nRCT: ketamine (n=76)\nRCT: midazolam (n=120)\nCohort: midazolam (n=65)\nAll others: not specified\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: no statistically significant difference in mortality was shown by meta-analysis of the RCTs or cohort studies (performed separately)\n\nRCTs: risk ratio 1.20 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.72) favouring control but overlapping no effect\nCohorts: risk ratio 1.05 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.13) favouring control but overlapping no effect\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nInsufficient data prevented meta-analysis of resource use outcomes including length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation\nMeta-analysis of available data from 8 cohort studies found a statistically significant increase in adrenal insufficiency associated with etomidate compared to control\n\nRisk ratio 1.42 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.64)\n\n\n\n\nOther analyses:\n\nPublication Bias\n\nNo evidence of publication bias by funnel plot, and Begg\u2019s and Egger\u2019s tests\n\n\nRisk-of-Bias within publications\n\nRCTs were assessed as low (N=1) or unclear (N=1)\nCohort were assessed as low (N=10) or high (N=5)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with sepsis, a single-dose of etomidate was not associated with increased mortality. However, given the data come from two small RCTs and other observational studies with potentially significant biases, this conclusion is not certain and further trials should be performed.\n\nStrengths\n\nSystematically designed and conducted review following established PRISMA guidelines\nIdentified studies are recent and global\nSensitivity analysis performed\nDid not over emphasise the strength of data from post-hoc analysis of RCTs\n\nWeaknesses\n\nVarious drugs used as control for comparison\n\nKetamine in one RCT, midazolam in the other RCT, midazlolam in 1 retrospective cohort study\nAll other studies did not specify what the control for comparison was\nTherefore the conclusion is that etomidate is neither better nor worse than something else\n\n\nSecondary outcomes of resource use (length of stay and ventilation) could not be analysed due to the paucity of available data\nNo attempt was made to contact the authors of the original trials\n\nWith only 18 studies no older than 13 years, this would not have been unreasonably difficult\nAdditional data may have provided information regarding the control drug and resource use\nIndividual patient meta-analysis may provide stronger certainty about the conclusion\n\n\nAssessment of bias\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis meta-analysis did not find evidence of harm from single-dose etomidate, but the trials on which it is based are small and the comparators are not clearly defined.\nTherefore, whilst there are alternative agents for cardio-stable induction, this trial does not provide evidence to support etomidate use over and above these other agents.\nOf note, the conclusion in this paper contradicts other recent meta-analyses (see link below)\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Single-Dose Etomidate Does Not Increase Mortality in Patients with Sepsis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials and Observational Studies by Gu et al\n[further reading]\u00a0Rapid Sequence Intubation of the Shock Patient by LITFL\n[further reading]\u00a0Etomidate is associated with mortality and adrenal insufficiency in sepsis: a meta-analysis by Chan\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 24th April 2015\nPeer-review editor: @stevemathieu75\n\n\n"
