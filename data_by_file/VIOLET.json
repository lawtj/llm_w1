NEJM December 2019; doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1911124\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients with Vitamin D deficiency and a high risk of death, does early enteral replacement of Vitamin D3 compared with placebo improve survival at 90 days?\n\nBackground\n\nVitamin D has been suggested to be a potent immunomodulatory agent that is essential for lung development and function and may attenuate lung injury\nObservational data suggests that vitamin D deficiency is common in critically ill patients and represents a potentially modifiable risk factor\nVitamin D deficiency is associated with prolonged length of stay, organ failure, prolonged mechanical ventilation and death\nVitamin D is also associated with a number of chronic conditions and frailty, and the above findings may be more a reflection of these factors rather than vitamin deficiency alone\nIn a previous phase 2 trial (VITdAL-ICU) of 475 patients, vitamin D replacement in vitamin D deficient patients was associated with a non-significant reduction in mortality at 28 days compared to placebo. This larger phase 3 trial was designed to further test the hypothesis\n\nDesign\n\nDouble blinded, multi-centre, randomized control trial\nRandomized in 1:1 ratio stratified by site using a central electronic system and permuted blocks\nA p value of 0.05 was used as the cut-off for significance. The statistical analysis assumed that the mortality would be 20% and 15% in the control and intervention groups respectively. The trial was calculated to have 87% power if 3000 patients were randomized\nIntention to treat analysis\nTrial stopped after 1st interim analysis on basis of futility\n\nSetting\n\n44 hospitals in the USA (as part of the PETAL trials network)\nData collected and analysed from April 2017 to November 2019\n\nPopulation\nInclusion:\n\nAge \u2265 18 years\nWithin 12 hours after decision to admit to ICU\nAt least 1 acute risk factors for lung injury or mortality contributing directly to the need for ICU admission:\n\nPneumonia\nAspiration\nSmoke Inhalation/Lung contusion\nMechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure\nShock\nSepsis\nPancreatitis\n\n\nVitamin D deficiency \u2013 25OHD level <20 ng/mL\n\nrandomized on basis of screening test: either point of care test or test conducted by laboratory at enrolling hospital\nincluded in primary analysis on basis of confirmatory test: liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry tested at reference laboratory\n\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nUnable to take enteral medication\nBaseline hypercalcaemia (serum calcium >10.2 mg/dL (2.54 mmol/L) or ionized calcium >5.2 mg/dL (1.30 mmol/L))\nKnown kidney stone in past year or history of multiple (>1) prior kidney stone episodes\nDecision to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment (patients were still eligible if they are committed to full support except cardiopulmonary resuscitation if a cardiac arrest occurs)\nExpected <48 hour survival\nIf no other risk factors present, a) mechanical ventilation primarily for airway protection, pain/agitation control, or procedure; or b) elective surgical patients with routine postoperative mechanical ventilation; or c) anticipated mechanical ventilation duration <24 hours; or d) chronic/home mechanical ventilation for chronic lung or neuromuscular disease (non-invasive ventilation used solely for sleep-disordered breathing is not an exclusion)\n\nParticipants:\n\n15924 were assessed for eligibility, 1360 randomized after screened positive for vitamin D deficiency and met eligibility criteria\n1078 patients confirmed to have vitamin D deficiency\n1059 patients included in primary analysis (lost to follow up, n=19)\nRandomisation took place within the 12 hours (mean 6.7+-3.5) following decision to admit to ICU.\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. placebo group\n\nAge : 57 vs. 55\nFemale: 43% vs. 44%\nRace or ethnic group\n\nNon-hispanic white: 52% vs. 53%\nBlack: 24% vs. 23%\n\n\nAcute risk factor for death\n\nPneumonia: 38% vs. 34%\nShock: 36% vs. 37%\nSepsis: 34% vs. 32%\nMechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure: 22% vs. 22%\n\n\nTotal SOFA score: 5.6 vs. 5.4\n25-hydroxyvitamin D level: 11.2 vs. 11.0ng/ml\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nVitamin D (n=690)\n\nSingle dose of 540,000 international units of vitamin D3 given enterally\nAverage time to administration from randomization was 1.2 hours\n14 patients did not receive vitamin D\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo (n=668)\n\n17 patients did not receive placebo\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nNo other care was specified in each group, but the treating clinicians were strongly encouraged to not check a vitamin D level or prescribe any vitamin supplementation for a month following enrolment\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: All cause\u00a0 mortality at 90 days \u2013 no significant difference\n\n\n\n\n23.5% in Vitamin D group vs. 20.6% in control group\ndifference 2.9%, 95% C.I. -2.1 to 7.9, P = 0.26\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:There was no significant difference between intervention vs. control groups with regards to:\n\nLength of stay\n\n9.1 vs. 10.4 days (difference-1.4, 95% C.I. -2.7 to 0.0)\n\n\nVentilator Free days to day 28\n\n21.3 vs. 22.1 (difference -0.8, 95% C.I. -2.1 to 0.5)\n\n\nNew ARDS to day 7\n\n4.9% vs. 4.1% (difference 0.7, 95% C.I. -2.1 to 3.6)\n\n\nSeverity of respiratory failure\nAcute kidney injury\nNew renal replacement therapy to day 7\n\n4.1 vs. 3.6% (difference 0.5, 95% C.I. -1.9 to 2.9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary safety outcomes:\n\nThere was no significant difference between groups with regards to:\n\nHypercalcemia to day 7\n\n2.7% vs. 2.1%\n\n\nRenal stones to day 90\nFalls to day 90\nFall-related fractures to day 90\n\n\nThere was a significantly higher total calcium up to day 14 in the intervention group (p=0.004)\n\n\n\nAuthors Conclusions\n\nIn this phase three trial early administration of high dose Vitamin D3 did not provide an advantage over placebo with respect to 90-day mortality or other measures of non-fatal outcomes among critically ill patients with vitamin D deficiency.\n\nStrengths\n\nProspective multi centre double blinded RCT\nDiverse population\nImpressive early recruitment and treatment\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThis trial was made up of predominately medical patients whereas the previous phase 2 trial had a greater proportion of neurosurgical and surgical patients\nThe trial did measure response to treatment, and although this was impressive 24.8% of the intervention group still had a low vitamin D level (<30ng/ml) at day 3 (compared to 100% in control arm)\nThis trial did not examine patients who were vitamin D deficient at the later stages of their critical illness\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial does not provide evidence to support screening all critically ill patients for vitamin D deficiency, or that early replacement in those with vitamin D deficiency changes outcome\nThere may be sub-groups for which Vitamin D replacement may have a positive effect, but none were identified in this trial\nI will not routinely screen Critically ill patients for Vitamin D deficiency\n\n\u00a0\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Early High-Dose Vitamin D3 for Critically Ill, Vitamin D\u2013Deficient Patients\n[further reading]\u00a0LITFL: Vitamin D in Critical illness\n[further reading]\u00a0VITdA-ICU \u2013 TBL Review\n[Study Protocol] VITDALIZE study\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Joel Swindin @JSwindin\nSummary date: 8th April 2020\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\n\n\n"
