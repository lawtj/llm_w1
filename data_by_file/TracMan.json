JAMA 2013; 309:2121-2129. doi:10.1001/jama.2013.5154\n\nClinical Question\n\nIn mechanically ventilated adult patients with a high risk of prolonged ventilation, does early tracheostomy compared with late tracheostomy reduce mortality at 30 days?\n\nDesign\n\nLarge, multi-centre, randomised, controlled trial\nPilot study and national survey to estimate baseline prevalence\nBlock randomisation with minimisation algorithm to prevent imbalance between health centre, age, sex and 7 diagnostic groups\nClinicians, patients and data analysts not blinded\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nMultiple power calculations due to changing baseline and ultimately recruitment fatigue\n\nFinal recruitment was powered to detect 8.3% absolute reduction in 30-day mortality from a baseline of 31.5%, with 80% power and 5% accepted significance level.\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n70 adult, general Intensive Care Units across the UK\n\n13 university associated\n59 non-university associated\n\n\nNovember 2004 to November 2008\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Any intubated and ventilated adult patient where, on day 4, the treating clinician believes the patient will require at least 7 more days of ventilatory support\nExclusion: If a tracheostomy is already in situ, or one is required for specific patient management (e.g. airway obstruction); chronic hypercarbia from neurological disease\n3147 patients assessed of which 909 were randomised.\n\nIntervention\n\nPlacement of tracheostomy within 4 days of critical care admission\n\n84.6% received tracheostomy as planned\n14.5% not managed as planned because:\n\n6.8% never received a tracheostomy (died, too unstable, or recovered)\n7.7% received it \u2018late\u2019 (too unwell, no resources, transiently improved, trial error)\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacement of tracheostomy on or later than day 10, and only then if still deemed clinically indicated\n\n93.6% were managed as per trial protocol\n\n39.9% received tracheostomy on or later than day 10\n53.7% were deemed no longer indicated and did not receive a tracheostomy\n\n\n7.3% received tracheostomy before day 10 (clinical decision, insistence by relatives, trial error)\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: all-cause mortality at 30-days was not statistically different between the two groups\n\nEarly 30.8% vs late 31.5%\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nThere were no differences in survival at ICU discharge, hospital discharge, 1-year and 2-year follow-up\nDuration of mechanical ventilation favoured early tracheostomy but this did not reach statistical significance\n\nEarly 13.6 days vs late 15.2 days; reduction in mean duration 1.7 days; p=0.06\n\n\nMedian length of ICU stay were the same: early 13.0 days vs late 13.1 days\nOnly within the 30-day-surviving sub-group, there were statistically significantly fewer days of sedation administration in the early group: early 5 days vs late 8 days (p<0.001)\nAntibiotic use (as a proxy for hospital acquired infections) were not different between the two groups\n\n\nOther data:\n\nThe incidence of complications overall was 6.3% (95% CI 4.6\u20138.5%), of which bleeding requiring fluid administration was most common\n89% were percutaneous and 11% were surgically performed\nThe median duration of the procedures was 30 minutes\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn mechanically ventilated adult patients, there is no mortality benefit from performing an early tracheostomy.\n\nStrengths\n\nNational study with all centres invited to take part: excellent external validity\nRobust methodology\nMeaningful outcome with 2 year follow-up\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRecruitment fatigue led to lower than planned patient numbers\nDid not include patients requiring tracheostomy for non-respiratory reasons, such as neurological disease\nDid not look at long-term complications and morbidity associated with tracheostomy\nInclusion was reliant on clinicians identifying patients at high risk of prolonged ventilation, with no validated scoring system to assist decision making. This study shows that 19.6% recovered before day 10 in the late group, suggesting that clinician judgement is not good for this.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial does not provide evidence supporting early tracheostomies performed around day 4 compared to day 10 (no evidence of difference).\nTracheostomy procedures are associated with a 6.3% incidence of complications requiring interventions, which must be weighed against any potential benefit.\nMany commentators have interpreted this trial to mean there is no benefit from performing early tracheostomies (evidence of no difference), as many will not need it if we wait until day 10.\nHowever, some patients need tracheostomies for good reasons (e.g. neurological disease) and they were not included in this study.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[open access article]\u00a0Effect of Early vs Late Tracheostomy Placement on Survival in Patients Receiving Mechanical Ventilation\n[Trial website]\u00a0TracMan.org.uk\n[Editorial] When Should a Mechanically Ventilated Patient Undergo Tracheostomy by Angus\n[Further reading] Timing of Tracheostomy by LITFL\n[Further reading] CAT review.
