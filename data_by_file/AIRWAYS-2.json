JAMA 2018;320(8):779-791. doi:10.1001/jama.2018.11597\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, does a supraglottic airway device compared with tracheal intubation as the initial advanced airway management strategy, improve functional neurological outcome?\n\nBackground\n\nOptimal airway management during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is uncertain because there is very little high-quality research on which to base treatment recommendations\nThe advanced procedure of tracheal intubation has been considered a definitive airway management technique. However, the introduction of a supraglottic airway (SGA) device offers an alternative advanced airway management technique during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest\nInsertion of a SGA device is usually simpler and faster than tracheal intubation and proficiency requires less training and ongoing practice\nAnother\u00a0study (PART) assessing the effect of a strategy of initial laryngeal tube insertion versus endotracheal intubation on 72-Hour Survival in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was also published in the same issue of JAMA as AIRWAY-2\n\nDesign\n\nMulticenter, cluster randomised trial\nParamedics from 4 ambulance services in England\nEvery eligible patient treated by a participating paramedic was automatically enrolled in the study under a waiver of consent\nParamedics were randomised in a 1:1 ratio using a purpose- designed secure internet-based system. The computer- generated random sequence was done in advance using varying block sizes and stratified by EMS provider organisation, paramedic experience, and distance from the paramedic\u2019s base ambulance station to the usual destination hospital\nParamedic discretion with choosing the airway device was permitted and in fact was necessary to secure approval from the research ethics committee and professional support\n9070 patients in total were needed to detect a difference of 8% vs 10% at the significance level of 5% with 90% power after allowing for clustering. This was based on a previous feasibility study for mortality. There was no data available for the modified Rankin Scale score and an improvement of 2% in the proportion of patients achieving a good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score range, 0-3) was judged to be clinically important\n\nSetting\n\n4 ambulance services in England\u00a0which combined provide service to 21 million people\nJune 2015 and August 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Patients aged 18 years or older who had a non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and were treated by a\u00a0 paramedic participating in the trial\nExclusion: previously recruited to the trial (determined retrospectively); resuscitation deemed inappropriate; advanced airway already in place (inserted by another paramedic, physician, or nurse) when a paramedic participating in the trial arrived at the patient\u2019s side; known to be enrolled in another prehospital RCT; patient\u2019s mouth opened less than 2 cm\n9296 patients (4886 in the SGA group; 4410 in the Tracheal Intubation group) were enrolled; 4882 and 4407 patients respectively were included in the primary outcome analysis\nBaseline demographics were well matched:\n\nmedian age was 73 years\n3373 were women (36.3%)\nmedian time from emergency call to paramedic arrival within one minute between groups\npresenting rhythm (50% asystole; 22% VF)\nwitnessed cardiac arrest 63%\nCPR before paramedic arrival 63%\ndefibrillation before paramedic arrival 3%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nSupraglottic airway device used as initial advanced airway management\n\nSecond generation device with a soft non-inflatable cuff (i-gel; Intersurgical)\n\n82% patients received SGA device first\n15% did not receive airway management\n2.4% received tracheal intubation first\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nTracheal intubation used as initial advanced airway management\n\nperformed using direct laryngoscopy; video laryngoscopy is not used by paramedics in England\na 2-person technique using a bougie was recommended\n\n62% patients received tracheal intubation first\n22% did not receive airway management\n14% received SGA device first\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nThere was a standard approach to airway management (from basic to advanced techniques) which included the use of bag-mask ventilation and simple airway adjuncts prior to advanced airway management\nEnd-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring was used to confirm correct device placement in all patients.\nAll other care was delivered according to standard international resuscitation guidelines\nParamedics received additional training in their allocated advanced airway management intervention immediately after randomisation. Training comprised theoretical and simulation-based practice over 1 hour with a brief assessment to confirm competence\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: There was no statistical difference in the Modified Rankin Scale score at hospital discharge or 30 days after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, whichever occurred sooner\n\nIn the SGA group, 311 of 4882 patients (6.4%) had a good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score range, 0-3) vs 300 of 4407 patients (6.8%) in the TI group (adjusted risk difference [RD], \u22120.6% [95% CI, \u22121.6% to 0.4%])\n\n\n\nModified Rankin Scale score was divided into 2 ranges: 0-3 (good outcome) or 4-6 (poor outcome to death)\n\nSecondary outcomes, comparing SGA vs intubation\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nsurvival status: died at scene 53.7% vs 56.5%; survived to 30d or hospital discharge 8.0% vs 8.4%\nregurgitation: 26.1% vs 24.5%\naspiration: 15.1% vs 14.9%\nreturn of spontaneous circulation at arrival to ED or hospital: 30.6% vs. 28.4%\n\n\nSignificant difference in:\n\nInitial ventilation success (<=2 attempts at advanced airway management): 87.4% vs. 79.0%, p<0.001\nAny unintended loss of previously established airway: 10.6% vs. 5.0%, p<0.001\n\n\n\n\nSub-group analyses: In patients who received advanced airway management, more patients in the SGA device group had a good outcome\n\n163 of 4158 patients (3.9%) vs 88 of 3148 patients (2.6%); adjusted OR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.18 to 2.07]; risk difference, 1.4% [95% CI, 0.5% to 2.2%])\n\n\n\n \nReproduced with permission by Airways-2 Trial Investigators and \r\nWarwick Print\u00a0http://www.airways-2.bristol.ac.uk/\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, randomisation to a strategy of advanced airway management with a supraglottic airway device compared with tracheal intubation did not result in a favourable functional outcome at 30 days\n\nStrengths\n\nA large scale, pre-hospital trial that addresses an important clinical question regarding optimal airway device insertion in a very common presentation\nAn important patient focussed primary outcome measure was used\nAn excellent summary infographic released with the paper\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe trial population included patients who did and did not receive advanced airway management\nThe use of advanced airway management was greater among paramedics in the SGA device group compared with those in the tracheal intubation group, which could result in confounding by indication\nThere was an imbalance in the number of patients in the 2 groups\nThere was crossover between the two groups although the authors explain the important of allowing for this on practical and ethical grounds\nThe participating paramedics were volunteers, and their airway skills may not be representative of those who chose not to participate in the study\nAlthough other elements of care (eg, initial basic airway management and subsequent care, such as targeted temperature management and access to angiography) followed established guidelines, between group differences in these factors could have influenced the findings\nThe findings may not be applicable in countries with physician-led EMS provision or to another SGA device that may have different characteristics\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAmong patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, randomisation to a strategy of advanced airway management with a supraglottic airway device compared with tracheal intubation had a comparable functional neurological outcome at 30 days\nFamiliarity, competence, and proficiency with the airway device is arguably more important\nOver 1/3 of patients received no bystander CPR and only 322 of 2156 eligible patients (15%) received defibrillation before the paramedics arrived\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of a Strategy of a Supraglottic Airway Device vs Tracheal Intubation During Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest on Functional Outcome: The AIRWAYS-2 Randomized Clinical Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0Effect of a Strategy of Initial Laryngeal Tube Insertion vs Endotracheal Intubation on 72-Hour Survival in Adults With Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Randomized Clinical Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0JC: OOHCA and Airway management.
