Consistent inclusion criteria and protocol with ARISE study\nImportant outcome measures\nCost analysis and quality-adjusted life years an important outcome measure\nStudy population representative of critically ill patients with septic shock (mean APACHE II score 18. ARISE was 15)\nTrial statistical analysis plan was published prior to completion of the study\nAdherence to EGDT ranged from 86-95%\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOnly 1/3 of eligible patients were recruited. The authors acknowledge this and provide an explanation. As in all studies that enroll patients presenting to ED, recruitment is more challenging on weekends and during out of office hours\nNon blinded\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nProMISe does not demonstrate any difference in 90-day survival between usual care and strict EGDT in hospitals in England. Importantly, this study also demonstrates that EGDT is not cost effective.\nThis is a landmark paper and completes the international triumvarate of sepsis studies. ProMISE, ARISE and ProCESS have shown no benefit (or harm) with EGDT over \u2018usual care\u2019, unlike the Rivers study.\nBoth groups in this study were actually well matched for most interventions. The main difference was in the use of continuous\u00a0SCVO2\u00a0measurement and CVP to guide management. Perhaps we should not completely dismiss the term \u2018EGDT\u2019. Afterall,\u00a0 our \u2018usual care\u2019 consists of early intervention and goal directed therapy. The goal\u2026 to continue to reduce mortality with high standard and consistent quality care.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Full article] Trial of Early, Goal-Directed Resuscitation for Septic Shock\n[Supplementary material] Trial of Early, Goal-Directed Resuscitation for Septic Shock\n[Protocol] Trial of Early, Goal-Directed Resuscitation for Septic Shock\n[Further reading] Harmonizing international trials of early goal-directed resuscitation for severe sepsis and septic shock: methodology of ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe\n[Further reading] The Protocolised Management in Sepsis (ProMISe) trial statistical analysis plan\n[Blog] The ProMISe Study: EGDT RIP?
