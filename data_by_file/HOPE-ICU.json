It did reduce agitation and there was a trend towards decreased use of sedatives and analgesics when haloperidol was given. Other studies will need to tell us if haloperidol is a useful treatment once delirium has developed.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[open access pdf of article]\u00a0Effect of intravenous haloperidol on the duration of delirium and coma in critically ill patients (Hope-ICU): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial\n[Vodcast] Valerie Page performing CAM-ICU\n[Further reading]\u00a0ICUdelirium.org\n[Further reading]\u00a0Intensive Care Monitor \u2013 ICU madness\n[Further reading]\u00a0icudelirum.co.uk\n[Further reading]\u00a0NICE guideline\n[Further reading]\u00a0NICE Quality Standards for Delirium (July 2014)\n[Podcast]\u00a0ICS 2013: David Aaronovitch \u2013 Delirium in ICU\u00a0via\u00a0@ccpractitioner\n[Further reading]\u00a0Life in the Fast Lane\n[Further reading]\u00a0RASS score\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date: 26th August 2014\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@stevemathieu75\n\n\n"
