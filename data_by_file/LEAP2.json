JAMA 2019; Pubished online 27 September 2019. doi:10.1001/jama.2019.15468\nClinical Question\n\nIs 5-day oral lefamulin non-inferior to 7-day oral moxifloxacin in the management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia?\n\nBackground\n\nCommunity Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CABP) is a leading cause of hospitalization and death in the United States\nCurrent first-line treatments include macrolides, \u03b2-lactams, and fluoroquinolones\nLefamulin is the first pleuromutilin antibiotic approved for intravenous and oral use in humans\n\nMechanism of action: inhibition of protein synthesis via interactions with ribosomal RNA\n\n\nLEAP1 demonstrated non-inferiority of lefamulin to moxifloxacin in moderate to severe CABP when initiated intravenously\n\nDesign\n\nPhase 3, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group randomized clinical trial\nPatients were randomized 1:1 with block size of 6 and stratified based on Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) risk class, geographic region, and prior receipt of short-acting antibiotic therapy for CABP\nIntention to treat (ITT) design included all randomized patients\nAdditional population analyses:\n\nModified ITT population: received any amount of study drug\nClinically evaluable population: at least 48 hours of study drug, no other antibacterial drugs, did not have indeterminate clinical response, and no other confounding factors\nMicrobiological ITT population: as per ITT population where pathogen identified\n\n\nA sample size of 738 patients randomized 1:1 provided 90% power to establish lefamulin non-inferiority to moxifloxacin for early clinical response (US Food and Drug Administration)\n\n79% responder rate in both treatment groups for the ITT population\n10% noninferiority margin\n1-sided \u03b1 level of .025\n\n\nA similar power was achieved for the co-primary outcome of investigator-assessed clinical response in the modified ITT (European Medicines Agency)\nAuthors based the non-inferiority margin of 10% on observational studies which estimated a 20% effect size of no treatment vs antibacterial therapy\n\n10% margin preserves 50% of treatment effect\nConsistent with US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency guidelines\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n99 sites in 19 countries throughout Europe, North America, South America, Asia, and Africa\nAugust 2016, to January 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdult patients with PORT risk class II, III, or IV radiographically documented pneumonia\nAcute illness (\u22647 days)\n3 or more CABP symptoms (dyspnea, new or increased cough, purulent sputum production, and chest pain)\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nMore than 1 dose of a short-acting oral or intravenous antibacterial for CABP within 72 hours before randomization\nHospitalization for 2 days or longer within 90 days\nConfirmed or suspected methicillin-resistant S. aureus\nAt risk of major cardiac events or dysfunction\nSignificant hepatic disease\n\n\n738 randomized patients\n\n685 completed treatment\n\n\nMean duration of exposure to treatment\n\n5.0 days for lefamulin\n6.7 days for moxifloxcin\n\n\nMost commonly isolated pathogens\n\nS. pneumoniae:\u00a063.7%\nH. influenzae: 26.6%\nAtypicals (M. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, and C. pneumonia): 22.3%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nLefamulin\n\n600 mg orally every 12 hours for 5 days\nPlus oral moxifloxacin placebo every 24 hours for 7 days\n\n\n\nControl\n\nMoxifloxacin\n\n400 mg orally every 24 hours for 7 days\nPlus oral lefamulin placebo every 12 hours for 5 days\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nClassifications for US FDA Primary Outcome:\n\nResponder\n\nAlive, showed improvement in 2 or more of the 4 CABP symptoms, had no worsening of any CABP symptom, or did not receive a non-study antibacterial for the current CABP episode\n\n\nNon-responder\n\nDid not meet above criteria\n\n\nIndeterminate\n\nLost to follow up or missing data on criteria\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary outcome:\u00a0defined by US Food and Drug Administration\n\nEarly clinical response at 96 hours (within a 24-hour window) after receipt of first dose of either study drug in the ITT population\nLefamulin: 90.8%\nMoxifloxacin: 90.8%\nAbsolute Difference: 0.1% (1-sided 97.5% CI: -4.4% to \u221e)\n\n\nCo-primary outcomes:\u00a0defined by\u00a0European Medicines Agency)\n\nInvestigator-assessed clinical response at test of cure (5-10 days after last dose of study drug) in the modified ITT population\n\nLefamulin: 87.5%\nMoxifloxacin: 89.1%\nDifference: -1.6% (1-sided 97.5% CI: -6.3% to \u221e)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nInvestigator-assessed clinical response at test of cure (5-10 days after last dose of study drug) for the clinically evaluable population\n\nLefamulin: 89.7%\nMoxifloxacin: 93.6%\nDifference: -3.9% (1-sided 97.5% CI: -8.2% to \u221e)\n\n\n\n\nAdverse Outcomes\n\nOverall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 32.6% with lefamulin and 25.0% with moxifloxacin\n\nLefamulin group\n\nDiarrhea (12.2%)\nNausea (5.2%)\nVomiting (3.3%)\nGastrointestinal-relate treatment-emergent adverse events (17.9%)\nHepatobiliary events (1.1%)\nCardiac events (2.2%)\nMean QTcF change from baseline at steady state 9.5 ms\nOne patient\u2019s QTc interval increased from 440.3 ms at baseline to a maximum of 490 ms on day 5 (study drug discontinued)\nOne case of C. diff in patient successfully treated who then remained hospitalized for five days, resolved with oral vancomycin\n\n\nMoxifloxacin group\n\nNausea (1.9%)\nHeadache

Conclusions\n\n\u201cThis study demonstrated the non-inferiority of oral lefamulin to oral moxifloxacin for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.\u201d\n\nStrengths\n\nAppropriate design to answer the clinical question\nNon-inferiority methodology allows an efficient study and appropriate conclusion\nRandomisation method and prior-concealment prevents recruitment bias\nStratification and block randomisation reduces uneven allocation by play of chance\nStudy sponsors were blinded to treatment allocation unless unblinding was necessary for medical management\nThe study used CABP end points defined by regulatory bodies in the United States and in Europe\nSponsor did not have the right to veto or suppress publication\nAppropriate comparator drug (moxifloxacin) and duration\n\nWeaknesses\n\nBias may have been introduced as the study sponsors were responsible for the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; and preparation and review of the manuscript\nResults of some secondary endpoints were not reported\nUsually Intention-To-Treat (ITT) analysis is appropriate for superiority trial designs and Per-Protocol (PP) analysis is appropriate for non-inferiority trial design\n\nThis trial used multiple populations and analyses, and the conclusions were in agreement, so this is unlikely to have resulted in a false conclusion\nITT tends to minimise differences and PP tends to exaggerate differences \u2013 when testing for\u00a0no difference, the analysis should try to exaggerate any differences so that a conclusion of\u00a0no difference\u00a0is robustly proven\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 self-reported limitations\n\nBroad exclusion criteria may limit generalizability to certain sub-populations\nLimited MIC data due to non-culture identification of many pathogens\nSample not tested for viral pathogens\nPatients with suspected MRSA were excluded due to poor coverage with moxifloxacin\nOverall recovery of resistant pathogens was low\nRace/ethnicity designation may have been misclassified based on potentially inconsistent data collection methodology\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDespite the potential sources of bias, this seems to be a generally well-designed study\nOral lefamulin appears to be efficacious for the treatment of CABP, albeit with a higher rate of adverse reactions, as demonstrated by this non-inferiority trial\nCost may be a barrier, as lefamulin will be priced at $200-300 per day of treatment\nLefamulin likely represents a valuable addition to our arsenal of antibiotics against CABP, but given its status of non-inferiority (and not superiority), antimicrobial stewardship may dictate that it should be reserved if possible to avoid developing resistance\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Oral Lefamulin vs Moxifloxacin for Early Clinical Reponse Among Adults With Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia\n[further
