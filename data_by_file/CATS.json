Lancet 2007; 676-84.\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with septic shock, is mortality affected by the use of adrenaline (epinephrine) alone in comparison to noradrenaline\u00a0\u00b1 dobutamine?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\nRandomised centrally to achieve allocation concealment\nBlock randomisation, stratified by centre\nTriple blinded\nIntention to treat analysis\n\nSetting\n\n19 ICUs in France\n12.10.1999. \u2013 31.12.2004.\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nevidence of infection for <7 days and 2 SIRS critieria\nat least 2 of the following: PaO2/FiO2 <280mmHg (if ventilated), urine output <0.5ml/kg for >1hr, lactate >2mmol/l, platelet <100\nand all 3 of the following for <24hrs\n\nsystolic BP <90 or MAP <70\nadministration of fluid bolus of \u2265 1000ml+ or capillary wedge pressure 12-18mmHg\nneed for >15\u03bcg/kg/min dopamine or any dose or adrenaline/noradrenaline\n\n\n\n\nMajor Exclusion Criteria: Pregnancy, obstructive cardiomyopathy, acute MI/PE\n330 randomised out of 1591 who were assessed for eligibility\nThe source of sepsis was lung primary in around 50% of patients (abdominal in 25%)\n\nIntervention\n\nAdrenaline + placebo\n\nControl\n\nNoradrenaline + dobutamine (whenever needed)\n\n\nIn both intervention group and control group the use of adrenaline/noradrenaline and dobutamine/placebo was set by a pre-determined protocol shown below\n\nIs MAP inadequate? If yes -> are they underfilled? If yes -> give fluids\nIs MAP inadequate? If yes -> are they underfilled? If No -> check cardiac output (by whatever means) -> if ok then increase vasopressors; if not increase dobutamine (or placebo in the control group)\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: All cause 28 day mortality \u2013 no significant difference\n\n40% in adrenaline group vs. 34% in noradrenaline\u00a0+ dobutamine group, (RR 0.86, 95% C.I. 0.65-1.14, P=0.31)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nNo significant difference in rate of severe arrhythmias, myocardial events, length of stay and time to pressor withdrawal\nLactate significantly increased in adrenaline group at day 1 only (P=0.003); pH significantly lower in adrenaline group from day 1-4\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nPhysicians could use either adrenaline alone or noradrenaline \u00b1 dobutamine in patients with septic shock\n\nStrengths\n\nTriple blinded\nPre-determine protocol for use pressors/dobutamine\nIntention to treat analysis with minimal loss to follow up\nConsidered specific concomitant therapy including, APC, steroids, adequacy of initial antibiotics and renal replacement therapy. These were well matched although no statistical data was conducted\nNo conflict of interest declared. Supported by the French Ministry of Health\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNumber of patients excluded \u2013 98 due to physician refusal and 409 due to \u2018other reasons\u2019\nBased on results found, the study had a power of 85% to detect an absolute reduction of 15% mortality, from a baseline mortality of 40%. A benefit as great as this is probably unrealistic and there could still be large differences that this trial was not powered to detect\nNo mention of time to antibiotic therapy although standard treatment and adequate initial antibiotic cover similar\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThere was no significant difference found between the use of adrenaline vs. noradrenaline\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0dobutamine in patients with septic shock. However, the study was under-powered and with a trend towards harm in the adrenaline group, highlights the need to conduct larger studies before considering adrenaline as the first agent for the management of septic shock. I will continue to reach for noradrenaline for patients with septic shock. The study does provide some reassurance that adrenaline infusion is a reasonable alternative in the early phase of shock or in resource limited settings.\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf\u00a0/\u00a0abstract\u00a0/ doi:\u00a010.1016/S0140-6736(07)61344-0\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\nCatecholamine treatment for shock \u2013 equally good or bad?\u00a0Lancet 2007\nChoice of vasopressor in septic shock: does it matter?
