This may have led to a number of patients without shock receiving large fluid boluses.\u00a0\nChange of study protocol halfway through study\nConcerns over external validity (applying this trial to the population that I see)\n\nUsing a transfusion threshold of 5 meant that a number of patients were significant anaemia were given large volume of fluids leading to haemodilution. We are not told if patients had their haemoglobin re-measured post fluid bolus.\u00a0\nLarge number of patients had malaria, that is characterised by obstruction of the microcirculation with infected erythrocytes. Fluid boluses have little effect and can increase the risk of complications (see the review in the external links for more info)\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn an African setting, febrile children with impaired perfusion, had an increased mortality if they were treated with a fluid bolus compared with no fluid bolus. The population studied had a high incidence of malaria and severe anaemia. They were managed with a low transfusion threshold and without critical care facilities. This is very different to the population that I manage. Therefore I do not think that these results can be applied to my patients.\u00a0\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0Mortality after Fluid Bolus in African Children with Severe Infection\n[open access pdf of article]\u00a0Mortality after Fluid Bolus in African Children with Severe Infection\n[Further reading]\u00a0LITFL: Own the FEAST\n[Further reading]\u00a0The fluid management of adults with severe malaria\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date: 21st June 2015\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@stevemathieu75\n\n\n"
