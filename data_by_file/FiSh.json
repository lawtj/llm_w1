Arch Dis Childhood 2018; Online first 07 Aug 2018. doi: 0.1136/archdischild-2018-314924\nClinical Question\n\nIn children with septic shock, does a restricted fluid bolus volume, compared with a standard fluid bolus volume, improve outcomes?\n\nBackground\n\nRapid liberal fluid bolus therapy for paediatric septic shock is standard practice in high income countries\nThe FEAST trial, set in Africa,\u00a0demonstrated an increased mortality with this approach\nNo previous RCTs have compared restrictive vs. standard fluid boluses in a high income country\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n1:1 randomisaiton\nOpen-label\nPilot RCT without defined primary outcome, hence without usual power calculation\nIntention to treat analysis\n\nSetting\n\n4 regional hospitals and 9 district general hospitals in England\nAcute assessment area (e.g paediatric assessment unit or ED)\nData collected: July 2016 \u2013 April 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAge: older than 37 weeks corrected gestational age and < 16 years\nClinical suspicion of infection\nShock: age-adjusted systolic BP <5th centile and/or capillary refill time (CRT) >= 3s after 20ml/kg of bolus fluid\n\n\nExclusion: Prior receipt of >20ml/kg bolus fluid, conditions in which bolus fluid resuscitation should be curtailed; full active resuscitation not within current goals of care\n75 patients randomised\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control groups\n\nMedian age in months (IQR): 11 (1-35) vs. 2 (1-17)\nMale: 62% vs. 53%\nMedian weight in kgs (IQR): 9 (5-13) vs. 5 (4-10)\nShock criteria\n\nCRT only: 77% vs. 88%\nHypotension only: 5% vs. 6%\nCRT & hypotension: 3% vs. 6%\nNeither: 15% vs. 0%\n\n\nPaediatric Index of Mortality 2 score: 2.1 vs. 2.0\nInfection confirmed: 51% vs. 50%\n\nBacterial infection: 31% vs. 50%\nViral infection: 63% vs. 50%\nMalaria: 6% vs. 0%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n\n\nRestrictive fluid boluses (n=39)\n\n10ml/kg bolus (500ml maximum)\n8% of patients did not receive their 1st bolus because deemed no longer required fluid bolus post randomisation\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard fluid bolus (n=34)\n\n20ml/kg (1000ml maximum)\nAll patients received their 1st fluid bolus\nOf their subsequent boluses, 1 patient received a fluid bolus when the shock criteria were not met, and 2 patients did not receive a bolus when the shock criteria were met\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\n4 hour resuscitation period. One fluid bolus given at 15 minutes intervals\nAt end each 15 minutes, if age adjusted signs of shock persisted then another bolus given\nif no signs of shock or patient developed signs of fluid overload (pulmonary oedema, new/increasing hepatomegaly) then fluid boluses were witheld\nFluid type and other interventions at discretion of treating clinician\nAfter 4 hour resuscitation period treatment at discretion of treating clinician\n\nOutcome\n\nOutcomes \u2013 comparing intervention vs. control group\n\nTotal volume study fluid, mean (SD) during\n\n1st hour: 13.5ml/kg (8) vs. 20.7ml/kg (8.3)\n1st 4 hours: 14.5ml/kg (11.1) vs. 25.7ml/kg (12), p<0.001\n\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nNumber of fluid boluses administered\n\n0: 8% vs. 0%\n1: 59% vs. 74%\n2: 21% vs. 18%\n3: 8% vs. 3%\n>3: 5% vs. 6%\n\n\nBolus given within 15 minutes: 81% vs. 68%\nMortality at 30 days: 0% vs. 0%\nSerious adverse events: 0% vs. 0%\nAdmitted to PICU: 26% vs. 32%\nMechanical ventilation: 11% vs. 25%\nReceipt of inotropes: 3% vs. 16%\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nA larger FiSH trial with the current design in the UK is not feasible\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nMulti-centre\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPilot study, no primary outcome or power calculation\nOpen-label\nSmall number of patients included with significant baseline differences\n6 patients recruited who did not meet inclusion criteria- All randomised to intervention arm\nLack of equipoise among some clinicians identified during interviews with staff, favouring restrictive fluid boluses due to concerns over fluid overload\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPaediatric patients with septic shock in the UK\u00a0who were randomized to a restrictive fluid bolus strategy received less fluids that patients randomized to a standard fluid bolus\nNo significant differences were seen in any of the patient centred outcomes studied in this pilot trial\nA low level of severe illness in the population studied means that detecting differences in mortality would not be feasible with a larger trial in the UK\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Restricted fluid bolus volume in early septic shock: results of the Fluids in Shock pilot trial \n[further reading] Mortality after fluid bolus in African Children with Severe infection\n[further reading] Exploring mechanisms of excess mortality with early fluid administration: insights from the FEAST trial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date: 12th September 2018\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0Segun Olusanya\n\n\n"
