JAMA 2012;(307)11:1165-1168\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with out-of-hospital (OOH) cardiac arrest is the use of adrenaline, compared to not using adrenaline, associated with an improved mortality?\n\nDesign\n\nProspective\nNon-randomised\nCohort study with concurrent control group\n\nSetting\n\nPre-hospital services, Japan\n01.01.2005-31.12.2008\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: adult patients who had an OOH cardiac arrest prior to arrival of emergency services\nExclusion: >60 minutes elapsed from call to scene arrival or >480 minutes from call to hospital arrival; missing data on adrenaline administration\n417 188 patients\n\nIntervention\n\nPatients treated with epinephrine\n\nFrom April 2006 certified paramedics were permitted to use adrenaline which led to the development of the intervention and the control group\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPatients not treated with adrenaline\n\nOutcome\n\nComparing patients who received adrenaline with patients who did not receive adrenaline:\n\n\u00a0the Odds Ratios (95% C.I.) were the following for:\n\nReturn of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) before hospital arrival\n\nunadjusted OR 3.75 (3.59-3.91)\nadjusted OR 2.36 (2.22-2.5)\n\n\nSurvival at 1 month\n\nunadjusted OR 1.15 (1.07-1.23)\nadjusted OR 0.46 (0.42-0.51)\n\n\nGood neurological outcome (CPC 1 or 2)\n\nunadjusted OR 0.61 (0.53-0.7)\nadjusted OR 0.31(0.26-0.36)\n\n\n\n\nSimilar results were found in a propensity matched subgroup (n=26,802)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nUse of prehospital adrenaline was significantly associated with increased ROSC but decreased chance of survival and good functional outcome\n\nStrengths\n\nHuge numbers of patients\nSimilar results found when analysed with different models\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNon-randomised\nBaseline characteristics generally favour adrenaline group with greater rates of bystander CPR (45% vs. 36%), use of public AED (0.8% vs. 0.4%), VF/VT (13.7% vs. 7.2%)\nData on in-hospital CPR not included in analysis\nNumber of adrenaline doses given not recorded\nIncluded pre-hospital cardiac arrests only\nOne month survival influenced by in-hospital care which varies between centres\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study found an association between the use of adrenaline for cardiac arrest, and decreased survival as well as a poor neurological outcome. It is a non-randomised study, but with >400,000 patients included it needs to be taken seriously. If this was a \u2018new drug\u2019 it would not be included in any guideline, and is perhaps currently still only in the guidelines because it is something that \u2018we have always done\u2019!\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf / abstract / doi: 10.1001/jama.2012.294\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\nEMCrit Blog.
