DOI: 10.1956/NEJMoa1714855\nClinical Question\n\nIn infants (<12 months) with bronchiolitis and hypoxaemia (saturations <92%) in the emergency department or general paediatric ward, does early treatment with high flow therapy versus standard oxygen therapy result in fewer infants having treatment failure that leads to escalation of care?\n\nBackground\n\nBronchiolitis is the most common reason for non-elective hospital admissions in infants with an associated population based increase in admissions to the intensive care unit (17.1% on non elective PICU admission in Australia in 2013)\nThere are currently no disease modifying therapies for the management of bronchiolitis\nA 2017 study suggested that high flow nasal prong (HFNP) did not reduce time on oxygen when compared with standard therapy (Kepreotes et al; Lancet 2017)\nThe clinical effectiveness of high flow therapy in decreasing intensive care admissions and/or the need for intubation has only been reported in non-experimental observational studies\n\nDesign\n\nA non-blinded, multicentre randomised controlled trial\nConsent was written and either prospective or deferred (except in one centre where deferred consent was not approved)\nRandomisation was performed via a computer generated randomisation sequence in blocks of 10, with stratification according to the participating centre\nSequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes (in a 1:1 ratio) were opened when the eligibility criteria were met\nAll investigators remained unaware of the trial outcome until all data was locked at the end of trial in December 2016\nSample size required: 582 participants per group, assuming a baseline treatment failure rate of 10% (based on a pilot in 2011) and a 50% relative reduction to 5% with power of 90% and type 1 error of 0.05. This meant that the chance of a type II error was 10%\n\nSetting\n\n17 Hospitals: 6 tertiary and 11 regional/metropolitan in Australia and New Zealand\n8 hospitals have onsite intensive care services for children <12 months.\nOctober 2013 \u2013 August 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: \n\nPatients <12 months (corrected) with clinical signs of bronchiolitis and the need for supplemental oxygen\nSupplemental oxygen was required to keep saturations in the range of:\n\n92-98% in tertiary hospitals (6)\n94-98% in regional hospitals (10) and 1 tertiary level\n\n\n\n\nExclusion: \n\nImmediate need for respiratory support and ICU admission\nInfants with cyanotic heart disease\nInfants with base of skull fracture\nInfants with upper airway obstruction\nInfants with craniofacial malformations\nInfants receiving supplemental oxygen therapy at home\n\n\n20795 infants <12 months of age with respiratory disease screened\n\n18578 excluded\n\n11081 bronchiolitis but no oxygen requirement\n156 direct admission to intensive care\n7341 other respiratory illness\n\n\n2217 infants eligible for inclusion\n\n44 declined immediate consent\n535 missed opportunity for enrolment\n\n\n1638 (74%) underwent randomisation\n\n166 declined deferred consent\n\n\n1472 infants included in analyses\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nHigh flow oxygen therapy\n\nFlow of 2l/kg/min to a maximum of 25l/min (ideal body weight)\n\n\nWeaning of therapy:\n\nCease if able to maintain saturations in target range for > 4hours with FIO2 0.21\n\n\nFeeding in High flow therapy group: nasogastric inserted and vented every 4 hours, no oral feeding was allowed unless in stable weaning phase\n\nControl\n\nStandard therapy\n\nSupplemental oxygen to a maximum of 2l/min to maintain saturations 92-98% (94-98%)\nMay or may not be humidified\n\n\nWeaning of therapy:\n\nCease if able to maintain saturations in target range for >4hours on air\n\n\nFeeding as per clinician\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nThe remainder of medical treatment was at the discretion of clinicians i.e. use of steroids, antibiotics, antipyretics, bronchodilators and hypertonic saline\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: treatment failure occurred in:\n\nStandard oxygen therapy: 167 out of 733 (23%)\nHigh flow therapy: 87 out of 739 (12%)\nRisk difference -11 percentage points; (95% confidence interval (CI) -15 to -7; p < 0.001)\n\nNumber needed to treat to prevent one treatment failure = 9\nFragility Index = 51\n\n\n\n\n\nEscalation of care due to treatment failure was defined as meeting \u2265 3 of the following 4 clinical criteria: 1) Heart rate remains unchanged or has increased 2) Respiratory rate remains unchanged or has increased 3) Oxygen required \u2265 49% in high flow therapy arm or >2l/min in standard oxygen therapy arm to maintain saturations in target range 4) Medical review triggered by hospital early-warning tool\u00a0or clinical judgement can override protocol if decision is made to escalate care\n\nSecondary outcomes (Standard therapy vs. high flow oxygen):\u00a0No significant difference in:\n\nNumber of admissions/transfers to ICU\n\n9% vs. 12% (OR 1.37; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.95; p 0.08)\n\n\nDuration of stay in ICU\n\n2.72 vs. 2.63 days (Mean Difference -0.09; 95% CI -0.74 to 0.55; p = 0.78)\n\n\nDuration of hospital stay\n\n2.94 vs. 3.12 days (OR 0.18; 95% CI -0.09 to 0.44; p =0.19)\n\n\nDuration of oxygen therapy\n\n1.87 vs. 1.81 days (Mean difference -0.06; 95% CI -0.28 to 0.16; p = 0.61)\n\n\nIntubation rate\n\n1% vs. 1% (OR 1.99; 95% CI 0.6 to 6.65; p = 0.39)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdverse Events\n\nNo differences between standard therapy and high flow therapy\n\nApnoeas: 3 in each group\nPneumothorax: 1 in each group\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong infants with bronchiolitis who were treated outside of an ICU, those who received high-flow oxygen therapy had significantly lower rates of escalation of care due to treatment failure than those in the group that received standard therapy\n\nStrengths\n\nThis study attempted to answer an important clinical question to a common paediatric problem.\nThis was a large, multicentre RCT that was adequately powered to detect an absolute reduction in treatment failure of 5%\nThe blocked randomization process meant that the intervention and control arms were well-balanced at baseline\nTreatment failure was based on objective measurements of clinical deterioration in over 60% of patients\nThe secondary endpoints included patient-centred outcomes, such as ICU admission and hospital length of stay\nThe study incorporated a pragmatic study design that reflected current clinical practice\nInvestigators were blinded to the trial outcome until the final data analysis was complete\nPrespecified subgroup analysis was performed for premature infants, those with previous hospital admissions and with congenital heart disease. In addition, hospitals with and without an ICU were analysed separately\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThis was an unblinded study as the intervention could not be masked\nThe primary outcome was a composite outcome that may be of limited clinical relevance\nThere was a risk of selection bias, with 533 of 2217 potential participants missing the \u00a0opportunity for enrolment\nIt was unclear what happened to the HFNP therapy group after treatment failure and ICU admission\nClinicians could escalate if they were clinically concerned, even if patients did not meet the four predefined clinical criteria. This occurred in 34% of cases; 52 (31%) in standard oxygen group vs 34 (39%) in high flow therapy group. As a result, detection bias cannot be excluded\nHigh flow therapy is standard practice in Australia/NZ for more severe bronchiolitis \u2013 preconception can effect decision making a demonstrated by all patients in the standard therapy group who experienced treatment failure being escalated to high flow oxygen therapy\nThere was a higher respiratory rate in the high flow oxygen therapy group at the time of escalation. This may have indicated a lower threshold for physicians to declare treatment failure in the standard oxygen arm\nThere was a difference between regional/metropolitan and tertiary centres regarding the percentage of infants requiring escalation of therapy. In addition, there was a difference in escalation rates between hospitals that had an ICU versus hospitals with no ICU. This again raises the suspicion of differing thresholds for management escalation between clinicians and institutions\nThere was no control on the other therapies employed that may affect escalation of therapy. For example, sedation was used in 35 (standard oxygen therapy) and 49 (high flow therapy). In addition, feeding was not protocolised or described in the standard oxygen therapy group\nThere was possibly an underestimation of adverse events, As part of the study participating centres received large amounts of education and supervision regarding high flow therapy. This may have resulted in an underestimate of adverse events and may limit the external validity of the study\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study shows that the majority (77%) of children with hypoxia and bronchiolitis treated with standard oxygen therapy will not require any escalation of therapy. In those that do require escalation, more than half of these patients will only require escalation to high flow therapy\nRescue high flow therapy, following clinical deterioration with standard therapy, is beneficial\nIn this study High flow therapy did not have more adverse events and therefore may be suitable for ward use with appropriate education and support\nMy current practice is to use high flow therapy only as rescue therapy in the hypoxic infant with bronchiolitis and I will not change my practice based on this study\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0A Randomized Trial of High-Flow Oxygen Therapy in Infants with Bronchiolitis.
