Critical Care Medicine 2017;45(5)766-776. doi:10.1097/CCM.0000000000002283\nClinical Question\n\nIn cancer patients with septic shock does a restrictive vs. a liberal transfusion threshold reduce 28 day mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nA number of papers have investigated what transfusion threshold we should use in critically ill patients. The TRICC study included critically ill patients with acute anaemia, and\u00a0the TRISS study included patients with septic shock. Both studies reported that a restrictive strategy was safe and reduced blood transfusions. Where as the TRISOP study reported that the composite outcome of mortality and major complications was reduced with a liberal threshold in surgical oncology patients. There is the additional concern of the association of blood transfusion with cancer progression. This study was therefore\u00a0performed to try and determine what transfusion threshold we should use in oncology patients with septic shock.\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nAllocation through internet based system\nPatients and outcome assessors blinded\nTreating clinicians non blinded\nIntention to treat analysis\nSample size calculation\n\n300 patients required to give 80% power to detect a reduction in mortality from 50% in liberal\u00a0to 34% in restrictive with false positive rate of 5%\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nSingle tertiary centre, Brazil\nData collected June 2012 \u2013 May 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria \u2013 Oncological patients with septic shock\n\nAdult patients\nDiagnosis of solid cancer\nSeptic shock within 1st 6 hours of ICU admission\n\nSuspected or verified infection with mean arterial pressure <65mmHg despite fluid therapy requiring vasopressors\n\n\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nInability to receive blood transfusions\nToo high expected mortality or transfusion rate\nHaematological malignancy\nEnd-stage renal failure\n\n\n1,658 patients screened of whom 300 enrolled\nComparing liberal vs. restrictive groups\n\nAge: 62 vs. 61\nCo-morbidities\n\nDiabetes: 20% vs. 19%\nCOPD 9% vs 6%\nCongestive heart failure: 7% vs. 5%\n\n\nType of tumour\n\nGastro-intestinal tract: 52% vs. 59%\nLung: 15% vs. 13%\n\n\nChemotherapy 4 week before ICU admission: 26% vs. 22%\nRadiotherapy 4 week before ICU admission: 5% vs. 4%\nSite of infection\n\nLung: 69% vs. 61%\n\n\nPositive cultures\n\n28% vs. 34%\n\n\nSAPS III score: 55 vs. 59\nSOFA score: 6 vs. 7\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nRestrictive strategy\n\nPatients received 1 unit of RBCs each time Hb <7g/dL\n41% of patients had RBC transfusion\nUnits of RBC transfused, median (IQR): 0 (0-2)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nLiberal transfusion\n\nPatients received 1 unit of red blood cells each time Hb <9g/dL\n61% of patients had RBC transfusion\nUnits of RBC transfused, median (IQR): 1(0-3)\n\n\n\nFor both intervention and control groups\n\nHaemoglobin levels checked on ICU admission, twice daily, and following transfusion\nRBCs were leukodepleted\nIntervention only performed during ICU stay.

However the\u00a0difference reported\u00a0between the 2 treatments groups was 11.6%. This is still clinically significant and would have required a larger study to be powered to detect this difference.\nSome baseline differences with higher SAPS and SOFA scores in the restrictive group\nPatients recruited despite having Hb >9. In the liberal group only 61% of patients received a blood transfusion.\u00a0Any differences reported for patients who had Hb >9 throughout the trial would have not been due to the difference in transfusion thresholds.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis single centre randomised controlled trial reported that in oncological patients with\u00a0septic shock a restrictive vs. liberal transfusion threshold resulted in no significant difference in 28 day mortality.\nThe study reported that one of their secondary outcomes, 90 day mortality, was significantly reduced at 90 days. I would be cautious about putting too much emphasis on this result as the fragility index was 0; there were no differences in 28 and 60 day mortality as well as a number of other secondary outcomes, and with there being only 1 unit difference in median units of RBC transfused between the two treatment groups, I would be surprised if this caused a 11% difference in mortality. Larger studies would be needed to confirm or refute this finding.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Liberal Versus Restrictive Transfusion Strategy in Critically Ill Oncologic Patients: The Transfusion Requirements in Critically Ill Oncologic Patients Randomized Controlled Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0TBL reviews of transfusion papers\n[further reading]\u00a0Restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategy for red blood cell transfusion: systematic review of randomised trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis\n[further reading]\u00a0Transfusion requirements in surgical oncology patients: a prospective, randomized controlled trial\n[further reading] Red blood cell transfusion in the resuscitation of septic patients with hematological malignancies\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date:\u00a05th June 2017\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@avkwong\n\n\n"
