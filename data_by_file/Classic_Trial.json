NEJM 2022; DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2202707\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients in ICU with septic shock, does a restrictive approach to fluid therapy compared to a standard care result in fewer deaths at day 90?\n\nBackground\n\nFluid therapy in the critically unwell has been widely studied across many patient populations\nHigher volumes of fluid in patients with sepsis and septic shock has been associated with harm, although a meta-analysis showed that the quality of evidence was very low\nThe ANDROMEDA SHOCK trial demonstrated in those with septic shock, that by 2 hours only ~25% of patients were deemed to still be fluid responsive\nThe CLASSIC pilot study showed that a restrictive fluid strategy was feasible and showed significantly less fluid was used in the first 5 ICU days in the restrictive group\n\nMortality at day 90 was an exploratory outcome and this was reduced in the restrictive group, although not significantly\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nStratified, parallel-group, open-label, international, randomised controlled trial\nRandomised 1:1 using a central web based system\n\nBlock sizes of 6 or 8\nStratified according to site and presence/absence of metastatic or haematological malignancy\n\n\nTreatment group assignments not masked for clinicians, patients or investigators\n\nThose on data safety monitoring committee, statisticians assessing the outcomes, and the management committee writing the abstract draft were blinded\n\n\nReceived assigned intervention from randomisation until ICU discharge (for a maximum of 90 days)\n\nIf re-admitted within 90 days then treatment assignment continued\n\n\nData collected from medical records and registries\n\nPatients or relatives contacted if further information needed\n\n\nPre-specified subgroups included need for respiratory support, AKI, Lactate > 4 mmol/L, weight > 76kg, > 30mls/kg of fluids administered in 24 hours prior to randomisation\nPower calculation\n\n1554 patients needed to show a 7% absolute reduction in 90 day mortality from a baseline of 45%\nType I and II error rates of 5% and 20% respectively\nBased on pilot study, prior RCTs and systematic reviews\n\n\nRegistered with clinicaltrials.gov\n\nSetting\n\n31 ICUs in Europe\nNovember 2018 to November 2021\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAge \u2265 18\nSeptic Shock according to Sepsis-3\n\nSuspected or confirmed infection, plasma lactate > 2mmol/L and vasopressor requirement\n\n\n1L of fluid administered in the prior 24 hours\nWithin 12 hours of screening\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nSeptic shock > 12 hours\nLife threatening bleeding\nBurns > 10% TBSA\nKnown Pregnancy\n\n\n2223 screened \u2013> 1554 randomised\n\n770 to restrictive group\n784 to standard group\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of restrictive vs. standard group\n\nAge (yrs): 71 vs 70\nMale (%): 59.9 vs 58.2\nMedian time from ICU admission to randomisation (hrs): 3 vs 3\nMedian predicted mortality (%): 40 vs 40\nSource of admission (%)\n\nED: 39.3 vs 38.5\nWards: 34.2 vs 38.7\n\n\nSource of infection (%):\n\nGI: 36.8 vs 38.3\nRespiratory: 27.7 vs 26.5\nUrinary: 15.8 vs 17.1\n\n\nMedian highest lactate (mmol/L): 3.8 vs 3.9\nMedian highest dose of noradrenaline (\u03bcg/kg/min): 0.25 vs 0.23\nMedian volume of IV fluids in prior 24 hours (L): 3.2 vs 3.0\nSystemic glucocorticoid use (%): 28.6 vs 29.1\nUse of respiratory support (NIV, IMV): 52.6 vs 48.6\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nRestrictive Group\nFluids could be given for:\n\nSevere hypoperfusion:\n\nLactate > 4 mmol/L\nMAP < 50 mmHg (with or without vasopressors/inotrope)\nMottling beyond kneecap\nUrine Output < 0.1ml/kg (only within first 2 hours post randomisation)\nIf met any of these criteria then 250-500mls bolus of crystalloid could be given followed by re-evaluation\n\n\nOvert losses (e.g. D+V) but only to correct for loss and not more\nIf oral or enteral route contraindicated for water or electrolyte solutions then IV fluids could be given to correct electrolyte derangements and to ensure a 1L/24hrs total intake\n\nFluids with medications and nutrition count as input\nFluids for medications should be reduced to lowest possible volume\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard Care\n\nNo upper limit for use of fluids\nIV fluids should be given based on SSC guidelines in case of circulatory impairment\nIV fluids should be given to replace observed or expected losses to correct dehydration or electrolyte derangements\nIV fluids should be given as maintenance in places with protocols that recommend this\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nIsotonic crystalloids used\n\nAlbumin only allowed following abdominal paracentesis\n\n\nConcomitant interventions for septic shock detailed in trial protocol (appropriate antibiotics, noradrenaline as a vasopressor, source control and RRT for routine indications)\nAll other treatment including diuretic use at discretion of treating clinicians\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\nDeath by day 90\n\nRestrictive 42.3% vs Standard 42.1%\nAdjusted absolute difference 0.1 (95% CI -4.7 to 4.9), p = 0.96\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nNumber of Serious Adverse Events\nNumber of days alive without life support\nNumber of days alive and out of the hospital\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn adult ICU patients with septic shock, IV fluid restriction did not result in fewer deaths at 90 days compared to standard IV fluid therapy\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised\nMulti-centre trial involving 31 ICUs across 8 European countries increases external validity\nPre-published statistical analysis plan\nIntention to treat analysis\nMinimal loss to follow up (0.6%)\nBalanced baseline characteristics\nUnwell patient cohort\nAchieved a separation in fluids administered via trial protocol\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnblinded\nThe most common infection source was GI \u2013 this may have necessitated large volumes of replacement fluid if diarrhoea or vomiting were prominent features\nPowered for a 7% reduction in mortality\nLarge volumes of fluid given outside of the trial protocol\n\nNearly 3L of fluid given to each group in 24 hours prior to randomisation\nThe total difference in fluids administered by day 5 was only ~2L (8.8L vs 10.8L), with a difference of only ~800mls in the cumulative day 5 fluid balance\nThese similarities between the groups may result if the standard care delivered in ICUs is already a relatively restrictive (e.g. no maintenance) fluid strategy\n\n\u00a0This potentially biases the results towards the null\n\n\n\n\nLarge numbers of protocol violations (% patients with at least one violation)\n\n21.5% in restrictive group vs 13.0% in standard group\n\nIn restrictive group 64% of violations were for fluid bolus use without criteria being met\n\nViolations resulted in median of 97ml fluid administered/day\n\n\nIn standard group 100% of violations were for no IV fluid being given on any single day in ICU\n\nThis was 13% of all patients in the standard group\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there was no difference in outcome when violations removed in per-protocol analysis\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study did not confirm my pre-existing biases, in that a restrictive fluid strategy was not shown to be superior, with respect to 90 day mortality, to standard fluid management currently being practiced in European ICUs\n\u00a0However, the 5 day cumulative fluid balance in the standard group was not much greater than the restrictive group. Therefore care is still required to ensure that every patient in ICU has a vigilant and considered fluid management strategy. This includes the de-escalation or evacuation phase of fluid therapy.\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Restriction of Intravenous Fluids in ICU patients with Septic Shock\nfurther reading editorial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker @hgmwalker\nSummary date: 17th June 2022\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\nPicture by: Pixabay/Pexels\n\n\n"
