Cureus 11(4): e4456. DOI 10.7759/cureus.4456\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) in cardiac arrest, does a standardised point-of-care ultrasound protocol, compared with usual care, affect the length of resuscitation, frequency of interventions, and clinical outcomes?\n\nBackground\n\nThe use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been increasing across acute medical specialties with the development of several POCUS protocols e.g. RUSH\nDespite this, studies have shown mixed outcomes with regards to improving\u00a0 patient outcomes\n\nSHoC-ED trial showed no benefit in mortality in patients with undifferentiated shock treated using standardised POCUS protocol compared to usual care\nRetrospective analysis of MIMIC-III database showed that the use of transthoracic echocardiography in critically ill patients was associated with an improved 28-day mortality\n\n\nSpecifically in patients in cardiac arrest, the use of POCUS has the ability of diagnosing aetiology and hence, guide subsequent care, but this needs to be balanced against the risk of interruption to basic life support (rebelEM blog)\n\nDesign\n\nSingle centre\nNon-randomised, unblinded\nRetrospective analysis of healthcare records using structured chart review\nScans performed by competent personnel\nTo provide 80% power to detect a 5% difference from a baseline population survival to hospital discharge rate at alpha 0.05, sample size of 185 required\n\nassuming baseline discharge rate of 5%\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nTertiary healthcare centre in Canada\n2010 to 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAge 19 or over\nCardiac arrest at presentation to emergency department\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nResuscitation halted due to end-of-life decisions\nCardiac arrest as inpatient\n\n\n223 patients met inclusion criteria (180 had POCUS assessment; 21 had visualised cardiac activity, 159 did not)\nSimilar baseline characteristics including rates of witnessed arrest and bystander CPR\n\nIntervention\n\nPOCUS assessment during Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS)\n\nFurther sub-divided based on visualised cardiac activity or standstill during initial POCUS examination\nImages acquired using standard POCUS techniques using curvilinear or phased array probes by competent sonographers\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNo POCUS during ACLS\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nResuscitation based ACLS protocols\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Pts in the POCUS groups received longer mean duration of resuscitation and higher intervention rates compared to pts without POCUS\n\nLength of resuscitation\n\nPOCUS cardiac activity: 27.3 mins (95% CI 17.7 \u2013 37.0 mins)\nPOCUS standstill: 11.51 mins (95% CI 10.2 \u2013 12.8 mins)\nControl: 14.36 mins (95% CI 9.89 \u2013 18.8 mins)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nPts in POCUS group had significantly higher rates of ROSC and survival to hospital admission compared to pts without POCUS\nThere was no difference in rate of survival to hospital discharge\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nPatients with cardiac activity on PoCUS received increased resuscitative effort and had improved clinical outcomes as compared to those with negative findings or when no PoCUS was performed.\n\nStrengths\n\nAll cardiac arrests were included for analysis\nPOCUS protocol used consistent with international practice\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRetrospective analysis (non-randomised, unblinded, single centre)\nPower calculation based on secondary outcome\n\n\u201csmall difference of 5%\u201d but unclear if absolute or relative. If absolute, investigators estimated that POCUS would lead to zero deaths! If relative, they are looking for an absolute difference of 0.25%, this would require a sample size of 116231 for two cohorts, and binomial categorical outcomes of 5% and 4.75% with alpha 0.05 and beta 80%\n\n\n80% of patients had POCUS assessment \u2013 unclear if cohorts had been matched to even out covariates\nActual delays in CPR not recorded\nPerformed by competent personnel \u2013 what does this mean?\nQuality and accuracy of POCUS examination not assessed\nQuality of life indicators not assessed in survivors\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe fact that pts with cardiac activity visualised on POCUS received longer resuscitation attempts, more interventions and had a higher rate of ROSC is unsurprising\n\nThe reverse is also unsurprising as the decision to terminate or stop intervention is a self-fulfilling prophecy\n\n\nDespite higher rates of ROSC in pts with cardiac activity on POCUS, the rate of survival to hospital discharge falls to that of pts who received no POCUS\nI will continue to use POCUS during the management of cardiac arrest but priority remains good quality chest compressions and resuscitation\nFurther testing by prospective trial as this study is a) hypothesis generating b) has biological plausibility and c) health economics and d) safety relevance\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Atkinson et al.
