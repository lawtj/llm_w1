This may be due to their anti-inflammatory affects\nInterleukin-6 is released in response to infection and stimulates inflammatory pathways as part of the acute phase response\nTocilizumab and sarilumab are monoclonal antibodies that inhibit the IL-6 receptor\nRandomised controlled trials to date have predominately shown no benefit from IL-6 antagonists, although the majority of patients included in these trials have not been critically unwell\n\nBACC (n=243, 5% non-invasive ventilation[NIV]/high-flow-nasal-cannula[HFNC]/mechanical ventilation[MV] at baseline) \u2013 no significant difference\nCORIMUNO-TOCI-1 (n=130, 0% NIV/HFNC/MV at basline) \u2013 no significant difference\nRCT-TCZ-COVID-19 (n=126, P/F ratio of 200-300, allowed HFNC at baseline but not mechanical ventilation) \u2013 no significant difference\nEMPACTA (n=389, 0% receiving NIV/MV) \u2013 patients who required ventilation or died within 28 days \u2013 significantly lower in tocilzumab group\nCOVACTA (n=452, 67% receiving NIV/MV/ECMO at baseline) \u2013 no significant difference\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nMultifactorial adaptive platform trial (part of the REMAP-CAP trial)\nOpen-label\nBlinded international trial steering committee\nUnblinded independent data and safety monitoring board\nRandomised via centralised computer programme\nStarted with balanced assignment for each intervention and control (e.g. 1:1 if two interventions available, 1:1:1 if three interventions available)\nImmune modulation domain\n\nInvestigators at each site selected a priori at least 2 of the 5 interventions, one of which had to be standard of care, to which patients would be randomised\n\nIL-6 receptor antagonists\n\ntocilizumab\nsarilumab\n\n\nIL-1 receptor antagonist\n\nanakira\n\n\nInterferon beta 1a\nStandard of care (no immune modulation)\n\n\nThis paper reports the outcomes of the IL-6 receptor antagonist compared with standard of care\nInitially only tocilizumab was available\n\n\nParticipants could be randomised to other interventions within other domains including antibiotics, plasma, dosing of anticoagulation prophylaxis\nBayesian design with no maximum sample size\nRegular interim analyses, potentially with response-adaptive randomisation\nPrimary analysis conducted on all severe state patients with COVID-19 randomised to any domain\nAnalysis of primary outcome was repeated using only data from patients enrolled in domains that had stopped and were unblinded at the time of analysis with no adjustment for assignment in other ongoing domains\nPre-defined statistical triggers for trial conclusion\nMultiple funders including Roche Products Ltd and Sanofi \u2013 they had no role in trial design, analysing data or publication\nPrimary outcome was a composite ordinal outcome combining respiratory and cardiovascular support free days up to day 21. Patients who died within this time frame are assigned the worst outcome (-1). 1.5 days was considered a minimally important difference\n\nSetting\n\n113 sites across 6 countries, predominately in the UK\nData collected from 19/04/20\u00a0 \u2013 19/11/20\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nCritically ill adult patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19\nAdmitted to an intensive care unit\nReceiving respiratory or cardiovascular organ support\n\nRespiratory organ support defined as mechanical ventilation or non-invasive mechanical ventilation including via high flow nasal cannula if flow rate >30l/min and FiO2 >0.4\nCardiovascular support defined as IV infusion of any vasopressor or inotrope\n\n\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nFor overall REMAP-CAP trial\n\nPresumption that death was imminent; prior participation in REMAP-CAP within 90 days; >14 days while admitted to hospital with illness suspected or proved to pandemic infection\n\n\nAdditional exclusion criteria specific to IL-6 domain\n\n>24 hours since ICU admission\nCondition or treatment resulting in ongoing immunosuppression including neutropenia\nKnown or suspected pregnancy\nALT/AST >5 times upper limit of normal\nPlatelet <50\n\n\n\n\n2046 patients randomised in at least 1 domain in the severe disease state of REMAP-CAP, 895 patients randomised in the Immune Modulation domain (366 to tocilizumab, 48 to sarilumab, 412 to control, 69 to other interventions);

With greater numbers of patients included in the trial we can have greater confidence in the results\nTrial sponsors had no involvement in design, writing or publication of the paper\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOpen label\nTo date only short term outcomes known, and a number of patients remain in hospital\nNot all patients received drug allocated\nNearly 5% of patients randomised lost to follow up/withdrew consent\nLow numbers of patients received Sarilumab\nLow fragility index\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe REMAP-CAP adaptive platform, open-label randomised controlled trial reported significantly greater organ support free days to day 21 with the use of the IL-6 receptor antagonists (tocilizumab or Sarilumab), compared with standard care\nBoth hospital and 90 day mortality were also significantly reduced with the use of IL-6 receptor antagonists\nFour out of the five previous studies investigating the use of IL-6 antagonists for COVID-19 reported no significant differences. However, the majority of patients included in previous trials were not critically ill\nIn light of the conflicting results and the low fragility index, further studies would be welcome, particularly in critically ill patients, to confirm the findings from this REMAP-CAP study. In the mean time, in patients not randomised to a trial, I will be prescribing IL-6 antagonists to critically ill patients with COVID-19 who meet the inclusion & exclusion criteria of this trial\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Interleukin-6 Receptor Antagonists in Critically Ill Patients with Covid-19 \u2013 Preliminary report\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 09/01/21\nPeer-review editor: Charlotte Summers\nPicture by: Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
