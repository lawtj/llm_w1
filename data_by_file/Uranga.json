p<0.001\nHospital readmission by day 30 was more common in the control group: 9 (6.6%) vs 2 (1.4%); p=0.02\nNo statistically significant difference in other secondary outcomes:\n\nhospital mortality\nmortality at day 30\ntime until clinical improvement\ntime to return to normal clinical activity\nradiographic resolution at day 30\nadverse antibiotic effects\ncomplications during hospitalisation\nlength of hospital stay\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nShorter duration of antibiotic therapy, consistent with the recommendations of the IDSA/ ATS, can be safely implemented in hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, leading to a significant reduction in treatment duration\n\nStrengths\n\nMulticentre randomised controlled trial answering an important clinical question in a frequently observed disease\nPragmatic study design, allowing physicians to select their preferred antibiotic for the first five days of therapy\nThe study participants had similar baseline characteristics and were well-matched\nThere was a significant difference in antibiotic duration between the study groups\nBoth intention to treat and per-protocol analyses were performed.\nAlthough ICU patients were excluded, around 40% of patients in both study arms had pneumonia severity index scores of IV-V, indicative of severe illness\nThe primary outcome incorporated both clinical success using objective criteria and also patient-reported outcomes\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe authors initially planned to have all-cause mortality or major complications as the primary outcome measure but when it was apparent that these were infrequent, they moved to surrogate outcome measures\n80% of the patients in the study received quinolones, with fewer than 10% receiving a beta-lactam/macrolide combination\nThe study was performed in the Basque Country in Spain, limiting generalisability to the UK population, where beta-lactam antibiotics are generally first-line\nLack of blinding may have influenced physician decisions in the control arm. A study design incorporating a placebo with double blinding may have minimised this\nClinical criteria for stopping antibiotics applied to 70.1% of patients in the experimental arm, meaning that almost one third of patients did not receive the assigned intervention in a non-inferiority study. It was unclear whether these patients continued antibiotics due to clinical reasons or because of physician preference\nThis was a highly selected group of patients and multiple exclusion criteria were incorporated, including prior antibiotic therapy\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nStopping antibiotics at day five appears to be a safe strategy in stable patients who are hospitalised with mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia in Northern Spain.\nThese results cannot be generalised to the UK population, mainly due to significant differences in prescribing practices between these countries.\nThe use of clinical criteria for stopping antibiotics may be a better strategy than an arbitrary length of treatment. Further studies in this area may help in ensuring appropriate antibiotic stewardship in the future.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Duration of Antibiotic Treatment in Community-Acquired Pneumonia\nA Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Fraser Magee\nSummary date: 19th Jan 2017\nPeer-review editor: Steve Mathieu\n\n\n"
