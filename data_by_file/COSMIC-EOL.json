Published Online; doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02176-0\nClinical Question\n\nIn relatives of patients dying in the ICU, does a 3 step support strategy compared with standard care reduce prolonged grief disorder?\n\nBackground\n\nRelatives of patients admitted to the intensive care are often affected by symptoms such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder\nRelatives of patients who die in the ICU are at risk of suffering from prolonged grief that can be distressing and disabling and is associated with increased consumption of health-care resources\nStudies have demonstrated that communication with ICU clinicians has a major effect on relatives\u2019 experiences\nThis study aimed to investigate whether a communication strategy could reduce prolonged grief\n\nDesign\n\nCluster randomised controlled trial\nParticipating ICU\u2019s randomly assigned into an intervention cluster and a control cluster\nCentral randomisation using permuted blocks of non-released size\nStratified based on the recruitment period and whether the centre had previously participated in a study from the author\u2019s research group\nIntention to treat analysis\nRegistered with clinicaltrials.gov\nStudy was conducted prior to COVID-19 and was therefore unaffected by restricted visiting\nTreating centres were not blinded\nOutcomes assessed by trained psychologists during telephone follow up at 1, 3 and 6 months\nOutcome assessors blinded to group assignment\nProlonged grief defined as score of \u226530 on the prolonged grief-13 questionnaire (PG-13) 6 months after the death\n454 relatives needed to obtain 90% power to decrease the primary outcome from 50% to 35% with a type 1 error of 5%. Between-cluster variation was accounted for using an inflation factor leading to a resulting sample size of 704. To allow for a 25% drop off, planned to enrol 874 relatives\n\nSetting\n\n34 intensive care units France\nPatients enrolled from 2017 \u2013 2019\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nRelatives of patients

strategy significantly reduced prolonged grief symptoms\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre\nRandomised\nBlinding of outcome assessors\n6 month follow up\nIntention to treat analysis\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\nCluster randomised trials are well suited when an approach to patient care is being tested (as opposed to a physiological or pharmacological intervention)\n\nIt reduces the risk of contamination where aspects of the intervention may be adopted in caring for patients in the control group which would dilute the observed differences\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOnly conducted in France which limits external validity as communication styles and risk of prolonged grief may be different in different populations\nIn the intensive care unit I work in it is standard practice to have an end of life family conference where as this only occurred in 67% in the control group. It is unknown how much impact the end of life family conference had on prolonged grief compared with some of the other interventions utilised in this 3 step support strategy\nRates of prolonged grief in trial centres prior to study period was not known. We therefore do not know if there were any baseline differences between the intervention and the control centres\nPG-13 score has not been validated in ICU, there is no established minimally important clinical difference in score\nOnly 79% completed follow up at 6 months. However sample size based on 25% drop out\nThe application of these results to linguistically diverse patients and relatives is not clear\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCommunication skills have a vital importance in reducing the risk of prolonged grief in relatives of patients who died in the ICU\nIn intensive care units in France, this 3 stage support strategy, compared with standard care, significantly reduced prolonged grief as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder\nAll intensive care units should review their communication styles and skills to determine what improvements can be made\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0A three-step support strategy for relatives of patients dying in the intensive care unit: a cluster randomised trial\n[further reading] End-of-Life Care in the Intensive Care Unit Can We Simultaneously Increase Quality and Reduce Costs?\n[further reading] Dying with Dignity in the Intensive Care Unit\n[further reading] Nurse-Led Communication in the Intensive Care Unit\n[further reading] How Do I Humanise Patient Care\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 28/02/2022\nPeer-review editor: @celiabradford\nImage by: Tomislav Jakupec from Pixabay\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
