JAMA 2021:325(6):552-560 doi:10.1001/jama.2021.0135\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with acute myocardial infarction and anaemia is a restrictive, compared with a liberal transfusion strategy, non-inferior with respect to major adverse cardiovascular outcomes at 30 days?\n\nBackground\n\nAnaemia is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome\nIt is not known if transfusing patients with anaemia and AMI ameliorates this risk and often patients with acute coronary syndromes are excluded from trials comparing liberal and restrictive transfusion strategies\nPrevious trials have been very small with poor methodology\nThere is wide variation in practice\nThere is a growing body of evidence demonstrating harm from transfusion in several patient groups\nTRICS-III, a trial in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with moderate-to-high risk of death showed a restrictive strategy of transfusion was non-inferior to a liberal strategy with respect to a composite outcome\nThe\u00a0TRISS\u00a0trial investigated liberal versus restrictive transfusion in patients with septic shock and demonstrated no significant difference in 90 day mortality\nPatients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding had lower mortality with a restrictive strategy (Villanueva, NEJM 2013;368(1)11-21)\nThe\u00a0TRICC\u00a0trial assessed a liberal versus restrictive strategy in 838 ICU patients expected to stay >24 hours and showed no mortality difference. However, patients who were admitted after cardiac surgery were excluded from this study\nTransfusion may cause platelet activation and increase thrombotic risk by causing platelet activation, aggregation and vasoconstriction\nA storage defect in blood causing depletion in nitric oxide and 2,3 DPG may mean that the desired effect of improving O2 delivery may not be achieved with transfused blood\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n1:1 randomisation to liberal or restrictive transfusion\nAllocation concealment achieved by a web-based randomisation method with block randomisation and variable size blocks, stratified by centre\nInitially the design had the restrictive group being transfused if Hb<7g/dL but this was changed to Hb<8g/dL to improve investigator adherence to the protocol\nThe patient could be randomised at any time from admission up to 30 days into their hospital stay\nPatients consented to involvement in the trial prior to randomisation\nUnblinded, although the outcomes were objective\nThe outcome was a composite MACE (major acute cardiovascular event) at 30 days. The outcomes of interest were all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction, emergency revascularisation prompted by ischaemia, stroke.\nThe analysis was as-randomised and as-treated (in non-inferiority trials this is done instead of intention to treat analysis)\nThe power calculation was based on observational data from the French registry of AMI which demonstrated MACE at 30 days to be 11% in a restrictive transfusion group and 15% in a liberal transfusion group\n630 patients were deemed necessary to achieve an 80% power to demonstrate non-inferiority in the restrictive group (assuming 5% would have protocol variation)\n\nSetting\n\nFrance (26 centres) and Spain (9 centres)\nEnrolment occurred between March 2016 to September 2019\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: AMI (with or without ST elevation, symptoms in the last 48 hours and elevated biomarkers of myocardial injury) AND Haemoglobin between 7 and 10 g/dL during the admission. Age > 18 years\nExclusion:\n\nShock (SBP <90mmHg) with clinical signs of low cardiac output\nAMI after CAGs or PCI\nLife-threatening bleeding\nBlood transfusion in last 30 days\nMalignant haematologic disease\n\n\nParticipant numbers:\u00a0668 patients were randomised\nBaseline characteristics: patients were well-matched at baseline\n\nThe median age was 77 years\n57.8% were male\n70% had NSTEMI, 30% had STEMI\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nLiberal transfusion (n=324)\n\ntransfusion for all patients with Hb < 10g/dL with a target post-transfusion Hb > 11g/d\n\n\n\nControl\n\nRestrictive transfusion (n=342)\n\ntransfusion if Hb < 8g/dL with a target 8-10g/dL. Originally the threshold was 7g/dL but was changed to maximise investigator adherence to the protocol, before the first patient was included\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nLeukodepleted red cells were used\nTransfusion could be administered at any time if there was a suspected massive bleeding event, before waiting for a haemoglobin result\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: 30 day MACE (a composite score of major adverse cardiovascular events \u2013 all-cause death, stroke, recurrent MI, emergency revascularisation prompted by ischaemia)\n\nAt day 30, MACE had occurred in 14% in liberal group and 11% in restrictive group (45 vs 36 patients, between group difference -3% 95% CI -8.4% to 2.4%). This met the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion\nPrimary outcome analysis was of the as-treated population\nAs-randomised population had very similar results\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: The components of the Day 30 MACE were reported as secondary outcomes. Due to high risk of Type 1 error, no formal statistical comparisons are made\nComparing Liberal Transfusion vs. Restrictive Transfusion\n\nDeath 25 vs 19 people (7.7% vs 5.6%)\nNonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction 10 vs 7 people (3.1% vs 2.1%)\nEmergency revascularisation 6 vs 5 people (1.9% vs 1.5%)\nNon-fatal ischemic stroke 2 vs 2 (0.6% vs 0.6%)\n\n\nPatients who received >=1 unit blood transfusion \n\ngreater in liberal group (99.7% vs 35.7%)\n\n\n Evidence of Harm: patients in the liberal group were more likely to\n\nhave acute lung injury\n\n7 vs 1 people (2.2% vs 0.3%)\n\n\ndevelop infection (documented bacteremia or bacterial infection)\n\n5 vs 0 (1.5% vs 0%)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with AMI and anaemia, a restrictive transfusion strategy compared with a liberal transfusion strategy was non-inferior in regards to 30 day MACE outcomes\n\nStrengths\n\nAn important study in a key population where a paucity of evidence exists\nClinically important outcomes\nPatients were analysed as randomised AND as treated\nFollow-up was near complete (2 patients withdrew consent)\nAllocation concealment\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPhysicians were unblinded to the therapy but the outcome measures were objective so bias to outcome likely low\nThe margin for non-inferiority was 25% so although this pre-specified margin was reached, this trial does not completely eliminate that a restrictive strategy is non-inferior. This minimal clinically important difference is arbitrarily agreed to in non-inferiority trials\nStatistical significance for superiority was not met so a larger trial would need to be conducted to demonstrate superiority. This trial could be used to estimate sample size in a future larger trial\nOutcome was assessed at Day 30. This is relatively short and could miss key events. A longer period for follow-up would add to the validity\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAlthough not definitive this trial suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy in patients with AMI and anaemia is safe with a non-statistically significant trend towards superiority\nA larger trial would be needed to definitely guide management of anaemia in this patient population\n\nExternal Links\n\nThe REALITY trial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:Celia Bradford @celiabradford\nSummary date: 25/1/21\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\nPicture by: [author/site]\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
