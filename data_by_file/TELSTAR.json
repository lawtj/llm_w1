DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2115998\nClinical Question\n\nIn comatose survivors of cardiac arrest does the treatment of rhythmic and periodic electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns improve neurological outcome compared with standard care?\n\nBackground\n\nCardiac arrest, occurring both in and out-of-hospital, is associated with high mortality and morbidity\nEven with the absence of clinically apparent seizures, abnormal EEG findings\u00a0 such as both rhythmic and periodic discharges, occur in 10-35% of these patients\nThese abnormal EEG findings are a poor prognostic sign and associated with worse outcomes\nThere is variation in treatment practices amongst neurologists and it is not known whether pharmacological suppression of this abnormal EEG activity improves outcome\n\nDesign\n\n1:1 ratio\nPermuted blocks of variable size\nMulti-centre, open-label treatment\nBlinded outcome assessors\nWritten informed consent from next of kin\nAn independent safety monitoring board analysed the safety and efficacy of the study at key points throughout the trial to advise if it could continue\nPower calculations required 84 patients in each arm to detect superiority\n\nThis was based on a 7% reduction in poor outcome (from 99 \u2013 92%) with anti-seizure treatment, an alpha of 5% and a power of 80%\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n11 ICUs in Belgium and The Netherlands\nMay 1 2014 \u2013 January 24 2021, with 3-month follow-up\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n>18 years\nComatose survivors of cardiac arrest (in OR out-of-hospital)\nROSC\nHad continuous EEG monitoring initiated <24 hours after the arrest\nMinimum duration of rhythmic or periodic EEG pattern was for >30 consecutive minutes or lasting >5 minutes at least twice in a 60-minute period\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nPre-hospital GOS <3\nOther cause of status epilepticus or progressive brain illness (neurodegenerative disease or brain tumour)\nLife-sustaining therapy not deemed appropriate\nConsent not possible\n\n\n354 patients were found to have rhythmic or periodic EEG pattern.\n\n175 were excluded and 179 included for randomisation\n88 allocated to the intervention group and 84 to the control group\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nGroups were generally similar at baseline except rates of initial shockable rhythm\n\nMedian age: 65\nMale: 69%\n95% were out of hospital arrest, 5% in hospital\nPresumed to be a cardiac cause of the arrest: 80% v 77%\nTime to commencement of BLS: 5 vs 5 minutes\nTime to ROSC: 16 vs 19 minutes\nHigher rates of shockable rhythm as first monitored rhythm in control group: 60% vs 72%\nAll patients received targeted temperature management:\n\n24% vs 24% targeted at 33C\n76% vs 76% targeted 33-36C\n\n\nMyoclonus at randomisation: 61% vs 64%\nEEG patterns at randomisation:\n\nGeneralised periodic discharges (0.5 \u2013 2.5Hz): 77% vs 81%\nElectrographic seizures (>2.5Hz): 10 vs 10%\nSuppressed background continuity: 15% vs 17%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n3-staged antiseizure treatment: titrated to EEG\n\nStep 1: antiepileptic drug + benzodiazepine\n\nPhenytoin load (15-20 mg/kg), then regular phenytoin titrated to serum level + benzodiazepine bolus + infusion. If phenytoin contraindicated, levetiracetam or valproate were used for step 1\n\n\nStep 2: anaesthetic agent + second antiepileptic drug\n\nPropofol infusion (8mg/kg/hr) + levetiracetam (1500mg load + 1g bd maintenance) OR valproate (10-20 mg/kg load + 7.5mg/kg bd maintenance)\n\n\nStep 3: second anaesthetic agent\n\nThiopental: first six hours 12.5 mg/kg/hr iv, next six hours 5 mg/kg/hr iv\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of the antiseizure therapy was to suppress all rhythmic and periodic EEG activity for at least 48 consecutive hours (>90% suppression)\nTreatment started within 3 hours of detection of rhythmic and periodic EEG patterns\nTreatment guided by neurologist or clinical neurophysiologist who adjusted medications in consultation with ICU physician\n\nEEG recordings checked every 3 hours\n\n\nIf the abnormal EEG patterns were observed beyond 48 hours, the treatments could be continued beyond this point if the physician preferred\n\nControl\n\nPhysician preference: sedative agents could be prescribed if there was ventilator dyssynchrony or myoclonus\nUse of antiepileptic agents discouraged although 8 patients in this group did receive at least 1 antiepileptic agent\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAt the discretion of the treating team\nTargeted temperature management similar in both groups\nLimitations and withdrawal of active therapies were based on Dutch Guidelines and were not determined by the presence or absence of abnormal EEG patterns\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Neurologic outcome according to the Cerebral Performance Category scale at 3 months dichotomized to good outcome (CPC 1-2) or poor outcome (CPC 3-5) [comparing intervention vs control]:\n\nNo difference in CPC 3-5: 90% vs 92% (p=0.68)\n\nRisk difference 2% (95% confidence interval -7 to 11)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes [comparing intervention vs control]:\n\nDeath: no difference 80% vs 82%\n\nHowever, within 24 hours of randomisation, 9% patients in the antiseizure group had died compared with 24% in the control group with withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies occurring in 2% of the antiseizure group compared with 13% in the control group\n\n\nMean LOS in ICU: longer in intervention group\n\n8.7 vs 7.5 days\n\n\nMean duration of mechanical ventilation: longer in intervention group\n\n7.8 vs 6.6 days\n\n\n\n\nPer protocol analysis: similar results\nSubgroup Analyses:\u00a0no significant difference in any pre-specified subgroup (type of EEG activity, background EEG activity, onset of activity post cardiac arrest)\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn comatose patients after cardiac arrest with rhythmic and periodic EEG activity, intensive antiseizure treatment over a period of at least 48 hours did not improve neurologic outcomes at 3 months\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised\nAllocation concealment\nVariable block sizes\nBlinding of assessors\nComplete follow-up\nIntention to treat analysis\nAn important clinical question with clinically meaningful outcome measures which also takes into account utilisation of ICU resources\n\nWeaknesses\n\n8 patients in control group received antiepileptic drugs, however, the per protocol analysis yielded similar results\nThe small sample size has resulted in a wide confidence interval for the primary outcome and therefore a modest benefit or harm is not ruled out\nThe unblinded nature of the study may have impacted end of life decision making. Certainly, patients in the control group were more likely to have therapies withdrawn at an earlier stage compared with the intervention group\nThe EEG readers were aware of the trial-group assignments\nContinuous EEG monitoring is not routine practice in a lot of ICUs. However, this trial suggests that treating the abnormal patterns seen does not help patient outcomes. This trial does not support a role for routine cEEG.\nThe CPC scale may have some inter-rater variability with one study suggesting 22% discordance between scores on the five point scale and 10% discordance in dichotomised scoring\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTreating rhythmic and periodic EEG patterns with intensive antiseizure therapies in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest does not improve mortality and likely prolongs the intensity of therapies without benefit to neurological recovery\nI would not advocate to treat abnormal EEG findings with antiseizure therapies in this patient group\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Treating Rhythmic and Periodic EEG Patterns in Comatose Survivors of Cardiac Arrest\n[editorial] Futility of Suppressing Seizure-like Activity in Postresuscitation Coma\n[further reading] Introduction to interpretation of the EEG in intensive care\n[further reading] Inter-rater reliability of post-arrest CPC scores\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @celiabradford\nSummary date: 5th March 2022\nPeer-review editor: George Walker\nPicture by: iStock\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
