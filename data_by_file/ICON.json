Critical Care 2018; 22:310.\u00a0doi.org/10.1186/s13054-018-2223-6\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill adults that survive their acute illness, what is the incidence of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder?\n\nBackground\n\nIntensive care interventions aim to increase survival in those with critical illness, but the psychopathological component has not been studied in great depth\nSurvivors of critical illness are thought to suffer anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in up to 46%, 29% and 34% of cases, respectively\nStudies to date have been small or in specific subsets of critically ill populations. This study aimed to be a large cohort study to describe the pattern of psychopathology after critical illness and assess any association with mortality\n\nDesign\n\nProspective, cohort, observational study\nMulti-centre, single country\nThree phases of recruitment:\n\nPhase 1 included postal surveys at 3, 12 and 24 months\nPhase 2 included postal surveys at 3, 12 and 24 months but was also a study-within-a-study RCT investigating survey burden and response rates\nPhase 3 included postal surveys at 3 and 12 months, and included an initial visit prior to discharge by a research nurse and a telephone follow-up if they did not respond to the postal survey\n\n\nSince a self-reporting survey was not considered diagnostic of a disease, the \u2018caseness\u2019 of each disease was assessed \u2013 this is the degree to which accepted diagnostic criteria are applicable to a given patient according to their survey answers\nPatients were matched to records within the UK\u2019s ICNARC Case Mix Programme database, to obtain diagnoses, severity of illness scores and admission details\nThe NHS Summary Care Record database and individual General Practitioners were consulted to identify patients who had died or would not be able to answer questionnaires\nSurvival status was obtained by matching patients to records held by the Office of National Statistics\n\nSetting\n\n39 UK institutions recruited patients with a mixture of university hospitals, university-affiliated hospitals and district general hospitals\n\n26 recruited during Phase 1 and 2\n31 recruited during Phase 3\n\nOf which 18 had also recruited for Phase 1 and 2\n\n\n\n\nRecruitment occurred from Nov 2006 to May 2013\n\nPhase 1 \u2013 Nov 2006 to May 2008\nPhase 2 \u2013 May 2008 to Oct 2010\nPhase 3 \u2013 May 2012 to May 2013\n\n\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: All patients who received at least 24 hours of \u201cLevel 3 Care\u201d in an Intensive Care Unit\nExclusion: Age under 16 years; not registered with a General Practitioner; taking part in another follow-up study; unable to match record in ICNARC database; withdrawal of consent\n21,633 patients were screened; 19,822 were eligible; 13,155 were sent the questionnaire after exclusion of those that had died or were withdrawn after consulting their GP\nDemographics of those that replied compared to all those sent a questionnaire were very similar (responders vs whole cohort)\n\nMedian age: 64 vs 63 years\nAPACHE 2 score: 15 vs 15\nMedian ICU Length of Stay: 3 vs 3 days\n\n\n\nObservation\n\nThe three psychopathologies considered were:\n\nAnxiety \u2013 The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)\nDepression \u2013 HADS\nPTSD \u2013 Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Check List \u2013 Civilian version (PCL-C)\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\n4,942 patients (38%) completed at least one survey\n\n2,943 patients (22%) actively declined by returning a blank survey form\n\n\nPrimary outcome: \u00a0Caseness at 3 months was similar to results at 12 months\n\nAnxiety: 45.7%\nDepression: 41.0%\nPTSD: 22.0%\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nCross-over of caseness: shown in the Venn Diagram below:\n\n55.2% of patients met thresholds for caseness of at least one of the three conditions\n35.8% of patients met thresholds for caseness of more than one condition\n\n\n\n\n\nVenn Diagram describing cross-over of caseness amongst responders (area represents proportion; green = PTSD, orange = Depression, blue = Anxiety)\n\n\n\nSurvival:\n\nCaseness for depression was associated with a higher likelihood of death within 2 years of discharge\n\nHazard Ratio: 1.47 (after adjustments for known confounders; 95% CI 1.19\u20131.80; P < 0.001)\n\n\nThis link was not found for anxiety or PTSD\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn those who respond to a postal survey after a critical illness, the incidence of psychopathology is more than 50%, and patients with depression are nearly 50% more likely to die during the first 2 years after discharge from an Intensive Care Unit compared to those without depression\n\nStrengths\n\nExtremely important, patient-centred study question\nLarge, multi-centre study\nUtilised large national datasets with excellent data quality to extrapolate covariates and outcomes\nHighly validated tools used to assess caseness of diseases\nAppropriate methodology, ethical approval, statistical methods and reporting framework\n\nWeaknesses\n\nCohort study has inherent biases and is less able to demonstrate causation than a randomised, controlled trial\n\nAn association was demonstrated between depression and 2-year survival, but this cannot be said to be causal\nKnown and unknown confounding factors cannot always be accounted for \u2013 for example, pre-morbid psychopathologies were not known but are likely to have effected the incidence after critical illness\n\n\nThe response rate was low, so there may be selection bias\n\nAre responders more or less likely to suffer psychopathologies compared to non-responders?\nWhat was the reason that 22% chose to actively not complete the survey, and how did they differ from those that did complete the survey?\n\n\nThe study-within-a-study RCT demonstrated that asking patients to complete questionnaires about depression, anxiety and PTSD leads them to report their quality of life as lower than those who were not asked to complete these questionnaires\n\nA bias that occurs as a result of taking the measurement itself is known as the Hawthorne Effect\n\n\nThree different phases may have led to changing biases over time\n\nHowever, the recruitment criteria and questionnaires did not change over time so this likely to be of negligible effect\n\n\nIncidence of a disease has to be inferred from the caseness acquired from a postal survey tool\n\nAn assessment by a qualified, skilled clinician may come to a different conclusion than a questionnaire implies\n\n\nThis result may not be extrapolatable\u00a0to populations beyond the United Kingdom\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAlthough these data have limitations, they form the best evidence available in this important area of patient care after critical illness\nClinicians should be aware of the high incidence of anxiety, depression and PTSD when considering patients for admission, life-prolonging invasive therapies, withdrawal of care or follow-up after critical illness\nFamilies and patients should be made aware of the psychological burden after critical illness and encouraged to seek help, although further research is required to identify therapies that are effective\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Anxiety, Depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after critical illness: a UK-wide prospective cohort study\n[further reading]\u00a0Blog by article author Dr Hatch\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Duncan Chambler\nSummary date: 10 April 2019\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\n\n\n"
