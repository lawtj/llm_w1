NEJM 2015; published online first (accessed 19th November 2015). doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1509139\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients that are in cardiac arrest, do uninterrupted chest compressions compared to chest compressions interrupted for manual ventilation improve survival, neurological recovery or the rate of adverse events?\n\nDesign\n\nCluster randomised, controlled, cross-over trial\n\nEmergency Medical Services (EMS) grouped into clusters\nRandomised to intervention or control as a cluster\nRun-in phase to demonstrate adherence and performance\nCross-over to alternative trial arm twice a year\n\n\nUnblinded EMS providers; outcome assessment blinding not specified\nHuber-White sandwich adjustment used to statistically account for cluster design (reduces risk of false positive conclusion)\nAdjustment made for interim analyses to reduce false positive risk\nDesigned to have 90% power to detect survival rates of 8.1% in the control group versus 9.4% in the intervention group with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05\n\nSetting\n\n8 Resuscitation Outcome Consortium sites with 114 participating EMS agencies\nAll based in USA or Canada\nJune 2011 to May 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: adults with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest\nExclusion:\n\nEMS witnessed arrest\nTraumatic injury\nAsphyxial cause of arrest\nUncontrolled bleeding or exsanguination\nPregnancy\nExisting tracheostomy or advanced airway management prior to enrolment\nManual CPR by non-study EMS or\u00a0mechanical CPR by any EMS prior to enrolment\nOpted not to participate in resuscitation research, or known to be a prisoner\n\n\n35,904 patients screened, 26,148 were eligible\n\nActive enrolment included 23,711 patients\n2,437 patients were enrolled during the run-in phase and were included in the safety analysis but not the efficacy outcome analysis\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nContinuous chest compressions\n\nChest compressions at a rate of 100/min\nAsynchronous positive pressure ventilation at 10/min commenced within 2 minutes of chest compressions starting\nVentilation maintained via \u201coral airway\u201d for first 3 cycles of ~2 minutes each\nIf no ROSC or termination of CPR, then an endotracheal or supraglottic airway was inserted as soon after 3rd cycle as possible\nContinuous chest compressions and asynchronous ventilation continued once advanced airway device inserted\n\n\n\nControl\n\nInterrupted chest compressions\n\nChest compressions at a rate of 100/min\nInterrupted for ventilation at a ratio of 30:2\nPositive pressure ventilation delivered during 5 second pause in compressions\nVentilation maintained via \u201coral airway\u201d for 3 cycles of ~2 minutes each\nIf no ROSC or termination of CPR, then an endotracheal or supraglottic airway was inserted as soon after 3rd cycle as possible\nContinuous chest compressions and asynchronous ventilation continued once advanced airway device inserted\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nOnce an advanced airway was inserted, or ROSC was achieved, CPR was standardised to existing guidelines in both groups (continuous compressions with asynchronous ventilation)\nHospital care such as temperature management or coronary intervention was monitored but not standardised\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: no statistically significant difference in survival to hospital discharge between the groups was demonstrated\n\nContinuous chest compressions: 9.7%\nInterrupted chest compressions: 9.0%\nAdjusted difference: -0.7 (95% CI -1.5 to 0.1;

the cluster and cross-over design is well suited to this area of research and the run-in phase design allowed for appropriate training to occur\nStatistical corrections \u2013 to the best of my understanding, the Huber-White sandwich correction is an appropriate statistical method to correct for non-independent events that occur in cluster randomised trials\nInternal validity \u2013 Screening over 35,000 patients to achieve a 90 power is impressive and strengthens the validity of the conclusion\n\nWeaknesses\n\nCredibility \u2013 the difference in management between the groups was only maintained until a advanced airway device was inserted (~6 minutes); considering the bigger picture of the pathophysiology and patient journey, is it even feasible that a different CPR strategy for the first 6 minutes can modify long term outcomes?\nInternal validity\u00a0\u2013 some non-study differences existed between the groups; the rate of transfer and subsequent admission to hospital was lower in the continuous group; it is unclear if this was due to early death and cessation of CPR related to the intervention (an important outcome) or if it was a choice made by an un-blinded EMS provider (an important bias); this difference biases toward a negative conclusion although it is unclear if it is \u2018false\u2019 or \u2018true\u2019\nExternal validity\u00a0\u2013 the chest compression fractions (the proportion of each minute during the first 6 minutes during which chest compressions were occurring) only differed slightly between the groups and both were greater than other observational studies have previously described; this represents high quality CPR in both groups that may not be representative of real-world resuscitation; this may produce a bias toward a false negative conclusion\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis complex trial attempted to test a subtle modification to the early phase of resuscitation care in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and did not demonstrate any convincing benefit from continuous chest compressions over conventional interrupted chest compressions\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Trial of Continuous or Interrupted Chest Compressions during CPR\n[further reading]\u00a0Resuscitation Council (UK) 2015 Guidelines on Adult Advanced Life Support\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 25 November 2015\nPeer-review editor: @DavidSlessor\n\n\n"
