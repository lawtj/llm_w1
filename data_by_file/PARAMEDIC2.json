New England Journal of Medicine 2018\nDOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1806842\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA), does the administration of epinephrine compared to placebo improve survival?\n\nBackground\n\nThere is limited evidence for the drug treatments used in Advanced Life Support (ALS).\nEpinephrine in cardiac arrest has potential beneficial effects by increasing the aortic diastolic pressure and thus increasing coronary blood flow; however harmful effects have also been hypothesised. These include increased myocardial oxygen demand, and platelet activation leading to thrombosis and impaired microvascular flow potentially increasing cerebral ischaemia.\nThere has been conflicting evidence as to whether epinephrine (adrenaline) is beneficial or not. A large Japanese observational study reported higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) but worse neurologic outcome. As a result the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation called for a large-scale RCT to see if epinephrine is safe and effective.\n\nDesign\n\nRandomized, double blinded trial\nTreatment assignments randomly generated using computer\nAllocated in a 1:1 ratio\nUniquely numbered, identical pre-prepared packs provided to ambulance service containing 10 syringes with either 1mg epinephrine or 0.9% saline\nAmbulance services entered data into a secure portal\nEthical approval sought and granted\nFunded by Health Technology Assessment Programme of the National Institute of Health Research\n\nThose funding had no role in design, data collection and analysis or manuscript preparation\n\n\nTarget sample size calculated at 8,000\n\nWith a risk ratio for the epinephrine group as 1.25 (95% CI is 1.07 \u2013 1.46) this corresponded to a 30-day survival of 6% in placebo group and 7.5% in epinephrine group\n\n\nOdd-Ratio adjusted for age, sex, interval between emergency call and ambulance arrival, interval between arrival of ambulance and administration of trial agent, initial rhythm, cause of arrest, whether arrest was witnessed or whether CPR performed by a bystander\nPre-specified sub-group analyses\nData monitoring committee (DMC) performed interim reviews every 3 months\n\nSetting\n\nConducted by 5 NHS ambulance services in the UK\nDecember 2014 \u2013 October 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nAdult Patients > 16 years old presenting with OOHCA in whom ALS had been provided by trial trained paramedics\nExclusion criteria:\n\nPregnancy (known or apparent), cause of arrest was asthma or anaphylaxis, administration of epinephrine prior to arrival of trial trained paramedics\nIn one ambulance service (London Ambulance Service), traumatic cardiac arrest was also excluded\n\n\n10,623 screened\n\n8,103 eligible (76.3%) and trial packs opened\n\nBetween opening and administration of drug or placebo more information was acquired that indicated in 87 patients there were ineligible\n2 patients had unknown trial group assignments due to missing trial pack numbers\n\n\n8014 randomized\n\n4015 in epinephrine group\n3999 in control\n\n\n2520 excluded.

in a significantly higher rate of survival at 30 days when compared to a placebo\nThere was no significant difference between groups with regards to a favourable neurological outcome\nHowever, more survivors in the epinephrine group had more severe neurological impairment.\n\nStrengths\n\nPragmatic design with large numbers of randomised patients to answer an important question with a limited evidence base\n\nThis trial provides the largest set of randomised data to date addressing this topic\n\n\nGood internal validity due to rigorous methodology\n\nExcellent strategy for concealment of random sequence to prevent selection bias\nWell balanced baseline variables suggests there is no allocation bias\nSuccessful blinding of trial participants and patients, which prevents performance bias and detection bias\nVery few patients (n=7) not included in primary analysis, reducing possible attrition bias\n\n\nGood external validity (generalisability)\n\nMultiple ambulance services enrolled patients across varying parts of the UK\nBalanced baseline characteristics\nAnalysis adjusted for measured covariates\n\n\nOutcomes clinical and patient centred\n\nDuring design of trial 280 lay people were consulted surrounding personal views on the topic\nOf these, 95% prioritized long-term survival with a favorable neurological outcome over short-term (hours \u2013 days) survival\n\n\nUses the NNT for other important interventions in the \u201cchain of survival\u201d such as bystander CPR (NNT 15) and early defibrillation (NNT 5) when contextualising the results of this trial\nIncluded Bayesian analysis for alternative interpretation\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAlthough national guidelines exist for post cardiac arrest care, hospital care was at discretion of treating teams\n\nThis is unlikely to have introduced performance bias, given the rigorous blinding of group allocation\n\n\nAlthough statistically significant, the fragility index with respect to 30 day mortality is only 6\n\nAs there were 7 patients randomised but not included in this primary outcome, it is possible that the statistical significance could be lost had these 7 been included in the analysis\n\n\nThe exclusion of those with early ROSC reduces the generalisability to that cohort\nThe discussion surrounding neurological outcome is a very important one and well presented however:\n\nThe study\u2019s primary outcome was mortality, not neurological outcome so the power to detect meaningful differences in this important secondary outcome will be low\nThere was significant loss to follow-up for the secondary outcomes\n\n20 (18.2%) in the placebo group and 29 (18.2%) in the epinephrine group were lost at 3 months\nThis may lead to attrition bias if there are differences between the patients lost from one group compared to the other group\nThis weakens the strength of the conclusion we can draw from the secondary outcome results\n\n\nFor the survivors, there was a difference in the rate of unfavourable neurological outcome at hospital discharge (epinephrine 31.0% vs placebo 17.8%) and at 3 months (16.3% vs 14.9%), so what is the best time frame to study neurological outcomes\n\nIs this observed difference due to patients that survived with unfavourable outcomes (possibly due to epinephrine administration) dying in the community after they leave hospital?\nHowever, these observed differences were not statistically significant due to the small numbers of patients surviving and this could just be variation by chance\n\n\n\n\nOverall survival rate was lower than anticipated leading to a review of the power calculation by the DMC\n\nSample size was kept the same, which provided 90% power to detect a relative risk of 1.6 (compared to initial plan of 1.25)\nThis corresponded to an Absolute Risk Reduction in mortality of 1.1%, which was still acceptable compared to the internationally agreed, clinically meaningful ARR of 1%\n\n\nNot generalizable to in-hospital setting due to dramatically different times to CPR and any drugs given\nNot strictly weaknesses, but the study produces a lot of unanswered questions:\n\nCardiac arrest is the final common pathway of multiple different physiological events so would some subgroups of arrest causes benefit more than others from epinephrine?\nAs survival to hospital was more likely in the Epinephrine group,\u00a0could this be important as newer treatments evolve, such as Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation assisted CPR, as a bridge to these treatments?\nWould different dosing regimes alter outcomes?\nIt has been suggested that a trial of [IV access + epinephrine] vs [no IV access + no epinephrine] would be important, given the possible impact from delays whilst gaining IV or IO access\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nNaturally, one\u2019s practice should be guided by Resuscitation Council guidelines\nHowever, this trial suggests epinephrine improves 30 day-mortality but it may be at the cost of worse neurological outcome\nThis is a very pragmatic, large and well-delivered trial that poses a lot more clinical and moral questions\nFurthermore, this study highlights poor survival rates for OOHCA and the fact that more needs to be done to allow better access to defibrillators and early CPR\n\nThis is something we can all help, with apps such as GoodSAM and events such as
