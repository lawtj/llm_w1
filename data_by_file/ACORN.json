JAMA 2023;330:1557-1567. doi:10.1001/jama.2023.20583\nClinical Question\n\nIn acutely ill adults (ED / ICU) does the administration of cefipime or piperacillin-tazobactam (pip-taz) result in an increased incidence of AKI or death by day 14?\n\nBackground\n\nSepsis is one of the most common reasons for admission to ICU and as such antibiotics are frequently used in the critical care environment\nThe use of anti-pseudomonal antibiotics is frequently recommended by guidelines\nDespite their multiple benefits, antimicrobial usage can cause patient harm especially with altered pharmacokinetics in critical illness\nIn particular there have been concerns regarding both pip-taz and renal dysfunction, and cefepime and neurotoxicity however the evidence for this is mixed and low-grade\nThere are limited randomised trials that seek to evaluate the risks of antibiotic associated harm\n\nDesign\n\nPragmatic, open-label, parallel-group, randomized trial\nInvestigator-initiated\nRandomised without stratification in 1:1 ratio\nUse of clinical decision tool in EMR to identify patients and subsequently randomise and place appropriate prescription of antibiotic based on eGFR\nData predominantly extracted from EMR\nClinicans asked to record reason for cessation / commencing unassigned antibiotic for 7 days following randomisation\nPrimary outcome was a novel 5 stage ordinal scale of AKI or death:\n\n0 = no new or worsening AKI\n1 = Creatinine (Cr) 1.5-1.9x baseline or increase y \u22650.3 mg/dL [\u226526.5 \u03bcmol/L])\n2 = Cr 2.0 \u2013 2.9x baseline\n3 = Cr \u2265 3.0 x baseline, Cr \u22654.0mg/dL [\u2265353.7 \u03bcmol/L] or new RRT\n4 = death\n\n\nPre-specified secondary outcomes\nInitially, 2050 patients required to provide an OR 0.65 in the primary outcome\n\nThis was increased to 2500 to account for higher use of vancomycin and powered to show an OR 0.75 in cefipime group compared to pip-taz group\n\nAn OR of 0.75 would show an absolute difference of 5% in patients with AKI or death (70% no AKI, 6% death)\nAn OR < 1.0 indicates better outcome with cefipime\n\n\n\n\nEthical waiver of consent granted\nIndependent DSMB\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre, USA\nNovember 2021 \u2013 October 2022\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n\u00a0\u2265 18 years old and located in a participating emergency department or medical intensive care unit\n< 12 hours from presentation to study hospital\nTreating clinician initiating an order for an anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin or antipseudomonal penicillin\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nKnown receipt of > 1 dose of an anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin or anti-pseudomonal penicillin during the last 7 days\nCurrent documented allergy to cephalosporins or penicillin\nA prisoner\nLack of equipoise for need for an anti-pseudomonal antibiotic\n\n\n3806 assessed \u2013> 2634 randomised \u2013> 1277 cefipime and 1357 pip-taz\n\n123 excluded: 119 did not

minutes for the initial administration followed by an extended infusion of 3.375 g every 8 hours infused over 4 hours for subsequent doses\n\nMedian 3 days duration\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nNo other anti-pseudomonal antibiotics allowed\nDuration of therapy and addition of other antibiotics (e.g. vancomycin) at clinician discretion\nDedicated clinical pharmacists in both ED and ICU\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nAKI (any stage) or death by day 14\nOR 0.95 (95% CI 0.80 \u2013 1.13)\n\nDeath: 7.6 vs 6.0% (Risk Difference 1.6%, 95% CI -0.5 to 3.6)\n\n\nNo difference with multiple sensitivity analyses (eTable 11, including per protocol, differing durations of anti-pseudomonal coverage, and receipt of vancomycin at baseline)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nComparing cefipime vs pip-taz\nNo significant difference in\n\nMajor Adverse Kidney Events (MAKE) at day 14: 10.2 vs 8.8% (Risk Difference 1.4%, 95% CI -1.0 to 3.8)\n\nNo differences between all components

0.95)\nDelirium or coma incidence: 20.8 vs 17.3% (Risk Difference 3.4%, 95% CI 0.3 \u2013 6.6)\nStill significant at day 28 (exploratory analysis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo difference in vasopressor-free days, ventilator-free days, ICU free-days and hospital-free days by day 28 (exploratory analyses)\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn hospitalised adults treatment with pip-taz as opposed to cefipime did not increase the incidence of AKI or death. Cefepime use resulted in more neurological dysfunction\n\nStrengths\n\nLarge study addressing an important and frequently used intervention with limited randomised evidence\nStrong internal validity \u2013 randomisation, allocation concealment, well balanced baseline characteristics, detailed screening log and majority received intervention\u00a0 as randomised (>95%)\nLeveraging the EMR to recruit, randomize, prescribe intervention and collect data is impressive\n\nGiven the duration from commencement of randomisation to final follow up was under a year and over 2,500 patients were randomised at a single site, the use of an EMR in this manner will likely be of increasing importance for clinical research\n\n\nMultiple sensitivity analyses for both the primary outcome and days alive and free of delirium and coma within 14 Days enhances robustness\n\nWeaknesses\n\nCould the primary outcome be more patient centric?\n\nApproximately 80% of patients in both groups had no AKI or a Stage I AKI at day 14\nIf a patient has a transient rise in creatinine that then subsequently improves it may be argued this is not a truly patient focused outcome\nHowever the counter argument would be that death was included as part of the ordinal scale, secondary outcomes were relevant and meaningful, and the clinical concern around pip-taz use was around renal impairment.\n\n\nSingle centre\n\nThis may mean some groups of patients are under-represented compared to other sites, e.g. stem cell transplants 1.3 vs 1.2% (eTable 1)\n\n\nUnblinded\nApproximately 20% of patients received alternate antibiotic within the first 14 days (eTable 7), however exposure\u00a0was similar in both groups\nMedian duration of antibiotic exposure short and only ~50% of the population retrospectively deemed to meet Sepsis III criteria by study investigators\n\nThis may bias towards the null but is reflective of the undifferentiated nature of ED presentations which made up a large proportion of randomisations\n\n\nRelatively low rates of critically unwell patients\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn my practice I have usually used pip-taz unless there is a specific clinical indication to use cefipime and I will continue to do so following this trial\nIf using cefipime it is important to stay attendant to the potential for neurotoxicity, especially in the critically ill who may have altered pharmacokinetics or blood brain barrier disruption\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Cefepime vs Piperacillin-Tazobactam in Adults Hospitalized With Acute Infection The ACORN Randomized Clinical Trial\nPodcast PulmPEEPs and ICU Ed and Todd-Cast: ACORN Trial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker @hgmwalker89\nSummary date: 17th December 2023\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\nPicture by: Petr Ganej / Pexels\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
