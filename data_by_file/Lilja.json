Circulation.2015, Published online February 13\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with out-of-hospital (OOH) cardiac arrest does a target temperature management (TTM) of 33\u00b0C\u00a0vs. 36\u00b0C\u00a0improve cognitive function at 6 months?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nTreating clinicians non-blinded\nFace-to-face follow up at ~180 days\n\nexaminers blinded for TTM allocation but not whether or not patient was a control\n\n\nWith study sample size, >80% power to detect a 10% difference between the groups based on the\u00a0Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test\u00a0profile score\n\nSetting\n\n5 European countries\nOut of 36 sites who participated in the\u00a0TTM Trial, twenty sites completed this follow-up study\nFollow-up occurred between June 2011 \u2013 September 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nFollow-up study of\u00a0TTM Trial:\n\nInclusion: adult patients who were unconscious (GCS < 8) on admission to hospital after OOH cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause.\nExclusion: > 6 hours from return of spontaneous circulation to enrolment screening, unwitnessed arrest with systole, hypothermia < 30\u00b0C, suspected or known intracranial haemorrhage.\n\n\nIn addition a control group was included:\n\ncohort of patients who had a ST elevation myocardial infarction treated with percutaneous coronary intervention\npatients matched for age, gender, country and time-point of hospitalisation\n119 control patients\n\n\n652 patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia included\n\ncomparing 33\u00b0C\u00a0vs. 36\u00b0C\u00a0group no significant difference in co-morbidities, bystander CPR, shockable rhythm\n\n\n342 patients treated with TTM alive at 180 days of whom 287 completed follow up\n\ncomparing\u00a033\u00b0C vs.\u00a036\u00b0C \u00a0vs. control group\n\nage: 63 vs. 60 vs. 64, p=0.04\nprevious ischaemic heart disease: 28% vs. 19% vs. 13%, p=0.01\nbystander CPR: 74% vs. 84% vs. N/A, p=0.03\n1st monitored rhythm shockable: 93% vs. 96% vs. N/A, p=.032\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n28 hours of temperature management with a target of\n\na)\u00a033\u00b0C\nb) 36\u00b0C\n\n\nfollowed by gradual warming to 37\u00b0C at 0.5\u00b0C per hour and avoidance of pyrexia for 72 hours from randomisation\n\nControl\n\nRecruited from cohort of ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention\n\nmatched for age, gender, country and time-point of hospitalisation\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT)\n\nno significant difference between\u00a033\u00b0C\u00a0vs. 36\u00b0C, p=0.56\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nComparing\u00a033\u00b0C\u00a0vs. 36\u00b0C,\n\nno significant difference in\n\nExecutive dysfunction as tested by\u00a0Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), p=0.43\nSymbol Digit Modalities Test\u00a0(SDMT) assessing mental speed and agitation, p=0.31\n\n\n\n\nIncluding only patients who completed follow-up and the matched STEMI controls\n\nSTEMI controls had significantly better SDMT scores than\u00a033\u00b0C and 36\u00b0C\u00a0treatment groups (unadjusted\u00a0p=0.0001,\u00a0covariate-adjusted p=0.002)\nNo significant difference in:\n\nRBMT (unadjusted p=0.46,\u00a0covariate-adjusted\u00a0p=0.06)\nFAB, (unadjusted\u00a0p=0.22,\u00a0covariate-adjusted\u00a0p=0.008)\nHospital Anxiety and Depression rating Scale (HADS),\n\ndepression, p=0.99\nanxiety, p=0.89\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nSurvivors of patients with OOH cardiac arrest who were treated with targeted temperature management of\u00a033\u00b0C\u00a0vs. 36\u00b0C\u00a0had no difference in cognitive outcome\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nBlinding of assessor of primary outcome to TTM allocation\nLow number of patients lost to follow up\nInvestigated multiple assessment measures of cognitive outcome\nUse of CONSORT diagram\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDue to the nature of the study baseline differences in cognitive function cannot be assessed. With relatively small numbers of patients included there is a greater probability of random differences in baseline cognitive function between the treatment groups\nRBMT test may be insensitive for very mild impairment. The authors stated that the updated RBMT-3 version was not available when this study commenced\nFAB has not been validated in an OOH cardiac arrest population\nProportionately fewer TTM patients with poor neurological recovery (cerebral performance category 3 or 4) were followed-up than those with good recovery. This will bias toward less cognitive impairment in the OHCA group compared to the STEMI-control group, but should still allow accurate comparison between 33\u00baC and 36\u00baC. It will under-estimate cognitive impairment from cardiac arrest. (see table for data)\n\n\n\nOf note patients in the original\u00a0TTM Trial\u00a0had a median time of 1 minute (inter-quartile range 0-2 minutes) from cardiac arrest to initiation of basic life support. Therefore these results may not apply to patients who have a delay in initiation of basic life support.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients that have basic life support quickly initiated following an OOH cardiac arrest the use of targeted temperature management of 33\u00b0C\u00a0vs. 36\u00b0C does not affect cognitive function at six months\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0Cognitive Function in Survivors of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest After Target Temperature Management at 33\u00baC Versus 36\u00baC\n[Further Reading]\u00a0ESICM Summary\n[TBL Summary]\u00a0TTM Trial Investigators: Targeted Temperature Management at 33\u00b0C versus 36\u00b0C after Cardiac Arrest\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 3rd April 2015\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n"
