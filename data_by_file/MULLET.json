NEJM (Northern Elf Journal of Musings). DOI: 25:12:2015.123\nClinical Question\n\nIn critical care doctors, does mulled wine compared to normal saline, improve the sense of well-being and ICU length of stay?\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, multi-country RCT\nPseudo-randomisation. Those who will be attending SMACC Dublin (#smaccDUB) were allocated to the mulled wine group as part of training and socialisation\nSingle blinding. Drink bottles were blackened so that the colour of the consumed liquid was not noted by the participants. However, the taste was not disguised. And those allocated to the wine became blind\nOutcome assessor blinding \u2013 as a mark of sympathy to the participants outcome assessors also became blind\nPilot trial period with subsequent adjustment of sample size following the release of the second run of SMACC tickets\nPowered at 80% to detect a 10% absolute improvement in favourable characteristics\n\nSetting\n\n55 centres through Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Ireland, Scandinavia, USA, South Africa \u00a0and Canada\nOctober \u2013 December 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: 4000 critical care doctors. 2000 allocated to the mulled wine group, 2000 to the normal saline group\nExclusion: Doctors with pre-existing alcoholic liver disease\n\nIntervention\n\nDoctors in the mulled wine group were required to drink 5 bottles of 200ml mulled wine (12 % alcohol) once a week\n\nControl\n\nDoctors in the normal saline group were required to drink 5 bottles of 200ml of normal saline once a week\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: well-being quality of life score measured at 1 hour after imbibing\n\nThere was a statistically significant higher assessment of quality of life in the mulled wine group one hour after ingestion\nBinomial analysis of \u2018how are you feeling now?\u2019 Good/Excellent 90% in mulled wine group versus 20% in normal saline group (p=0.01)\n\n\nSecondary Outcome:\n\nwell-being quality of life score\u00a0after consumption\n\nmeasured at 4 hours: 80% vs 30% p=0.04\nmeasured at 12 hours: 10% vs 40% p= 0.03\n\n\nlength of stay as a critical care doctor\n\nThose who consumed mulled wine reported that they were intending to stay on as a critical care doctor in 100% of cases, whereas only 40% of the normal saline group planned to continue as a critical care doctor\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn critical care doctors who were required to rehydrate with mulled wine once a week, quality of life was significantly higher as was the intention to continue working in the critical care environment\n\nStrengths\n\nTrial protocol published a priori in Santa\u2019s newsletter\nParticipating centres all had evidence of prior exposure to rehydration with similar fluids and this peaked in June 2015 in Chicago\nDoctor centred outcomes rather than surrogate endpoints\nPragmatic design and based on similar current practices\nComplete follow-up make the validity of the results strong although many participants had a high fragility index at the 12 hour mark\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe binomial distribution of results means the statistical robustness is less than an ordinal analysis, but with such clear margins the results are highly likely to be true\nThe pseudo-randomised nature of the trial may mean that those who are planning to attend SMACC have a natural love for life and positivity and this could have biased the result\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn critical care doctors, imbibing mulled wine in the pre-Christmas season was associated with a significantly higher well-being score and intention to remain as a critical care doctor\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0MULLET Trial: The Mulled Wine versus Normal Saline Evaluation Trial for Rehydration in The Critical Care Setting\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @celiabradford\nSummary date: 18th December 2015\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler, @davidslessor, @avkwong, @stevemathieu75 \u00a0& the post publication peer review #FOAMed elves\n\n\n"
