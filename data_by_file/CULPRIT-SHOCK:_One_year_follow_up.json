NEJM 2018 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1808788\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock and evidence of multi-vessel disease on early diagnostic angiography, does immediate multi-vessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to culprit lesion only PCI (with staged revascularisation) improve outcome?\n\nBackground\n\nEarly revascularization has been shown to reduce mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction that is complicated by cardiogenic shock\nMost patients with cardiogenic shock present with multi-vessel coronary artery disease,\u00a0which is associated with\u00a0higher mortality than single-vessel disease\nESC and AHA/ACC 2014 guidelines recommend PCI of all high-grade lesions in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock, while in haemodynamically stable patients without shock culprit-lesion, only PCI should be preferred\nThe 30-day results of the Culprit Lesion Only PCI versus Multi- vessel PCI in Cardiogenic Shock (CULPRIT-SHOCK) trial challenged these guidelines. This study demonstrated the risk of a composite of death from any cause or severe renal failure leading to renal-replacement therapy was lower with culprit-lesion-only PCI\nPCI to culprit lesion is established standard of care but the management of non-culprit lesions is debatable and without longer term follow up\n\nDesign\n\nProspective, randomised, international multicentre trial\nOpen-label\n1:1 randomisation\nBlock randomisation (4 to 6 patients) using internet-based programme\nStratification according to study centre\nPower calculation\n\nBaseline 30 day mortality from registries approximately 50% in immediate multi-vessel PCI group and 39% in culprit lesion only PCI group\n706 patients targeted (assuming 3% dropout) to provide trial with 80% power to detect a difference between the two groups i.e. reject null-hypothesis (alpha 0.048)\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n83 European centres\nApril 2013 \u2013 April 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAcute myocardial infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI)\nPlanned early revascularization by PCI\nMultivessel coronary artery disease defined as >70% stenosis in at least 2 major vessels (\u22652 mm diameter) with identifiable culprit lesion\nSystolic blood pressure <90 mmHg for >30 min or catecholamines required to maintain pressure >90 mmHg during systole\nSigns of pulmonary congestion\nSigns of impaired organ perfusion with at least one of the following criteria\n\nAltered mental status\nCold, clammy skin and extremities\nOliguria with urine output <30 ml/h\nSerum lactate >2.0 mmol/l\n\n\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nResuscitation of >30 minutes\nNo intrinsic cardiac activity\nAssumed neurological devastation\nIndication for primary urgent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)\nMechanical cause of cardiogenic shock, or noncardiogenic shock\nOnset of shock >12 hours before randomization\nAge >90 years\nMassive pulmonary embolism\nKnown severe chronic kidney disease\nLife expectancy <6 months\n\n\n1075 patients screened, 706 randomised, 686 provided full informed consent\n\nTotal 2 lost to follow up by 1 year\nMedian age: 70 years\nMale: 75%\nNumber of affected vessels at diagnostic angiography similar in both groups\n\n36% with 2 vessel disease\n63% with 3 vessel disease\n\n\n\n\n\nCulprit-lesion only PCI\n\nCulprit-lesion treated first\nAll other lesions left untreated at time of initial procedure\nFurther staged revascularisation was recommended on the basis of patient\u2019s clinical status and the presence of residual ischaemia on object testing\n\nMulti-vessel PCI\n\nCulprit-lesion treated first\nAll other major coronary arteries with >70% stenosis of diameter (including chronic occlusions) treated\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nStandard PCI technique with recommended use of drug-eluting stents\nMaximum dose of contrast material = 300 mls\nTransferred to ICU post-intervention for continuous ECG and invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring\nAll other therapies (including use of mechanical support devices and renal replacement therapy) left at the discretion of clinical team\nStructured follow up interview at 6 and 12 months\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nComposite outcome \u2013 30 day all cause mortality or renal failure leading to replacement therapy favours culprit-lesion only PCI\n\nSignificantly lower in culprit-only PCI (45.9% vs 55.4%; Absolute risk reduction 9.5, CI 2 to 17%, p=0.01, NNT=11)\nSub-analysis showed that this was primarily due to mortality rather than renal replacement therapy requirements\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome at 1 year:\n\nNo significant difference between groups\n\nDeath from any cause\nRenal replacement therapy\nRecurrent myocardial infarction\nBleeding rates\n\n\nCulprit-lesion only PCI group had significantly higher\n\nStaged or urgent repeat revascularisation\nRehospitalisation for congestive heart failure\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, 30 days risk of a composite of death from any cause or renal-replacement therapy was significantly lower with culprit-lesion-only PCI than with multi-vessel PCI\nThe mortality difference was not significant at 1 year but the incidence of rehospitalisation for heart failure was higher and repeat revascularisation was more frequent with culprit-lesion-only PCI than with multi-vessel PCI\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre\nRelevant and important clinical question\nMinimal patients lost to follow up\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe end points in the 1-year analysis are exploratory because the trial was only powered for the 30-day analysis of the primary composite end point\nOpen label nature of the study allows for bias in the ascertainment of outcomes and may affect some of secondary outcomes e.g. patients known to be randomised to culprit lesion-only PCI may be more likely to undergo urgent revascularisation due to knowledge that initial revascularisation was targeted\n43 patients crossed over from culprit-lesion only PCI to multi-vessel PCI (for reasons including lack of haemodynamic improvement, discovery of new lesions after initial PCI), potentially leading to bias toward including more complex and co-morbid patients in the multi-vessel PCI group\n24% of patients in the multi-vessel arm had a chronic occlusion for which revascularisation was attempted (81% successful). The benefit of revascularisation of chronic total occlusions is unclear particularly in the cardiogenic shock setting, and so mandated revascularisation of these lesions may have contributed to the worse outcomes observed in the multi-vessel PCI group\n50% of patients required resuscitation prior to PCI, it would be more useful to have neurological status as a more patient-centred outcome\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, a more targeted PCI strategy may be more beneficial excepting that further intervention (PCI and hospitalisation) may be required in the future\nThe results of this trial supports the most recent change in European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on Myocardial Revascularisation 2018 where intervention to non-culprit lesions has been downgraded from level II to level III\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] One-year outcomes after PCI strategies in cardiogenic shock\n[article]\u00a0PCI strategies in patients with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock.
