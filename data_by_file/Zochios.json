Anaesthesia 2018; 73:1478-1488. doi:10.1111/anae.14345\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients at high risk of respiratory complications after cardiac surgery, does the routine application of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO2) compared to standard oxygen reduce hospital length of stay?\n\nBackground\n\nCardiac surgery patients are at high risk of postoperative pulmonary complications due to a variety of factors. Postoperative pulmonary dysfunction in this population has been termed \u201cinevitable\u201d.\u00a0 High-flow nasal oxygen has gained popularity over recent years and has been investigated in a number of settings, both in theatres and on ICU as a novel method of providing respiratory support for high risk patients.\nPatients with pre-existing respiratory disease are more likely to develop lower respiratory tract infections, have prolonged length of ICU stay and are at increased risk of re-admission to ICU for respiratory support. High-flow nasal oxygen may reduce atelectasis, improve oxygenation and improve clearance of CO2 and respiratory tract secretions hence prevent the development of respiratory failure.\nHFNO2 has been shown to reduce re-intubation rates compared to standard oxygen therapy in both general ICU patients and elective postoperative cardiac surgical patients. It has been found to be non-inferior to BiPAP in patients at high risk of respiratory failure in both general and cardiac ICU settings with regards to re-intubation.\nNo previous study has looked at the effect of prophylactic HFNO2 on ICU and hospital length of stay in cardiac surgical patients at high risk of postoperative respiratory complications.\n\nDesign\n\nSingle-centre, randomised controlled trial\nCentralised, online 1:1, block randomisation with random block sizes\nPatients and ICU team not blinded but surgical and nursing teams on the surgical ward were unaware of allocation\nSample size calculation: power of 90% to detect a mean reduction of 2 day in hospital length of stay => 92 patients required\n\nIncreased to 100 to allow for loss to follow up\n\n\nModified intention-to-treat analysis\n\nTwo patients in each group were not extubated by 10am Day 1 postop, 1 withdrew consent and 1 operation was cancelled\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre trial \u2013 Royal Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, UK\nAugust 2015 \u2013 January 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nElective cardiac surgery, >18 years old\n\u22651 of the following risk factors:\n\nformal diagnosis of COPD/Asthma,\nlower respiratory tract infection in preceding 4 weeks, BMI\u226535,\ncurrent(within last 6 weeks) heavy smoker(>10 pack years)\n\n\nCapable of performing 6-minute walk test (6MWT)\n\n\nExclusion: contraindication to HFNO2 (nasal septal defect), CPAP pre-operatively, patients who did not meet extubation criteria by 10am on first postoperative day\n1714 patients screened, 100 randomised, 6 excluded from analysis, 94 patients analysed (HFNO2 n=49 vs. Standard oxygen therapy n=45)\nComparable baseline characteristics including logistic EuroScore\n\nIntervention\n\nHigh-flow nasal oxygen therapy (Optiflow\u00ae device)\n\nFiO2 titrated to achieve SpO2\u226595%, or \u226593% if at risk of hypercapnoeic respiratory failure. FiO2 actively titrated down to minimum suitable level\nGas flow: started at 30 L/min, adjusted between 20-50 L/min to achieve respiratory rate <16 and patient comfort\nCould continue on HFNO2 for more than 24h if deemed necessary\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard oxygen therapy\n\nLow flow nasal cannulae or soft facemask\nO2 flow titrated to SpO2\u226595%, or \u226593% if at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nO2 therapy discontinued after 24h unless evidence of deterioration (desaturation or tachypnoea)\nStandard postoperative respiratory care with regards to physiotherapy, and chest drain removal\nManagement of deteriorating patients: increase FiO2, CPAP/Non-invasive Ventilation, and invasive ventilation\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Hospital length of stay was less in the HFNO2 group\n\nMedian hospital length of stay\n\nHFNO2: median 7 days\nStandard O2: median 9 days\nP = 0.012\n\n\nMean hospital length of stay\n\nReduced by 29%\n\n\nIncidence of prolonged stay (>10 days)\n\nHFNO2: 18.7%\nStandard O2: 38.6%\nAbsolute Risk Reduction: 19.9% (P = 0.026)\nNumber needed to treat: 5\nFragility Index: 1\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\n\n\nICU length of stay: no difference\nICU re-admission rate: 2% vs. 15.6%, p: 0.026\n\nNNT: 7.4\nFragility index: 1\n\n\nIn-hospital mortality: 1 death in each group\nExtra-pulmonary complications: no difference\nPulmonary function tests and 6MWT (day 5 or 6 postop)\n\nPostop pulmonary function tests only performed in two-thirds of patients: no difference\nPostop 6MWT completed by less than half of patients: no difference\n\n\nPostoperative quality of recovery (PQRS questionnaire recorded on admission, before discharge and at 1 month postop): no difference in any of the domains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe routine use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy following extubation of cardiac surgical patients with risk factors for postoperative respiratory complications may reduce hospital length of stay and re-admission to ICU\n\nStrengths\n\nClearly defined study hypothesis and useful primary outcome\nAppropriate power with prior power calculation for primary outcome\nWell defined inclusion and exclusion criteria\nAppropriate randomisation, with similar baseline Logistic EUROScores\nSurgical and ward nursing staff, who influenced decision to discharge (primary outcome) were unaware of treatment allocation\nEffort to report recovery profiles which is an important patient reported outcome measure\n\nHowever unclear how many patients were followed up post-op to provide this data\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle centre study, limits generalisability\nFragility index of 1 for both prolonged length of stay beyond 10 days and ICU re-admission, meaning if a single patient in the control group had a different outcome, the results would lose statistical significance\nOnly elective patients who were extubated by the following morning were included in the study and the analysis\n\nTherefore the results may not be applicable to patients who had emergency surgery or had a longer period of invasive ventilation\n\n\nThe standard oxygen group had more patients who had a combined procedures\n\nCABG+valve(s): 8 vs. 13, HFNO2 and standard oxygen respectively\nCombined procedures are associated with higher risk of postoperative complications and prolonged length of stay\n\n\n4 patients in the standard oxygen group crossed over to HFNO2 after 24h, receiving therapy for 48-72 hours\n\nThis may have reduced their risk of re-admission to ICU and improved their recovery, potentially resulting in an underestimation of the intervention effect\n\n\nPatients in the HFNO2 group were allowed to remain on this as long as necessary, even after ICU discharge, on the surgical ward\n\nIt is unclear how many patients received HFNO2 therapy, and for how long, beyond the initial 24h period\nIf prolonged therapy was common, this may affect generalisability to hospitals where surgical wards don\u2019t provide HFNO2\n\n\nSignificant attrition at postoperative pulmonary function testing and 6MWT, therefore likely underpowered to show any difference\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis was a well-designed and adequately powered RCT with an important and useful primary outcome adding to the growing evidence supporting the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy in high risk postoperative patients\nThese results are of great importance to all cardiac surgical units and may help inform equipment procurement and staff training to allow increased turnover of patients and reduce the rate of cancellations due to bed shortages\nBased on these results I would strongly consider the use of HFNO2 for postop cardiac surgical patients with additional risk factors for pulmonary complications\nHowever a larger, multi-centre trial would be desirable to validate the results and improve generalisability\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0The effect of high\u2010flow nasal oxygen on hospital length of stay in cardiac surgical patients at high risk for respiratory complications: a
