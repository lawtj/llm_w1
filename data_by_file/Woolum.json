Crit Care Med 2018; 46:1747-1752. doi:10.1097.CCM.0000000000003311\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with septic shock, does the administration of thiamine lead to more rapid lactate clearance and improved clinical outcomes?\n\nBackground\n\nSeptic shock is characterised by a hypermetabolic state that resembles thiamine deficiency\nThiamine, also known as Vitamin B1, can be deficient in critically ill patients\nPrevious pilot randomised, controlled trials have shown significantly lower lactate levels and improved mortality over time in patients with septic shock who were thiamine deficient\n\nDesign\n\nRetrospective, matched cohort study, based on data collected from medical records\n\nCohorts were matched using Mahalanobis distance matching (a multivariate statistical method to detect outliers from a normal distribution) according to\n\nICU service (medical vs surgical)\nPresence of liver disease\nPeak lactate\nSOFA score on day of ICU admission\nElixhauser comorbidity index\nAge\nGender\nRace\n\n\n\n\nRegression analysis was performed with mortality as a competing event\n\nIf the patient died before lactate clearance was achieved, clearance was considered not achieved\nThat is to say, death and lactate clearance were considered mutually exclusive outcomes\n\n\nThree models were constructed\n\nwith lactate levels alone\nafter adjustment for age, gender and race\nwith age, gender, race and other likely factors that influence mortality and lactate clearance\n\n\nA Cox proportional hazards model was constructed along the same lines for 28-day mortality according to event-rate analysis\n\nSetting\n\nA single academic centre in the USA\nJanuary 2013 to December 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nAn electronic medical database was queried based on the diagnostic code for septic shock according to 9th or 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)\nInclusion: Patients who were coded as septic shock on the electronic medical database; 18 years and older; admission to medical or surgical services\nExclusion: Septic shock not present at admission (lactate < 2 mmol/L or vasopressor therapy not required); missing baseline data\nAfter validation using the Sepsis-3 criteria:\n\n1049 patients were included out of the 2270 patients who were initially screened\n\nComparing Thiamine (n=123) vs No Thiamine (n=926), where * means P value is less than 0.05:\n\nMean age: 52 vs 60 years*\nGender: 56% vs 51%\nRace: 92% vs 93% white\nLiver disease: 65% vs 34%*\nElixhauser comorbidity index: 4 vs 4\nMedical admission: 97% vs 83%*\nSOFA Score: 10 vs 9*\nSteroid administration: 53% vs 47%\nPeak lactate: 6.1 vs 5.2 mmol/L*\n\n\n\n\nOut of this cohort, 123 patients who received thiamine (any dose within 24 hours of hospital admission) were matched with 246 patients who did not\n\nAll variables listed above were matched and were almost equal\n\nP values were all above 0.238 (most were 1.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nThiamine\n\nIntravenous administration of thiamine in any dose within the first 24 hours of hospital admission\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNo thiamine\n\nPatients who received thiamine were matched with a cohort who did not receive thiamine in a 1:2 ratio\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll care was delivered at the discretion of the treating clinical team\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: \n\nLactate clearance was defined as\n\nTime from hospital admission to lactate of \u2264 2 mmol/L, or\nTime from hospital admission to lowest lactate plus 24 hours (if no documented lactate < 2 mmol/L and patient survived)\n\n\nLactate clearance was more rapid in those who were administered intravenous thiamine in the first 24 hours of their hospital admission\nAll three regression models revealed improved lactate clearance with thiamine administration\nThe subdistribution hazard ratios in the three models ranged between 1.292 and 1.339\nThe effect of thiamine on lactate clearance was significantly more in female patients on a gender-based interaction model\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nSurvival was censored at 28 days or hospital discharge\nThiamine was found to significantly reduce 28-day mortality on the three Cox proportional hazard models\n\nHazard ratio for death 0.666 (95% CI 0.490 to 0.905)\n\n\nThe benefit was more evident in female patients\nThere was no significant difference in other secondary outcomes including\n\nSOFA scores on day 5 compared to baseline\nVasopressor-free days\nVentilator-free days\nICU-free days\nIncidence of AKI\nRequirement for renal replacement therapy\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with septic shock, intravenous thiamine, administered within 24 hours of ICU admission resulted in more rapid lactate clearance and a significantly reduced 28-day mortality\n\nStrengths\n\nThis is a large study that evaluated the effect of thiamine on lactate clearance and mortality in patients with septic shock\nMatching was carried out between patients who had thiamine and those who did not, in an attempt to remove confounding variables\nRegression analysis was performed with mortality as the competing event, which is appropriate given the high mortality rate observed\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThis is a retrospective observational study based on data derived from electronic medical records\n\nThe baseline differences prior to matching demonstrate that the Thiamine vs No Thiamine cohorts are very different populations, and this suggests that matching will not remove all confounding variables\n\n\nThe dose of thiamine was variable and ranged 100\u2013500 mg/\n\nThe study centre\u2019s protocol was to administer high dose (500 mg x3 daily) thiamine for 72 hours\n\n\nThiamine levels were not measured\n\nIt is unclear whether the benefit may be related to thiamine deficiency\n\n\nThe mortality of the cohort was high compared to contemporaneous studies (54%), which the authors attribute to a relatively large number of patients with cirrhosis\n\nThis limits the generalisability of the conclusion to other populations\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study adds to the growing body of evidence that intravenous thiamine may improve outcomes in patients with sepsis and septic shock\nHowever, given the inherent biases in this relatively small observational study, the conclusion should be hypothesis generating and supportive of a larger randomised, controlled trial\nIn my opinion, given that harmful effects are unlikely, intravenous thiamine may be considered in critically ill patients with sepsis\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of Thiamine Administration on Lactate Clearance and Mortality in Patients with Septic Shock by Woolum et al\n[further reading]\u00a0Vitamine C and Thiamine in Sepsis review article from ESICM\n[further reading]\u00a0Have We Found The Cure For Sepsis review by REBELem\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Jose Chacko\nSummary date: 25 April 2019\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
