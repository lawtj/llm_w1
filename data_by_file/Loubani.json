Journal of Critical Care 2015; 30(3):654. doi:10.1016/j.jcrc.2015.01.014\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients who are administered vasopressor medication intravenously, what are the published reports on local tissue injury and extravasation?\n\nDesign\n\nSystematic, narrative, review\nTwo authors\n\nInitial screening of papers by one\nFull review of final papers by both with consensus resolution\n\n\nSearch Strategy\n\nMedline, Embase and Cochrane Library\nPerformed January 2014 with coverage back to 1946\nNo language restriction\nLimited to human subjects\nBackward reference mapping performed\nInclusion: case reports, case series, observational cohort studies, randomised controlled trials\nSelection: 78,671 abstracts screened, 598 full-text reviewed, 85 papers included\n\n\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: age over 18 years\nExclusion: not cases of cardiac arrest\n\nIntervention\n\nAdministration of IV vasopressors via peripheral or central venous line\n\ndopamine\nepinephrine / adrenaline\nnorepinephrine / noradrenaline\nvasopressin\nterlipressin\nphenylephrine\nephedrine\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nComplications:\n\nEvents were categorised into extravasation (evidence of escape of drug into the surrounding tissues, with or without injury) or local tissue injury\u00a0(evidence of tissue injury with close association to the administration of vasopressors) \u2013 not mutually exclusive categories\n64% of events caused local tissue injury\n98% of these injuries were associated with peripheral venous catheters\nTissue injuries included skin necrosis, tissue necrosis, or gangrene\n\n\nDrugs:\n\nData were collected on the following drugs when provided:\n\nNorad / Norepi \u2013 219 events (217 via peripheral line, 3 via central line)\nDopamine \u2013 36 events (all via peripheral line)\nAdren / Epineph \u2013 18 events (17 via peripheral line, 1 via central line)\nVasopressin \u2013 16 events (14 via peripheral line, 2 via central line)\nTerlipressin \u2013 4 events (3 via peripheral line, 1 via central line)\nPhenylephrine \u2013 6 events (all via peripheral line)\nEphedrine \u2013 2 events (all via peripheral line)\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n\nRegarding peripheral venous catheters, 62% of reported events were associated with peripherally placed catheters\n\nDistal to anticubital fossa (ACF) or knee \u2013 213 events\nAt ACF or more proximal \u2013 133 events\n\n\n\n\nDuration:\n\nThe durations of infusion prior to events were described in 80%\nThe median duration was 24 hours for peripheral venous catheters and 22 hours for central venous catheters\nMost injuries occurred after 6 or more hours of infusion\n\n\nGauge of peripheral venous catheter\n\nExtravasation was most commonly associated with 22-gauge lines\nThe catheter gauge was rarely reported\n\n\nLong-term sequelae\n\nSimple extravasation was infrequently associated with harm\nTissue injury was associated with long-term disability in 25% of described events, and death in 2%\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAdministration of vasopressors via peripheral IV lines for short term (<2 hours) and that are placed at, or more proximal than, the anticubital fossa (ACF) are unlikely to lead to extravasation or local tissue injury\nThis should be a temporising measure during an emergency, and should be replaced by a central venous line as soon as possible\n\nStrengths\n\nWell constructed literature search with clearly defined population, intervention and outcomes of interest\nAssessment of many thousands of articles for relevance\nAuthors contacted for more recent articles to acquire specific patient-level data for analysis\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNarrative review so exact numbers are less important\nUnable to define the denominator, so event rates or incidence of complications cannot be calculated\nReporting bias may lead to over-estimation of risk with peripheral lines and under-estimation of risk with central lines\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis narrative review provides no firm conclusion\nFrom the distribution of events described, it is reasonable to conclude that the use proximal venous catheters for not more than 6 hours in emergencies, whilst a central venous catheter is inserted, is acceptable\nThis work should form a base for subsequent trials if the question remains clinically relevant\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0A systematic review of extravasation and local tissue injury from administration of vasopressors through peripheral intravenous catheters and central
