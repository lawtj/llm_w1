DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2200644\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients with sepsis receiving vasopressor therapy, does a high dose of vitamin C in comparison to placebo, reduce the risk of death or persistent organ dysfunction at 28 days?\n\nBackground\n\nIn sepsis, the antioxidant effects of vitamin C therapy may mitigate tissue injury induced by oxidative stress\nA single center study published in 2017 suggested that the early use of intravenous vitamin C, together with corticosteroids and thiamine, were effective in preventing progressive organ dysfunction, and in reducing the mortality of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, which spurred an interest in Vitamin C\nThe CITRIS-ALI Trial demonstrated that high dose Vitamin C did not significantly reduce organ failure scores or improve biomarker levels, in patients with sepsis and ARDS\nRecent meta-analysis showed Metabolic resuscitation with vitamin C, glucocorticoids, vitamin B1, or combinations of these was not significantly associated with a decrease in longer-term mortality\nAlthough another meta-analysis suggested IV vitamin C administration appears safe and may be associated with a trend towards reduction in overall mortality\n\nDesign\n\nInternational multicenter, Concealed-Allocation, Parallel-Group, Blinded, Randomized Controlled Trial\nLiving umbrella RCT\nRandomized 1:1 using centralized Web based system using permuted blocks of variable, undisclosed size and stratified according to the site\nWritten informed consent\nCompletely blinded except for on site pharmacist who prepared the solution\nBased on a power of 80% and Type 1 error of 5%, a sample size of 385 selected for each group\nTo account for withdrawal of consent and loss to follow-up, plan to enroll 400 patients per group was made\nAllocation further inflated to include COVID Patients\n\nSetting\n\n35 adult medical\u2013surgical ICUs in Canada, France, and New Zealand\nPatients enrolled From November 14, 2018, to July 19, 2021\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nPatients \u226518 years old\nAdmitted to ICU with proven or suspected infection as the main diagnosis\nCurrently treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of vasopressors (norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, dopamine, phenylephrine)\n\n\nExclusion:\n\n>24 hours of intensive care unit (ICU) admission\nKnown Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency\nPregnancy\nKnown allergy to vitamin C\nKnown kidney stones within the past 1 year\nReceived any intravenous vitamin C during this hospitalization unless incorporated in parenteral nutrition\nExpected death or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments within 48 hours\nPreviously enrolled in this study\nPreviously enrolled in a trial for which co-enrolment is not allowed (co-enrolment to be determined case by case)\n\n\n2234 screened \u2013> 872 randomized ->8 patients further found to be ineligible ->1 further withdrew consent\nThe actual number of patients who completed follow up at 28 days were\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n429 in Vitamin C group\n434 in Placebo group\n\n\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of Vitamin C vs. Placebo group\n\nAge(yrs): 65.0 vs 65.2\nFemale Sex (%): 35.2 vs 40\nAdmission type\n\nMedical (%) :81.6 vs 85.2\nSurgical (%): 18.4 vs 14.8\n\n\nAPACHE II Score: 24.2 vs 24.1\nSOFA score: 10.2 vs 10.1\nPrimary site of infection (%)\n\nPulmonary: 33.8 vs 36.7\nGastrointestinal or intra-abdominal: 31 vs 25.9\n\n\nSARS CoV-2 Positive (%): 8.6 vs 6.0\nLactate mmol/liter: 3.4 vs 3.0\nVitamin C level \u00b5mol/liter: 20.6 vs 19.1\nSeptic shock (requirement for a vasopressor infusion and a lactate >2 mmol per liter) (%): 59.6 vs 56.1\nTime from ICU admission to randomization (hr): 12.9 vs 12.3\nTreatment (%)\n\nGlucocorticoids: 46.4 vs 45.4\nMechanical ventilation: 68.5 vs 65.4\nRenal Replacement therapy: 10.7 vs 9.7\nVasopressor infusion: 99.8 vs 100\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nHigh dose vitamin C\n\n50 mg per kilogram actual body wt mixed in a 50-ml solution of either dextrose 5% in water or normal saline\nAdministered over 30 to 60 minutes every 6 hours for 96 hours (i.e., 200 mg per kilogram per day, with a maximum of 16 doses) as long as patients remained in the ICU\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\nReceived a matching placebo infusion (dextrose 5% in water or normal saline)\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nNone specified\nAll co-interventions including glucocorticoids and thiamine were performed at the discretion of treating teams and were recorded\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nComposite of death or persistent organ dysfunction (defined as receipt of vasopressors, invasive mechanical ventilation, or new renal-replacement therapy) on trial day 28 \u2013 significantly higher in Vitamin C group\nVit C 191/429 (44.5%) vs Placebo 167/434 (38.5%)\nRisk ratio, 1.21;
