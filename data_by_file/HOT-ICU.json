Schj\u00f8rring, N Engl J Med 2021 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2032510\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, does a lower vs higher oxygenation target reduce mortality at 90 days?\n\nBackground\n\nPatients admitted to the ICU with hypoxaemic respiratory failure often receive supplemental oxygen with a high fraction of inspired oxygen\nHyperoxia is potentially harmful, with sequelae such as resorption atelectasis, lung injury and oxidative stress. It remains unclear what the optimal oxygenation target should be that balances the risks of hypoxia and hyperoxia\nClinical practice guidelines give no clear recommendation for an optimal oxygenation target in hypoxaemic patients in ICU, aside from the setting of ARDS where a conservative range (PaO2 55 \u2013 80mmHg) has been adopted based on historical data from the ARDSnet study\nThere have been a number of trials performed recently to address this issue with conflicting results. While the OXYGEN-ICU study demonstrated that lower oxygenation targets (SpO2 94-98%/PaO2 70 \u2013 100mmHg) yield a mortality benefit, the study had a number of methodological issues. ICU-ROX\u00a0did not demonstrate any difference in ventilator-free days between conservative and usual oxygen therapy. LOCO2\u00a0demonstrated no difference in 28-day mortality between liberal or conservative oxygenation targets in patients with ARDS. However, it did signal a potential for harm with conservative targets from its analysis of secondary outcomes\n\nDesign\n\nRandomized controlled trial\nInternational, multi-centre\nComputer-generated allocation concealment with permuted block-randomization\nSingle-blinded: outcome-assessors were blinded, clinicians were not\nBased on a power of 90%, a sample size of 2928 patients would provide the ability to detect an absolute between group mortality difference of 5% at 90 days. This corresponds to a 20% mortality difference, assuming a death rate of 25% at day 90, with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05\n\nSetting\n\n35 ICUs in Denmark, Switzerland, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, United Kingdom and Iceland\nPatients enrolled from June 20, 2017 to August 3, 2020\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdults acutely admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure\nReceiving supplemental O2, with a flow of at least 10L via an open system OR at least an FiO2 of 0.5 via a closed-system (including NIV and CPAP)\nExpected to receive supplemental O2 for the next 24 hours in the ICU\nArterial line placed\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nNot randomized within 12 hours of ICU admission\nChronic mechanical ventilation for any reason\nHome O2 therapy\nPrevious bleomycin treatment\nOrgan transplant within current hospital admission\nWithdrawal of active therapies or death deemed imminent\nPregnancy\nCO poisoning, CN\u2013 poisoning, methaemoglobinaemia, paraquat poisoning\nNeed for hyperbaric O2\nSickle cell disease\n\n\n2928 patients enrolled; 2888 (98.6%) included in primary analysis\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nAge: 70 vs 70\nMale: 63.7% vs 64.9%\nPneumonia the main acute illness: 57.7% vs 57.4%\nARDS: 12.3% vs 13.4%\nInvasive ventilation: 57.4% vs 59.7%\nNIV and CPAP: 13.7% vs 12.1%\nMedian tidal volume and PEEP: 499ml vs 499ml AND 8cmH2O vs 7cmH2O\n\nMedian P/F ratio: 118.6 vs 117.5\nMedian SOFA score: 9 vs 9\nUse of vasoactive agents: 55.1% vs 54.3%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nLower oxygen target\n\nOxygen therapy targeting a PaO2 of 60mmHg (8kPa)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nHigher oxygen targey\n\nOxygen therapy targeting a PaO2 of 90mmHg (12kPa)\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nOxygen supplementation devices and ventilator settings chosen by the clinicians\nAll other ICU interventions determined by clinicians\nSchedule of ABGs not mandated, but assumed 4 measurements per day\nSpO2 correlated to PaO2 after each ABG\nEpisodic weaning of FiO2, based on the results of ABG analysis.

This cohort may have influenced the results\nMedian age of the population was high, a large proportion had medical illnesses and 20% had COPD. A high proportion of patients had ARDS, high P:F ratios and the overall mortality in this population was higher than expected. The results of this study may not apply to low-risk populations with hypoxaemic respiratory failure\nAlthough a pa02 of 60mmHg was targeted, the intervention group had a median pa02 of 70.8 (IQR 66.6-76.5), compared to a median of 93.3 (IQR 87.1-98.7) in the control arm\nBetween-group differences in values for PaO2, FiO2 and SpO2 diminished over the observation period, as patients often left the ICU between day 14 and 21\nThis study has not yet answered the question of the effect of different oxygenation targets in key subgroups of patients, including traumatic brain injury and hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (sub-group analysis pending)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile this trial does not change my practice, it is reassuring to see that targeting a PaO2 of 60mmHg (and delivering a Pa02 of ~70mmHg) for patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure does not result in harm\nI will continue to use the minimal FiO2 possible to maintain my patients\u2019 SpO2>90%, whilst awaiting further trials such as MEGA-ROX\nThis trial adds to the current evidence base, which suggests that oxygenation targets aiming between PaO2 of 60 \u2013 90mmHg may balance the risks of hypoxia and hyperoxia\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Lower or Higher Oxygenation Targets for Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure\n[further reading] Oxygen targets in critical care: The HOT-ICU trial.
