Neurocritical Care 2019; doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-018-0642-5\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients presenting within 12 hours of an acute ischaemic stroke (AIS), which of three targeted and pre-specified systolic blood pressure (SBP) ranges results in an improved functional outcome at 90 days?\n\nBackground\n\nSignificant hypo- and hypertension is associated with poorer outcomes following AIS, following a U-shaped distribution for functional recovery\nHypotension may lead to under perfusion of the injured brain, wheras hypertension may increase the risk of haemorrhagic transformation\nMost guidelines recommend a SBP between 140mmHg and 220mmHg in the acute phase\nThe American Stroke Association guidelines state that the benefits of initiating hypertension treatment in the first 48-72 hours are uncertain, although a decrease of 15% in the initial SBP might be reasonable\nThe CATIS study was a large Chinese study published in JAMA in 2014, showing no improvement in functional outcomes with SBP lower in the first 24 hours following cerebrovascular accident (CVA)\nThe recently published RIGHT2 study assessed the use of pre-hospital nitrates to lower pre-hospital blood pressure following suspected CVA but showed no difference in functional outcomes\nThe optimal target for SBP following acute stroke is therefore unclear at present\nThis study aimed to answer that question by investigating functional outcomes for three SBP targets in acute stroke patients not receiving thrombolysis\n\nDesign\n\nA randomised, single centre controlled trial\nComputer generated random sequence\nOpen label study\nOutcome assessment blinded\nThe primary endpoint was \u2018good outcome\u2019, defined as modified Rankin Score (mRS) 0\u20132 at 90-days\nSample size of 75 patients per group (total of 225 patients) would provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between treatment groups for a good outcome on mRS\nAnalysis on modified intention to treat principle (5.6% of randomized patients excluded due to final diagnosis being non-stroke after subsequent investigations\nDifferences examined among three randomised groups and between manipulated or non-manipulated SBP\n\nSetting\n\nA public university hospital in southern Brazil\nDecember 2009 to December 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adult patients \u2265 18 years of age with AIS, presenting within 12 hours of symptom onset and unsuitable for IV thrombolysis according to current guidelines\nExclusion: Poor life expectancy, pregnancy, acute heart failure, acute coronary event in the previous 3 months, previous intracranial hemorrhage, previous ischemic stroke with a premorbid mRS > 1, history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy (including warfarin use), thrombocytopenia (< 100,000/mm3 ), major surgery within the previous 6 weeks, and renal failure on renal dialysis.\n1033 AIS patients screened; 36% excluded for receiving thrombolysis; 23% excluded as pre-stroke mRS was > 1; 8% excluded for acute heart failure and 10.7% for other reasons.\n231 patients randomized, 77 patients to each of the three SBP target groups\n\nComparing baseline characteristics between Group 1 (target 140-160mmHg) vs. Group 2 (target 161-180mmHg) vs. Group 3 (target 181-200)\n\nPatients excluded post randomization due to stroke mimic\n\nSignificantly higher in Group 3: 0 vs. 2 vs. 11\n\n\nBlood glucose\n\nSignificantly lower in Group 3: 149 vs. 156 vs. 128\n\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nAge: 68 vs. 69. vs. 67\nPrior stroke/TIA: 31% vs. 25% vs. 23%\nSystolic BP at admission: 166 vs. 163 vs. 169\nNIHSS score: 7 vs. 8 vs. 8\nStroke location\n\nAnterior circulation: 94% vs. 89% vs. 85%\n\n\nHypodensity >1/3rd MCA territory: 29% vs. 28% vs. 24%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nThree intervention arms, aiming for a systolic blood pressure target for 24 hours following study enrolment of either:\n\n140-160mmHg (median BP achieved: 153mmHg)\n161-180mmHg (median BP achieved: 163mmHg)\n181-200mmHg (median BP achieved: 178mmHg)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNo control groups\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nThe SBP was maintained according to the randomised target during the first 24 hours using one of following strategies:\n\nSBP in the target range: no specific intervention to manipulate BP\nSBP lower than the target range: intravenous (IV) 500\u20131000 ml bolus of 0.9% saline solution and if necessary followed by IV norepinephrine\nSBP higher than the target range: IV esmolol followed by nitroprusside, if necessary, to lower SBP to target level\n\n\nPatients received the standard management\u00a0for non-thrombolised AIS, including statins, antiplatelet agents (Aspirin or Clopidogrel) and enoxaparin for deep venous thrombosis prevention immediately after the first CT scan\nThe patients with cardioembolic strokes received anticoagulation for secondary prevention as soon as possible depending on the stroke size\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: No significant difference in a \u2018good outcome\u2019 (mRS score 0-2 at 90 days) between the systolic blood pressure groups\n\nGroup 1 vs. Group 2 vs. Group 3\n\n51% vs. 52% vs. 39%, p=0.27\n\n\n\n\nThe mean time from symptom onset to reach the allocated SBP target was in total 7h 6 min: 5 h from symptom onset to randomisation and 2h 6 min from the randomisation to reach the SBP stratus.\nSBP was manipulated in 176 patients (76.2%). 90 patients (39%) had their SBP increased and 86 patients (37.2%) had their SBP decreased\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nSignificantly higher incidence of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage in the highest systolic blood pressure group\n\n1% vs. 3% vs. 9%, p=0.049\n\n\nNo difference in mortality between the three groups\n\n14% vs. 19% vs. 11%, p=0.4\n\n\nOrdinal analysis of the distribution of mRS scores in the three groups showed no difference (p=0.51)\nLogistic regression analysis adjusting for age, blood glucose, baseline NIHSS score, hypodensity >1/3rd MCA territory, TOAST classification and BP manipulation \u2013 probability of a good outcome at 90 days was significantly greater for Group 2 vs. Group 3, p=0.03\n\nmRS 0-2: 51% vs. 52%, vs. 39%\n\n\nThe greatest probability of a good outcome was in patients who received no SBP manipulation when compared with SBP manipulated patients (62% vs. 44%; p=0.04)\nAll adverse effects were felt to be associated with noradrenaline use, with 1.3% and 6.0% of patients in groups 2 and 3 having acute coronary syndromes\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe results of the MAPAS trial suggests that the neurological functional outcome assessed by the mRS at 90 days was not significantly different among the three pre-specified SBP groups\nNo patient had acute neurological deterioration related to the BP reduction in 24 hours\nSpontaneous intracranial haemorrhage occurred more frequently in patients with higher SBP (181\u2013200 mmHg)\nAfter adjusting for confounders, the chance of good outcome in 90 days was greater in patients in which SBP was maintained in the 161\u2013180 mmHg range in the first 24 hours after stroke\n\nStrengths\n\nPatient-centred outcome\nOutcome assessors blinded to study group\nHaemorrhagic stroke transformation analysed in subgroup analysis\nTarget BP reached at a mean time of 2 hours and 6 minutes following randomisation\nPower calculation performed based on the functional independence expected following a thrombolysed stroke\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle-centre study limits generalisability\nSmall sample size despite four years of recruitment\nWide exclusion criteria used\nNo invasive BP monitoring used and SBP measured only every 60 minutes following the first hour\nPoor between-group separation, other than between the lowest and highest groups. A better design may have been 140-160mmHg vs. 180-200mmHg\nTarget SBP not sustained over 24 hours in around 40% of group 2 and 3 patients\n16% of patients had no functional deficit at baseline. Manipulation of blood pressure was unlikely to change functional outcome in this group\n30% of patients were excluded from thrombolysis as hypodensity on CT was too pronounced\nOpen label study design meant that physician bias may have influenced patient management\nAdjusted analysis on small numbers of patients unlikely to be meaningful data\nThe power of the study may have meant that clinically significant differences may not have been detected i.e. there was a difference of 13% between the primary outcome rate in group 2 and group 3. This difference if real, would still be clinically significant\nPatients excluded post randomisation\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study will not change my current practice of not manipulating the systolic blood pressure following acute ischaemic stroke, unless it is unacceptably low (< 120mmHg) or high (>200mmHg)\nThe results of this paper are not applicable to stroke patients who have received thrombolysis or mechanical clot retrieval therapy or who are anticoagulated\nI await future studies that use the presence or absence of ischaemic penumbra on CT perfusion imaging to guide SBP targets\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0MAPAS study\n[further reading]\u00a0Editorial\n[further reading]\u00a0RIGHT2 study commentary\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Fraser Magee @fraz65\nSummary date: 10/05/2019\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\n\n\n"
