Rate) Zampieri FG; JAMA 2021; doi:10.1001/jama.2021.11444\nClinical Questions\n\nIn adult intensive care patients does the use of a balanced crystalloid compared to 0.9% saline reduce 90-day all-cause mortality?\nIn adult intensive care patients needing administration of resuscitation fluids, does the slow infusion compared to a fast infusion of a fluid boluses reduce 90-day all-cause mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nAlmost all patients in ICU receive intravenous fluids\nThe SPLIT and SMART trials compare Plasma-Lyte and 0.9% saline\n\nThe SPLIT trial, with a median of 2000ml administered in each arm, showed no difference in 90 day AKI\nThe SMART trial, with a median of 1000ml administered in each arm, showed a significant greater 30 day occurrence of Major Adverse Kidney Events (a composite of death, new RRT or persistent renal dysfunction)\n\n\nThe use of rapid fluid boluses, a very common intervention in unwell patients, has been hypothesised to result in unfavourable cardiovascular physiological outcomes, such as reduced arterial elastance\n\nThe FEAST trial showed that in African children with hypotension the use of saline or albumin boluses resulted in an increased risk of 48-hour mortality\nThe FENICE study looking at fluid bolus administration in over 2000 ICU patients found that the practice was very variable (with regards to volume, rate, end-points)\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nFactorial 2 x 2 randomised study\n\nRandomised in 1:1:1:1 ratio to each fluid (balanced solution \u2013 Plasma-Lyte and 0.9% sodium chloride) and each rate of administration (333ml/hr and 999ml/hr)\n\n\nRandomisation via online software in random permutated blocks of 12 patients\nThose involved in patient care were blinded to fluid type but not to the rate of administration\nFluid supplied in identical 500ml bags labelled with a letter (A \u2013 F)\nData and protocol adherence checked on days 1,2,3 and 7\nFollow up phone call at day 90 to assess vital status and need for RRT\nPower Calculations:\n\nPlanned sample size 11,000\nBased on 35% 90d mortality rate in control (0.9% sodium chloride or rapid infusion)\n89% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.9 or less for 90d mortality with an alpha level of 0.05\nAbsence of interaction between fluid type and speed was assumed\n\n\nPre-specified secondary, tertiary outcomes and subgroups\nIdeally, prospective informed consent sought but deferred consent allowed\nAppropriate ethical approval gained\n\nSetting\n\n75 ICUs in Brazil\nData collected from 29th May 2017 \u2013\u00a0 2nd March 2020\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdmitted to ICU with a need for fluid resuscitation (defined by 1 sign of hypoperfusion + 1 sign of fluid responsiveness)\nNot expected to be discharged the day after admission\nAt least 1 risk factor for AKI (Age > 65 years, hypotension, sepsis, mechanical ventilation, oliguria, raised serum creatinine level, cirrhosis or acute liver failure)\n\n\nExclusion:\n\n< 18 years\nRRT, or expectation to require RRT, within 6 hours\nSevere electrolyte disturbance (Na+<120 or >160, K+>5.5)\nDeath expected within next 24 hours\nSuspected or confirmed brain death\nReceipt of palliative care treatment only\nPrior enrolment\n\n\n11,052 patients randomised\n\n486 subsequently refused consent, 46 duplicate randomisations, 25 lost to follow up at 90d\n\n5,290 randomised to receive 0.9% sodium chloride\u00a0\n\n0.9% sodium chloride at rapid infusion rate: 2,641\n0.9% sodium chloride at slower infusion rate: 2,649\n\n\n5,230 randomised to receive balanced solution\u00a0\n\nBalanced solution at rapid infusion rate: 2,603\nBalanced solution at slower infusion rate: 2,627\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nBaseline characteristics similar across all groups\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nTwo interventions were assessed:\n\nThe use of a balanced crystalloid (Plasma-Lyte)\nGiving a slower rate infusion (333ml/hr) if fluid boluses were required\n\n\n\nControl\n\nTwo controls were assessed:\n\nThe use of 0.9% Sodium Chloride\nGiving a rapid rate infusion (999ml/hr) if fluid boluses were required\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nFluid that patient randomised to was used for entire ICU stay (up to 90 days)\nGuidelines provided for when a fluid challenge is required, and when to commence RRT\nUsed for resuscitation, maintenance and drug dilution if possible\n\nIf fluid is indicated:\n\nMaintenance \u2013 given study fluid patient randomised\nFluid bolus \u2013 given study fluid at the rate patient randomised\nOther fluid (bicarbonate, albumin, blood etc) \u2013 allowed\n\n\n\n\nVolumes and frequency of administration at discretion of treating clinicians\nIn some scenarios (e.g. severe hypernatraemia), study fluid not allowed so can use alternate fluid\n\nUse of study fluid was to resume as soon as contraindication resolved\n\n\n\nOutcomes\nFluid Type: Sodium Chloride vs. Balanced Solutions\n\nPrimary outcome: No significant difference in 90-day mortality\n\n1381 of 5230 patients (26.4%) assigned to a balanced solution died vs 1439 of 5290 patients (27.2%) assigned to saline solution (adjusted HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.90-1.05]; P\u2009=\u2009.47)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: SOFA score at day 7 was significantly different for the balanced solution group\n\nmedian difference, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.08-0.45]), mostly due to a higher neurological SOFA score (>2) at day 7 (32.1% vs 26.0% for the saline solution group; odds ratio, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.18-1.66])\nThere was no statistical difference in the other 17 secondary outcomes including incidence of AKI with need for RRT within 90 days per 1000 patient days\n\n\nSub-group analyses: statistically significant interaction between presence of traumatic brain injury, fluid type, and 90-day mortality\n\n31.3% for the balanced solution group vs 21.1% for the saline solution group [HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.03-2.12]\n26.2% vs 27.5% for patients without a traumatic brain injury\n\n\n\n\nFluid Rate: Rapid vs. Slow administration of fluid challenges\n\nPrimary outcome: No significant difference in 90-day mortality\n\nIn the slower infusion group, 1406 of 5276 patients (26.6%) had died by day 90 compared with 1414 of 5244 patients (27.0%) in the control group\n\nHR 1.03 [95% CI 0.96 \u2013 1.11], p = 0.46\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: differences in Day 3 cardiovascular, respiratory and coagulation SOFA scores significant. By Day 7 no differences in SOFA scores significant.\n\nDay 3 cardiovascular SOFA scores lower in slower group, 32.5 vs. 35.3\n\nOR 0.89 [95% CI 0.80 \u2013 0.98]\n\n\nDay 3 respiratory SOFA score lower in slower group, 6.2 vs. 7.5\n\nOR 0.81 [95% CI 0.68 \u2013 0.97]\n\n\nDay 3 coagulation SOFA score higher in slower group, 4.7 vs. 3.9\n\nOR 1.31 [95% CI 1.05 \u2013 1.64]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong patients in intensive care:\n\nThe use of a balanced crystalloid compared to 0.9% sodium chloride did not reduce 90-day mortality\nThe use of slower infusion rates when a fluid bolus is required compared to a faster rate of infusion did not reduce 90-day mortality\n\n\n\nStrengths\n\nAn extremely large, multi-centre trial designed to answer an important clinical question given the frequency of fluid use in ICU\nExcellent internal validity\n\nGood randomisation strategy. This strategy was tested at end when principal investigators were asked if they could guess which fluid each letter corresponded too\n\n6/66 who replied, correctly guessed the association between all letters and fluid type (this was compatible with hypothesis that the answers guess were random)\n\n\nAppropriate blinding for fluid type (not blinded for rate)\nMinimal loss to follow-up: 0.2% (25/11052)\nBalanced baseline characteristics\nPre-printed statistical analysis plan\n\n\nSensible secondary outcomes and pre-specified subgroups\n\nThe authors rightly identify these being as hypothesis generating only\n\n\nTo complete, process and write up such a large and methodologically rigorous RCT whilst in the midst of Brazil\u2019s COVID-19 situation is impressive\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNot analysed as intention to treat\n\nGiven that majority (~87%) of those who did not receive treatment as randomised was due to withdrawal of consent, this is unlikely to be clinically relevant\n\n\nMortality lower than anticipated in power calculations (~27% vs. 35%)\n\nMay reduce power of study to detect important differences\n\n\nMostly lower acuity ICU patients (median APACHE II score 12 and SOFA 4) with nearly 50% elective surgical and 40% of patients not hypotensive\nMedian volumes of trial fluid administered were low (mean <1 L/day) making a difference in outcomes potentially less likely to be detected\n\n24 hours study fluid: 1.5L in each group\n72 hours total study fluid: 2.9L in each group\n72 hours total fluid (study and non study fluid): 4.1L (SD 2.9L)\n\n\nThe administration of non-study fluids could confound results:\n\n68% of all patients received fluid prior to randomisation (~32% in the 0.9% sodium chloride received >1L balanced fluid and ~18% in the balanced group received >1L 0.9% sodium chloride).\nFollowing randomisation ~30% of the total fluid received by day 3 was non-study crystalloid (eTable 2, Supplement 3)\nAdditionally, dextrose, albumin and synthetic colloids were also transfused\n\n\nChloride load hypothesised to be reason for increased mortality and organ failure. Whilst mean serum chloride levels were higher in 0.9% sodium chloride group at 48 hour (108 mEq/L vs. ~105.5 mEq/L), this was only 2 mEq/L above the upper limit of normal range which is not a meaningful clinical important difference\nThe slower infusion rate was defined arbitrarily at 333 mL/hr. The authors provide explanation that as this is less than 25% percentile in the Fluid Challenges in Intensive Care (FENICE) cohort study (500 mL/h) it still represented a value that was considered as a bolus (and not maintenance) by clinicians\nNo data collected on reason for administration of fluid bolus or immediate haemodynamic effects\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nOn the basis of this trial, the use of 0.9% sodium chloride in ICU appears safe\nGiven some of the limitations above, and conflicting data from other trials, I will continue to use balanced crystalloid for those patients who are acutely unwell with an unplanned ICU admission\n\nAlthough the secondary outcomes are hypothesis generating, it would seem reasonable to use 0.9% saline in TBI patients\n\n\nThe need for (rapidly administered) fluid boluses for intensive care patients should be evaluated on an individual patient basis, rather than be a reflexive action given lack of benefit and potential harm shown\nThe PLUS trial will continue to inform practice\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Paper] Effect of Intravenous Fluid Treatment With a Balanced Solution vs 0.9% Saline Solution on Mortality in Critically Ill Patients.
