First published online 22 Jul 2015. DOI: 10.1164/rccm.201505-0857OC\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult ICU patients on beta-lactam antibiotics, does continuous infusion compared to intermittent bolus increase survival?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\nDouble-blind with double-dummy preparations\n\nUnblinded staff prepared drugs and consecutively labelled sealed opaque envelopes\nStudy participants, clinicians and data investigators remained blinded\n\n\nPilot trial conducted to guide power calculation\n\nSample size of 420 required to achieve 90% power to detect a 3 day difference in the primary outcome\n\n\nIntention-to-treat (ITT) analysis for primary end points, in addition to:\n\nModified intention-to-treat (mITT) conducted in eligible patients who received a study drug\nA priori per protocol analysis in those who received 3 or more days of a study drug\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n25 Intensive Care Units (17 in Australia, 7 in New Zealand and 1 in Hong Kong)\nJuly 2012 to April 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: adults with severe sepsis commenced on any of:\n\nPiperacillin-tazobactam\nTicarcillin-clavulanate\nMeropenem\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nReceived beta-lactam for more than 24 hours duration prior to randomisation\nPregnancy\nAllergy to study drugs\nNo central venous line with >= 3 lumens\nPalliative treatment only, limits to care, death is imminent or death is likely within 90 days due to underlying process\n\n\n2630 patients screened, 432 eligible patients were randomised (ITT), 422 received a study drug (mITT)\n\nPathogen isolated in blood cultures in 83 patients\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nContinuous infusion of beta-lactam antibiotics\n\nLoading dose of chosen antibiotic\nContinuous infusion thereafter\n\n1g in 100ml Meropenem over 24 hours\n13.5g in 250ml Piperacillin-tazobactam over 24 hours\n12.4g in 250ml Ticarcillin-clavulanate over 24 hours\n\n\nAdministered with a normal saline dummy intermittent infusion\n\n\n\nControl\n\nIntermittent infusion of beta-lactam antibiotics\n\nLoading dose of chosen antibiotic\nIntermittent infusion thereafter\n\n1g in 20ml\u00a0Meropenem once daily\n4.5g in 20ml Piperacillin-tazobactam three times daily\n3.1g in 20ml Ticarcillin-clavulanate four times daily\n\n\nAdministered with a normal saline dummy continuous infusion\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nInfusions were administered via a primed central venous line\nA change between the three beta-lactam antibiotics or to flucloxacillin was permitted within 14 days\n\nIf flucloxacillin was introduced, a non-blinded loading dose was administered followed by blinded administration as per the patient\u2019s allocation\n\n\nTotal dose over 24 hours was the same regardless of group allocation\n\nOutcome\n\nCharacteristics of the groups (continuous vs intermittent)\n\nAPACHE II score: 21 [IQR 17-26] vs 20 [IQR 16-25]\nMedian antibiotic administration prior to randomisation: 13 hours vs 12 hours\nMedian duration of blinded study drug treatment: 3.2 days [IQR 1.9-6.0] vs 3.7 days [IQR 1.9-5.9]\nMedian total course of beta-lactam antibiotic: 5.3 days [IQR 2.9-7.7] vs 5.0 days [IQR 3.1-8.0]\nChange in antibiotic: 9.4% patients vs 11.8% patients\nChoice of antibiotic:\n\nPiperacillin-tazobactam: 69.3% vs 71.4%\nMeropenem: 29.7% vs 27.3%\nTicarcillin-clavulanate: 0.9% vs 1.4%\n\n\n\n\nPrimary outcome: no difference was demonstrated in alive ICU-free days at 28 days\n\nContinuous group: 18 days [IQR 2-24]\nIntermittent: 20 days [IQR 3-24]\nP-value: 0.38\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nICU-free days at 90 days: no difference found\n\nHazard ratio: 0.91 (95% CI 0.63-1.31; p-value = 0.61)\n\n\nClinical cure at 14 days after antibiotic cessation: no difference found\n\nOdds ratio: 1.12 (95% CI 0.77-1.63; p-value 0.56)\n\n\n\n\nModified Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis\n\nDifferences remained non-significant for these two a priori defined populations\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn a heterogenous Intensive Care Unit population, continuous and intermittent infusion of beta-lactams appear to have equivalent outcomes\n\nStrengths\n\nInclusion of a pragmatic, heterogenous ICU population including those on renal replacement therapy\nAppropriate randomisation, concealment and blinding\nDouble-blind and double-dummy administration removes possible bias, which is particularly important given that the treating clinicians could influence the outcome measure (early or late discharge from ICU)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNot powered to detect mortality differences; this study used alive ICU-free days at 28 days as a surrogate\nRelatively short antibiotic courses were used, and so may not represent all ICU practice\nVery few patients received ticarcillin-clavulanate, so the results may not be representative for this antibiotic\nClinical cure was assessed subjectively by blinded clinician\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn ICU patients, with underlying pathophysiological changes of sepsis and organ dysfunction, there appears to be no benefit from continuous infusion of beta-lactam antibiotics compared to intermittent bolus infusion\nGiven the simplicity of an intermittent bolus infusion, this should be the preferred method for these antibiotics in this patient group\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0A multicenter randomized trial of continuous versus intermittent beta-lactam infusions in severe sepsis\n[further reading]\u00a0Alternative dosing strategies for intravenous antibiotics to treat severe infections\n[further reading]\u00a0LITFL CCC \u2013 Antimicrobial dosing and kill characteristics\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 2 October 2015\nPeer-review editor: @avkwong\n\n\n"
