DOI\u00a010.1056/NEJMoa2202884\nClinical Question\n\nIn adults with acute pancreatitis does aggressive fluid resuscitation compared to moderate resuscitation result in a reduction in the development of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis?\n\nBackground\n\n\u00a0Acute Pancreatitis (AP) has a high associated mortality and morbidity\nRates of ICU admission with AP and associated multiorgan dysfunction have been reported to be as high as 25%, with up to 20% of these patients dying\nEmerging evidence suggests that across multiple pathologies a conservative fluid strategy is not harmful\nDespite limited high quality evidence and suggestion of harm in a systematic review and meta analysis the practice of aggressive fluid resuscitation is widely carried out\nThe WATERFALL study was carried out to try and provide some high quality evidence to address this practice and its potential harms\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, open-label, parallel-group, randomized, controlled, superiority trial\n\nUnblinded to both patients and investigators\n\n\nPatients enrolled from those presenting to ED < 24 hours from pain onset and < 8 hours from diagnosis\nRegular physical and biochemical assessments at 3,12, 24,48 and 72 hours conducted\n\nClinicians were able to provide further fluid boluses, cease fluid or change rate based on certain goal directed points at these time points\n\n\nComputer based central randomization\n\nStratified by centre, presence of SIRS and presence of hypovolaemia\n1:1 ratio\n\n\nIndependent DSMB consisting of clinical pharmacist, cardiologist and gastroenterologist\n\n3 a-priori stopping rules were: (1) p values showing no difference at first and second interim analyses (< 0.0002 and then < 0.012 respectively), (2) clear harm demonstrated in one group and (3) a slow recruitment rate\n\n\nPower calculation:\n\n744 patients required (alpha 0.05, 80% power) to detect a 10% point difference in development of moderately severe or severe AP from 35 to 25%\nIncidence of 35% based on Spanish multi-centre cohort study\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n18 centres in 4 countries (Spain, India, Italy, Mexico)\nMay 2020 to September 2021\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n> 18 years old\nAP as defined by Revised Atlanta Criteria (2 or more of: typical abdominal pain, lipase or amylase 3x ULN or imaging evidence of AP)\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nThose with moderately severe or severe AP at baseline (shock, respiratory failure, and renal failure)\nCardiac Failure: NYHA II to IV\nElectrolyte abnormalities (Na < 135, > 145; K > 5)\nChronic pancreatitis\nChronic renal failure\nDecompensated chronic liver disease\nSevere comorbidity with life expectancy < 1 year\n\n\n676 assessed \u2014> 249 randomized\n\n122 to aggressive group\n127 to moderate group\nAll those not randomized due to exclusion criteria or not providing consent\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nAge: 56 vs 57\nFemale: 55.7\u00a0vs 46.5%\nGallstone AP: 65.6 vs 55.9%\nSIRS: 28.7% vs 22.8%\nHypovolaemia: 52.5% vs 51.2%\nMedian Urea: 32 vs 36 mg/dL\nMedian Creatinine: 0.8 vs 0.8 mg/dL\nMedian BISAP: 1 vs 1\nMedian PAN-PROMISE: 31 vs 27\nCharlson Co-morbidity score: 2 vs 2\n\n\nCumulative median volumes (L) of lactated ringers administered (Table S3)\n\nAggressive vs Moderate\n12 hrs: 3.4 vs 1.5\n24 hrs: 5.4 vs 3.3\n48 hrs: 7.8 vs 5.5\n\n\n\nAggressive Fluid Regime\n\n20 ml/kg bonus then 3ml/kg infusion for 48 hours if oral feeding tolerated for > 8 hours\nFurther 20ml/kg bolus allowed if UO < 0.5 mls/kg/hr or SBP < 90 mmHg during assessments at 12-72 hours\n\nModerate Fluid Resuscitation\n\n10 ml/kg bolus only if hypovolaemic followed by infusion 1.5 ml/kg/hr for 20 hours if oral intake tolerated for > 8 hours\nFurther 10 ml/kg boluses allowed as per intervention group above\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nLactated Ringers was fluid used\nFluid rate able to be reduced or stopped if evidence of overload\nClear definitions of volume state provided\nOral feeding at 12 hours if PAN-PROMISE < 5\n\nOutcome\n\nStudy was stopped by DSMB as significantly worse results with respect to safety outcomes in the aggressive-resuscitation group, which were not balanced by any trend toward improved outcomes\nPrimary outcome:\u00a0occurrence of Moderately Severe or Severe AP\n\n22.1 % (aggressive) vs 17.3% (moderate)\nRR 1.28 (95% CI 0.77 \u2013 2.12)\n\n\nSecondary and safety outcomes:\nComparing aggressive fluid resuscitation vs. moderate fluid resuscitation\n\nNo significant difference (although all trend towards favouring moderate resuscitation) in:\n\nSevere pancreatitis\nLocal Complications\nICU admission\nPersistent Organ Failure\nPersistent SIRS\nDeath\n\n\nSignificantly greater in aggressive group\n\nFluid overload\n\n\n\n\nNo difference from overall analysis in pre-specified subgroups (baseline SIRS and hypovolaemia)\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn AP, aggressive fluid resuscitation as compared with moderate fluid resuscitation for the treatment of acute pancreatitis, led to a higher risk of volume overload and did not show benefit in disease-specific outcomes\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomized, multi-centre\nNo loss to follow up\nIntention to treat analysis\nRelatively balanced baseline characteristics\nClear protocol for fluid administration and pre-specified definitions standardises outcome assessment and improves internal validity\n\nThe removal of clinical signs that could have significant inter-observer variability further improves reproducibility (e.g. third and fourth heart sounds and pleural effusions on CXR)\n\n\nExcellent focus on safety outcomes given potential harm shown by high volume fluid administration\n\nWeaknesses\n\n86% of patients were from Spain\nUnblinded\nGiven trend towards benefit of moderate fluid resuscitation with respect to the primary outcome, early cessation may have prevented study reaching a significant threshold\nFairly significant exclusion criteria \u2013 the patients randomised have mild pancreatitis without significant co-morbidity (low Charlson Co-morbidity scores in each group)\nUncertain if fluids prior to randomization or if any other fluids aside from Lactated Ringer\u2019s were included in fluid totals administered\nPatient safety is always a priority but 20% in aggressive group compared to 8% in moderate group discontinued intervention (Figure S1) \u2013 this may bias results towards null\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAlthough this study excludes those patients with anything other than mild AP, this cohort of patients may still be seen on the ward by critical care teams. This trial provides robust evidence that high volumes of fluid administration lead to fluid overload\nThis didn\u2019t have significant clinical sequelae in this trial (intubation, RRT, death), however positive fluid balances have been associated with worse morbidity and mortality in the critically ill so is still an important factor we should consider\n\nExternal Links\n\nAggressive or Moderate Fluid Resuscitation in Acute Pancreatitis\nEditorial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker @hgmwalker89\nSummary date: 20th September 2022\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\nPicture by: Pexels / Rifqi Ramadhan\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
