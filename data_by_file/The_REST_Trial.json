JAMA August 31, 2021; doi:10.1001/jama.2021.13374\nClinical Question\n\nIn mechanically ventilated patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, does lowering tidal volume using extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal, compared with conventional low tidal volume ventilation, improve day 90 all-cause mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nHypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation is common in the ICU, and is associated with high morbidity, mortality and health care costs\nStudies of ARDS have shown that strategies that reduce tidal volumes cause a reduction in ventilator induced lung injury and improve patient outcomes\nCurrent international guidelines recommend protective lung ventilation strategies which include targeting tidal volumes (Vt) \u22646mls/kg PBW and plateau pressures (Ppl) of <30cmH20\nHowever, protective lung ventilation is associated with respiratory acidosis and other interventions which may adversely impact patient care and outcomes\nExtracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECOR) is an extracorporeal device that removes CO2 from the blood via an external membrane and circuit (but unlike ECMO is not able to add oxygen in sufficient amounts)\nSeveral studies have shown that it is feasible to use ECOR to remove significant amounts of CO2 to facilitate very low tidal volume mechanical ventilation strategies (SUPERNOVA 2019, XTRAVENT 2013)\nHowever to date there have been no large studies that assess ECOR with patient centred outcomes\n\nDesign\n\nPragmatic, multi centre, open label, randomized controlled clinical trial\n1:1 randomisation, using a computer-generated schedule with variable block sizes stratified by recruitment centre\nAll sites were given an education package to standardise ECOR and trial processes\nPrimary statistical analysis using an intention to treat chi squared analysis, and a secondary analysis using log binomial regression adjusted for age, SOFA score and baseline PaO2/FiO2\nPower calculation: 1120 patients provided a 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 9% in 90 day mortality, assuming a mortality rate of 41%\n\nRationale was based on a 9% ARR that occurred in the ARDSNet trial which randomised patients tidal volumes to either 12 or 6ml/Kg PBW\n\n\nOriginal plan was for an interim analysis at 560 patients, however this was moved forwards to 412 patients after the trial was paused to investigate an intracranial haemorrhage in the intervention arm\n\nAt this time point, the DSMB performed a conditional power analysis and found that ongoing recruitment was unlikely to show benefit\nThere were no stopping rules, but the analysis suggested only a 44% chance of finding a difference between groups, therefore they recommended stopping the trial for feasibility and futility reasons\nOf note, it was not stopped specifically due to safety concerns\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n51 adult general ICUs within the NHS in the UK\nRecruitment from May 2016 to December 2019\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdult patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation\nPotentially reversible cause of acute hypoxic respiratory failure\n<48 hours since onset of hypoxaemia\nModerate to severe respiratory failure with PaO2:FiO2 ratio of <150mmHg with\u00a0\u22655cmH20 PEEP\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nMechanical ventilation >7 days\nClinicians able to reduce tidal volumes \u22643mL/kg\nAny contraindication to systemic anticoagulation with heparin\nUntreated pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion or pneumothorax\nAcute respiratory failure fully explained by LVF or fluid overload\n\n\nScreening\n\n7071 patients screened, 412 (6%) were recruited into the study\n\nThe two most common reasons for exclusion were:\n\n\u201cOther\u201d (26%) which included any reason not listed in the protocol, most commonly this was rapid change in clinical state (improvement or deterioration)\nCI to anticoagulation (21%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncluded population\u00a0\nGenerally good balance of baseline variables with minor differences that would not have impacted the primary outcome (ECOR vs standard care)\n\nMedian age:\u00a0 60.2 vs 61.8 years old\nARDS at baseline:\u00a0 59% vs 63%\nAPACHE II: 19 vs 20\nSOFA: 10 vs 10\nPF ratio: 118 vs 115 mmHg\nDriving pressure: 15 vs 16 cm H2O\nMedian Vt: 6.3 vs. 6.4 ml/kg PBW\nPEEP: 10 vs 10 cm H2O\nPaCO2: 53.8 vs 54.6 mmHg\npH: 7.3 vs 7.3\nProne positioning: 11% vs 11%\nNeuromuscular blocking drugs: 51% vs 49%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nA dual lumen catheter was percutaneously inserted into the patient\nCommencement of ECOR and initiation with systemic heparin anticoagulation\nBlood flow was maximised (typically 350-450mL/min) and sweep gas removal was turned up to 10Lmin\nMechanical ventilator was adjusted to target tidal volumes of 3ml/kg predicted body weight\nECOR was continued for \u226548 hours, then weaned according to the trial protocol\n\nMaximum duration of ECOR use was 7 days\n\n\nDose of intervention\n\n185/202 actually received ECOR, for a mean duration of 4 (+/- 2) days\nReasons for cessation of ECOR:\n\n7 days post randomisation in 18%, safety concerns in 8%, and\u00a0 requirement for ECMO in 7%\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nGuideline based mechanical ventilation, including targeting 6ml/Kg predicted body weight and PEEP based on ARDSNet tables\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nPatients in both groups could receive neuromuscular-blocking drugs, prone positioning, or referral for consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), as per UK guidelines\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome\nNo difference in primary outcome of day 90 all cause mortality\n\n41.5% in the lower tidal volume ventilation with extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal group vs 39.5% in the standard care group\n\nRisk Ratio, 1.05 [95% CI,0.83-1.33]; difference, 2.0% [95% CI, \u22127.6% to 11.5%]; p = .68)\n\n\nThis was unchanged after adjusting for age, SOFA score and baseline PaO2/Fio2, and unchanged after looking at per protocol analysis, and after excluding the first 2 patients initiated on ECOR at each site.\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nComparing ECOR vs. standard care group:\n\nLower tidal volumes on day 2-3\n\nDay 2: 4.5 mls/kg PBW vs 6.5mls/kg PBW\n\nmean difference -2.0 [95% CI -2.3 \u2013 -1.7]\n\n\nDay 3: 4.4mls/kg PBW vs 6.7 mls/kg PBW\n\nmean difference

related to the intervention and 3 which resulted in death\n\n\n\n\nHigher rates of infectious complications (7 vs 1)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients requiring mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, lower tidal volume ventilation facilitated by extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal, compared with standard care, did not result in a reduction in mortality at 90 days. However, due to early termination, the study may have been underpowered to detect a clinically important difference\n\nStrengths\n\nLarge, multicentre, RCT led by an experienced clinical trials group\nImportant clinical question with potentially large financial implications for critical care around the world\nReasonable attempts to reduce bias (central randomisation, allocation concealment, unbiased primary outcome, pre-published protocol and statistical analysis plan)\nGood baseline balance suggesting effective randomisation\nGood adherence to the ECOR intervention (92% received it)\nNo industry funding\nMinimal missing data (1.7% missing data from primary outcome)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAlthough the inclusion criteria were broad, only 6% of all those screened were entered into the study \u2013 suggesting a significant selection bias and lack of generalisability to other populations\nAlthough there was good group separation of tidal volume across days 2-7, the dose of the intervention fell short of the 3ml/kg target\n\nIn addition, many other clinically important \u00a0variables were not separated e.g. plateau pressure, respiratory rate and CO2 level\n\n\nBoth arms had low rates of proning (11%), not representing contemporary standard care, although the mortality rate in the control arm accurately reflected current UK mortality (41%)\nPatients, clinicians and researchers were not blinded resulting in moderate risk of performance bias\n\nUse of an unbiased primary endpoint of mortality reduces this risk\n\n\nThe trial was stopped early due to futility and feasibility issues, contributed to by:\n\na\u00a0lower than expected recruitment rate\nthe requirement of a very large (?realistic) reduction in mortality as set out in the power calculation (ARR 9%)\n\n\nTherefore, the trial as it stands was underpowered and could have missed a true difference (the point estimate favoured the control arm)\nMany sites had little experience of ECOR prior to the trial, despite there being a known volume outcome relationship with the use of ECLS\n\nHowever the sensitivity analysis which excluded the first 2 patients from sites did not demonstrate a significant learning curve\nOnly 4/51 sites had > 10 patients with ECOR in the trial\n\n\nThe study investigated a complex bundle of interventions, including the effects of ECOR, anticoagulation AND a target of 3ml/kg. Targeting such a low tidal volume resulted in a lower pH and higher CO2 levels in the intervention arm, and additional interventions such as more mandatory mechanical ventilation, more NMB and a higher respiratory rate. Separating out and interpreting each component of the trial is therefore challenging\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe data presented in this study suggest that while achieving lower tidal volumes using ECOR was possible, any potential benefit on the lung was offset by the increased requirement of mandatory mechanical ventilation and NMB, and adverse events including serious complications such as intracranial haemorrhage\nGiven the safety concerns outlined above, the strategy outlined in this study should not be used in patients outside further clinical trials\nFuture studies that harness the potential benefits of ECOR without increasing the risk of other complications are needed to progress this technology\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] The REST trial\n[further reading] Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure\n[further reading] The REST Trial.
