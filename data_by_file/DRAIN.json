Clinical Research in Cardiology 2019; Published online 29 June 2019. doi:10.1007/s00392-019-01521-y\nClinical Question\n\nIn adults with decompensated heart failure who are at high-risk of diuretic resistance, does furosemide administered by infusion compared to intermittent bolus increase the incidence of freedom from congestion at 72 hours?\n\nBackground\n\nDiuretic resistance is a common issue in patients with acute decompensation of advanced chronic heart failure (ACHF)\nControversies exist about the best modality of furosemide administration\nThe largest prospective double-blind randomized trial (DOSE study) comparing continuous infusion and intermittent boluses in acute decompensated heart failure demonstrated no significant differences in global assessment of symptoms or in the mean change in the creatinine level\nA recent meta-analysis found continuous infusion superior to boluses administration in terms of weight reduction, total urine output, and brain natriuretic peptide reduction\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\nComputer generated randomisation sequence with 1:1 ratio\nAllocation was concealed by using sequential numbered cases with pre-prepared drug and dummy placebo\nDouble blind, double dummy design\n\nBoth groups received infusion and bolus, with one being active diuretic and the other being 5% dextrose\n\n\nTwo different doses of furosemide were given depending upon patient characteristics\n\nThis was defined prior to randomisation\nThis dose was then given by the randomly allocated method\n\n\nDesigned to assess superiority of continuous infusion over intermittent bolus therapy\nSample size of 78 patients required\n\nPowered at 70% (False positive rate 30%)\nSignificance level 10% (False negative rate 10%)\nExpected absolute difference of 23% (NNT 5)\n\nEstimated outcome in bolus group 48%\nEstimated outcome in infusion group 25%\n\n\n\n\nPrespecified subgroups (renal function, haemodynamic profile and diuretic dose) was analysed with Bonferroni correction\n\nSetting\n\nIntensive Cardiac Care Unit of University Hospital in Turin\nMay 2013 to December 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: adults over 18 years with advanced chronic heart failure; ejection fraction < 30%; all of the following risk factors for diuretic resistance:\n\nSystolic BP < 110 mmHg\nSerum sodium < 135 mmol/L\nSevere congestion (wet score > 12/18)\n\n\nExclusion: Reversible cause of acute heart failure (e.g. acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, pulmonary embolism, valve disease, arrhythmias); cardiogenic shock (INTERMACS class < 2); eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2\n217 screened; 80 randomised\nBaseline characteristics were similar between groups (Intermittent Bolus vs Continuous Infusion):\n\nAge: 58.7 vs 63 years\nMale: 88% vs 93%\nEjection Fraction: 19.2% vs 19.4%\nFurosemide daily dose pre-randomisation: 242 mg vs 198 mg\nProportion that received high-dose furosemide in trial: 80% vs 63%\n\nP = 0.14 so not sufficiently different to be considered significant\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nContinuous Infusion of Furosemide\n\nThe assigned dose of furosemide was given by continuous infusion\nA dummy administration of 5% glucose placebo solution was given by intermittent bolus every 12 hours\nTreatment continued for 72 hours, after which \u2018open label\u2019 treatment was given at the clinician\u2019s discretion\n\n\n\nControl\n\nIntermittent Bolus of Furosemide\n\nThe assigned dose of furosemide was given by intermittent bolus every 12 hours\nA dummy administration of 5% glucose placebo solution was given by continuous infusion\nTreatment continued for 72 hours, after which \u2018open label\u2019 treatment was given at the clinician\u2019s discretion\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nPatients were given \u2018low dose\u2019 (120 mg/day) unless the following criteria were met, in which case they received \u2018high dose\u2019 (240 mg/day) furosemide:\n\nSevere systemic congestion (wet score > 14/18)\nPre-hospital furosemide dose of > 125 mg\nSupplemental metolazone therapy\n\n\nFurosemide 40 mg or 60 mg was given in the Emergency Department\nMaximum time from admission to diuretic treatment was 2 hours\nTreatment was protocolised\n\nIf Systolic BP > 90 mmHg, sodium nitroprusside (vasodilator) was infused and titrated\nIf hypoperfused state (cold shock), dopamine or dobutamine were infused and titrated\n\nIf high doses were required and shock progressively evolved, vasopressors were started and the patient left the study protocol\n\n\nThiazide diuretics were not allowed\nFluid restriction of 1000 ml/day\nStrict bed rest\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: freedom from congestion at 72 hours (defined as JVP < 8 cm, and no orthopnoea and with little or no peripheral oedema) occurred more frequently in the Continuous Infusion group\n\nContinuous Infusion group: 47.5%\nIntermittent Bolus group: 25%\nAbsolute Risk Reduction: 22.5% (95% CI 2.02% to 42.98%; P = 0.036)\nNumber Needed to Treat: 5 patients\nFragility Index: ZERO\n\nP = 0.619 when analysed with Fisher\u2019s exact test\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nTotal urine output was greater in the continuous infusion group\nTreatment failure occurred less often in the continuous infusion group\nDiuretic response was greater (as defined by kg weight loss per 40 mg furosemide) in the continuous infusion group\nWorsening renal function was not different\nWorsening heart failure was not significantly different\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nWhen administered to adult patients with advanced chronic heart failure and a high risk of diuretic resistance, furosemide administered by continuous infusion achieved better decongestion than furosemide administered by intermittent bolus\n\nStrengths\n\nAppropriate methodology to test well-defined hypothesis\nAppropriate concealment of random allocation sequence\nExcellent double-dummy strategy to maintain blinding of allocation throughout treatment period\nWell-defined patient population\nConsecutive screening of all admitted patients to avoid selection bias\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPower / sample size calculation does not make sense\n\nThe authors describe a decrease in the primary outcome from 48% in the control group to 25% in the intervention group\nThis would be a good thing if the primary outcome was a negative event\nIn this trial, the primary outcome was a positive event (freedom from congestion) so the hypothesis is that the intervention group will have a higher incidence of the primary outcome than the control group\n\n\nPower / sample size calculation is of\u00a0concern\n\nUsually the control group and intervention group event rates are estimated from prior data\nThese estimates are combined with defined Power and significance levels to calculate a necessary sample size\nIn this trial, the event rates used in the sample size calculations are exactly the same as the primary outcome results of this trial\nHas the power calculation been performed after the trial to establish the effective power having recruited an arbitrary number of patients?\n\n\nPower / sample size calculation has not defined Power and significance levels that are generally acceptable in clinical trials\n\nUsually Power is defined as 80% or 90%, but in this trial they have defined it as 70%, which increases the potential for Type 2 error (failing to reject the null hypothesis when there is a true effect)\nUsually significance is defined as 0.05, but in this trial they have defined it as 0.10, which increases the potential for Type 1 error (rejecting the null hypothesis when there is not a true effect)\nIn summary, this trial has a sample size too small to have sufficient power or statistical significance to adequately test the hypothesis, by usual clinical trial standards\n\n\nImbalance in furosemide dosing between groups\n\nAlthough this difference was not statistically significant, it may have been relevant\nThe dosage was higher in the intermittent bolus group, which may have biased in favour of the null hypothesis, so this may have reduced the measured effect\n\n\nFragility Index is zero\n\nWhen using Fisher\u2019s exact test instead of Chi Squared test, the trial result is no longer statistically significant by the threshold the authors defined\n\n\nSingle centre design reduces generalisability\nPredominantly male population may reduce generalisability to females\nTightly defined homogenous population reduces the generalisability to patients with less severe heart failure, those without features suggestive of diuretic resistance and critically ill patients with iatrogenic oedema\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis small and under-powered trial did demonstrate a benefit from continuous infusion of furosemide compared to intermittent boluses in a highly defined subset of patients with advanced chronic heart failure\nI will continue to administer furosemide by continuous infusion in my critically ill patients, and unfortunately this trial fails to add any evidence to support or refute this clinical practice\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Diuretic treatment in high-risk acute decompensation of advanced chronic heart failure \u2013 bolus intermittent vs continuous infusion of furosemide\n[further reading] Diuretic Strategies in Patients with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure\n[further reading] Continuous versus intermittent administration of furosemide in acute decompensated heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Duncan Chambler\nSummary date: 2 August 2019\nPeer-review editor: Steve Mathieu\n\n\n"
