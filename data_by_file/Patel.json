JAMA 2016; 315(22): 2435-41.\u00a0doi:10.1001/jama.2016.6338\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), does the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) delivered by helmet compared to NIV delivered by face mask reduce the need for intubation?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n\nSealed envelope-based randomisation\nComputer-generated, permuted block randomisation\n\n\nClinicians and patients non-blinded\nDecision to intubate made by primary care team based on predetermined criteria\nConsecutive patients\nIntention to treat analysis\nStandardised NIV and invasive ventilation protocols\nPlanned for enrolment of 206 patients (80% power to detect a 20% absolute reduction in the rate of intubation with a 2-sided \u03b1 level of 0.05), but stopped for efficacy at first interim analysis\n\nSetting\n\nSingle Medical Intensive Care Unit in a University Hospital, USA\nSep 2012 \u2013 Sep 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nAdult patients\nARDS as defined by the Berlin criteria\nRequiring NIV for at least 8 hours\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nImpending cardiac arrest\nGlasgow coma score <8\nAbsence of airway protective reflexes\nElevated intracranial pressure\nTracheostomy or upper airway obstruction\nPregnant\nHad refused endotracheal intubation\n\n\n83 patients randomised\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention\u00a0 vs. control group\n\nAge (median): 58 vs. 61\nBMI (median): 27 vs. 28\nSolid cancer: 11% vs. 26%\nStem cell transplant: 11% vs. 3%\nPneumonia: 86% vs. 72%\nPaO2:Fio2 ratio: 118 vs. 144\nOn vasopressors: 2% vs. 10%\n\nIntervention\n\nNIV delivered by helmet\n\nLatex-free helmet (Sea Long)\nNIV via ICU ventilator (Engstr\u00f6m Carestation, GE Healthcare)\nVentilator inspiratory flow rate maintained at >100 l/min to prevent CO2 rebreathing\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNIV delivered by face mask\n\nNIV via non-invasive ventilator\u00a0(Phillips Respironics V60)\n\n\n\nIn both intervention and control groups:\n\nPEEP titrated to achieve SpO2 >90% with FiO2 \u22640.6\nInspiratory pressure titrated to respiratory rate <25/min and loss of accessory muscle use\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\u00a0Proportion of patients requiring intubation \u2013 significantly lower in helmet group\n\n18.2% vs. 61.5%, p<0.001\n\nNumber needed to treat 3\nFragility index of 10 patients\nAbsolute difference 43.3% (95% C.I. -62.4 to -24.3)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\n28-day invasive ventilator-free days \u2013 significantly higher in helmet group\n\n28 vs. 12.5 days, p<0.001\nAbsolute difference 8.4% (95% C.I. 13.4 to 3.4)\n\n\nICU length of stay \u2013 significantly shorter in helmet group\n\n4.7 vs. 7.8 days, p=0.04\nAbsolute difference -2.76 days (95% C.I. -6.07 to 0.54)\n\n\nHospital length of stay \u2013 no significant difference\n\n10.1 vs. 15.2 days, p=0.16\nAbsolute difference\u00a0\u22122.92 days (95% C.I. \u22128.47 to 2.63)\n\n\nHospital mortality \u2013 significantly lower in helmet group\n\n27.3% vs. 48.7%, p=0.04\nAbsolute difference\u00a0\u221221.4% (95% C.I.\u221241.9 to \u22121.0)\n\n\n90-day mortality \u2013 significantly lower in helmet group\n\n34.1% vs. 56.4%, p=0.02\nAbsolute difference\u00a0\u221222.3% (95% C.I. \u221243.3 to \u22121.4)\n\n\nMask related skin-ulceration \u2013 no significant difference\n\n7.6% vs. 6.8%\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn this single-center, randomised clinical trial, NIV delivered by helmet significantly reduced the intubation rate amongst patients with ARDS compared with the patients receiving NIV by face mask. The helmet was also associated with improved ventilator-free days and significantly reduced ICU length of stay as well as 90-day mortality.\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised trial\nNo crossover between groups\nNo patients lost to follow-up\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle-centre study\nNon-blinded\nCriteria for starting NIV not standardised\nProbably a cohort with relatively mild ARDS\n\nRequirement for 8 hours of NIV prior to enrollment likely to have excluded more hypoxic patients\nMedian duration of NIV after randomisation 19.8 vs. 26.4 hours\n\n\nMultiple protocol changes to broaden inclusion criteria to include all causes of respiratory failure\nEarly termination of the trial likely to overestimate the treatment effect\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHelmet NIV shows promise as a tool to reduce the need for intubation in patients with rapidly reversible hypoxaemic respiratory failure. However, larger trials are needed to determine if these results are generalisable outside of this small single-centre study\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of Noninvasive Ventilation Delivered by Helmet vs Face Mask on the Rate of Endotracheal Intubation in Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n[further reading]\u00a0St Emlyn\u2019s Journal Club: Helmets or masks for NIV\n[further reading]\u00a0EMNerd \u2013 The Case of the Unmasked Rival\n[further reading]\u00a0The Bottom Line: FLORALI\n[further reading] 2021: Randomized clinical trial comparing helmet continuous positive airway pressure (hCPAP) to facemask continuous positive airway pressure (fCPAP) for the treatment of acute respiratory failure in the emergency department\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@tompratt\nSummary date:\u00a09th October 2016\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@davidslessor\n\n\n"
