NEJM. 2017.\u00a0DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1706222\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with suspected myocardial infarction with no baseline hypoxia, does\u00a0oxygen therapy or room air improve all-cause mortality at 1 year?\n\nBackground\n\nSupplemental oxygen given during AMI is a common intervention and is recommended in current guidelines.\u00a0The rationale is that oxygen improves oxygen delivery to ischaemic myocardium, causing a reduction in infarct size and complications.\u00a0However studies for many years have\u00a0suggested oxygen may be harmful.\u00a0Supernormal oxygen has been shown to increase coronary vasoconstriction and production of oxygen free radicals\nThe AVOID trial recently showed that in patients with STEMI, oxygen compared to air caused an increase in CK and myocardial infarct size at 6 months.\u00a0Thus the authors in this study investigated whether supplemental oxygen in normoxic patients with suspected AMI improves outcomes\n\nDesign\n\nInvestigator initiated, multicenter, open label, parallel-group, randomised\u00a0controlled trial\nEnrolment and data collection including mortality data were facilitated through the SWEDEHEART registry (Swedish National Inpatient and Outpatient Registries)\n1:1 unrestricted computer generated randomisation\nTreating physicians and patients not blinded\nAssessors blinded\nSample size calculation: Baseline mortality of AMI group was 14.4%. Assuming a significance level of 0.05, and a power of 0.90, a total of 2856 patients in each group was needed\u00a0to detect a 20% fall in mortality from any cause at 1 year from the delivery of oxygen. This was inflated to 3300 to account for cross over, making final total of 6600 patients\nPre published design and statistical plan\nModified intention to treat analysis\nKaplan-Meier, Cox proportional-hazards models analysis\n\nSetting\n\n35 out of a possible 69 Swedish hospitals participated\nPatents enrolled April 2013 to December 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdult patients >30 years old presenting to an ambulance, ED, or the cath lab with symptoms suspicious for AMI with oxygen saturation of 90% or higher on pulse oximetry\nSuspicious for AMI was defined as any chest pain or shortness of breath for less than 6 hours\u00a0and either electrocardiographic changes indicating ischemia or elevated cardiac troponin T or I levels on admission\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nPatients already receiving oxygen \u226520minutes, post cardiac arrest, or those not consenting\n\n\nBaseline demographics were similar between oxygen and air groups:\n\nMedian time of symptom onset to randomisation was 245 vs 250mins\nProportion admitted with chest pain similar- 3123 (94%) vs 3120 (94%)\nFinal diagnosis of STEMI similar 43.2% vs 45.8%\n\n\nImpact of intervention\n\nMedian duration oxygen therapy was 11.6 hours.\nMedian saturations at the end of the time period were 99% for oxygen group and 97% for ambient air\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nSupplemental oxygen (6L/min via for 6-12 hours)\u00a0delivered through an open face mask\n\nControl\n\nRoom air (no face mask)\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nIf either group developed hypoxia with sats <90%, additional supplemental oxygen was provided\nAll other treatments left to the discretion of the clinicians\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nNo difference in all cause mortality at one year 166/3311 (5.0%) vs 168/3318 (5.1%) (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 1.21; P=0.80)\nNo difference in a per protocol population either\u00a04.7% (141/3014) and 5.1% (163/3212), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.14; P=0.40)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nNo difference in rehospitalisation at one year 126 patients (3.8%) vs\u00a0111 patients (3.3%). Hazard ratio:\u00a01.13; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.46; P=0.33\nNo difference in median troponin peak (946ng vs 983ng)\nOxygen patients were less likely to have inotropes commenced 46 (1.4%) vs 70 (2.1%)\nOxygen patents had less episodes of hypoxia 62 patients (1.9%) vs\u00a0 254 (7.7%)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nRoutine use of supplemental oxygen in patients with suspected myocardial infarction who did not have hypoxemia was not found to reduce 1-year all-cause mortality\n\nStrengths\n\nLargest trial to date investigating oxygen therapy in suspected AMI patients\nGood design to minimise bias (multicenter, randomised controlled design)\nPatient centered outcome (mortality and rehospitalization)\nNovel design with RCT embedded into a registry\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThere was little separation between the two arms of the study (i.e. sats were 97% vs 99%), and therefore a beneficial or negative effect of oxygen is still be possible\nThe intervention included a face mask as well as oxygen, compared to no mask and air, which may have introduced confounding\nThe patients and clinicians were not blinded risking significant bias\nThe pragmatic design enrolling all patients with suspected AMI may have missed important differences in sicker subpopulations \u2013 such as in the AVOID study which only enrolled STEMI patients\nThe baseline mortality rate of 14.4% for the power calculation was significantly overestimated compared to the actual mortality rate of \u00a05%. Thus there was a potential for type II (false negative) error\nLimited follow-up data only (mortality and re-hospitalisation at 1 year only) compared with other studies e.g. infarct size on MRI, or other functional outcomes\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis large MCRCT shows that supplemental oxygen does not make any difference to outcomes in normoxic patients with suspected AMI\nThis result combined with other recent studies that have suggested potential harm from oxygen, plus the fact oxygen is not free, suggests that oxygen therapy in this population is no warranted\nWe await more up to date guidelines that will reflect this\n\nExternal Links\n\n[abstract]\u00a0Oxygen Therapy in Suspected Acute Myocardial Infarction.
