JAMA 2022; doi:10.1001/jama.2022.17927\nClinical Question\n\nIn mechanically ventilated adults, does the addition of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) compared to standard care reduce all-cause hospital mortality within 90 days?\n\nBackground\n\nSDD has been around for nearly 40 years\nSDD is the application of non-absorbable antimicrobials to the oropharynx and GI tract in combination with a short course of IV antibiotics to target gram negative bacteria, Staph Aureus and yeasts\nMultiple systematic reviews have reported statistically significant reductions in both hospital mortality and hospital acquired pneumonia\nDespite this, international uptake is low with concerns about generalisability of previous RCTs and around development of antibiotic resistance\n\nA large RCT in 2018 found no increased rates of multi-drug resistance with SDD\n\n\nSuDDICU was designed to help address this uncertainty\n\nDesign\n\nCross-over, cluster randomised controlled trial:\n\nICUs were stratified by size and randomly assigned by computer generated program to either use SDD in the first 12-month period, or continue standard care\nICUs then crossed over to the alternate choice for the second 12-month period\n\n\nConcomitant observational ecological assessment:\n\nNon-inferiority design\nData on all new organisms in blood and non-blood cultures, positive C.Difficile test results and any antibiotic resistance from cultures was collected\nData collected for 1 week per month of each three-month ecology periods (pre-trial, inter-period, post-trial and last 3 months of each 12 month trial period)\nAll patients in the ICU were included in ecology data collection, except those ventilated in the SDD intervention group\n\n\nTime flow of intervention and ecology periods:\n\n3-month pre-trial period\n\nEcological assessment only\n\n\nIntervention period 1 (12 months)\n\nBoth intervention and ecological assessment\n\n\n3-month inter-period gap\n\nEcological Assessment only\n\n\nIntervention period 2 (12 months)\n\nBoth intervention and ecological assessment\n\n\n3-month post-trial period\n\nEcological assessment only\n\n\n\n\nWaiver of individual consent up to hospital discharge was obtained as intervention was ICU, or patients received no intervention (control and ecological groups)\nAppropriate trial registration and ethical approvals\nPower Calculation\n\nSDD: 6000 patients from 20 ICUs provided an absolute 4.2% reduction from a baseline mortality rate of 29%\n\n80% power, alpha of 0.05\n\n\nEcological Assessment: 40-50 ICUs recruiting 110-150 patients per period had 80% power to reject a non-inferiority margin of 2% for antibiotic resistance (based on an incidence of 10% for resistance)\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n17 hospitals (19 ICUs) in Australia\nMay 2017 to November 2021\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nMechanical ventilation via ETT on admission to ICU, or requirement mechanical ventilation during ICU admission\nPredicted to remain intubated for > 48 hours\n\nPatients could be rescreened if ventilated for > 48 hours\n\n\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nEnrolled in a trial that would interact with intervention\nKnown allergy to drugs used\nKnown or suspected pregnancy\nNot expected to survive 12 hours\n\n\nSite inclusion and exclusion criteria published in Table 1 of protocol summary and statistical analysis plan\n14851 enrolled\n\n5982 in intervention study\n\n2791 SDD\n3191 Standard Care\n\n\n8599 in ecological assessment\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of SDD vs. standard

17%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nSDD consisted of:\n\n6 hourly\u00a0application of 0.5g of paste containing 10 mg of colistin, 10 mg of tobramycin, and 125\u202f000 IU of nystatin applied to the buccal mucosa and oropharynx\n6 hourly administration of 10 mL of gastric suspension containing 100 mg of colistin, 80 mg of tobramycin, and 2 \u00d7 106 IU of nystatin to the upper gastrointestinal tract via a gastric or postpyloric tube\n4-day course of an intravenous SDD-compliant antibiotic (eg, a third-generation cephalosporin or ciprofloxacin)\n\nNot required if already treated with antibiotics with activity against gram-negative bacteria during the first 4 days after enrolment\n\n\n\n\nAdministered ASAP after ICU admission and enrolment\nContinued to cessation of ventilation via ETT or day 90\n\nControl\n\nStandard Care\n\nOral Chlorhexidine allowed\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll other treatment, including prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotic use, at discretion of treating clinicians\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: In-hospital 90-day mortality \u2013 non significant\n\n27.0% (SDD) vs 29.1% (Standard Care)\nOR 0.91 (95% CI 0.82 \u2013 1.02), p =

Difficile infection but not for cultures of antibiotic resistant organisms\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe use of SDD did not reduce in-hospital mortality, however the confidence interval does not exclude a clinically important benefit\n\nStrengths\n\nHigh quality RCT with very strong internal validity\nExcellent and highly detailed ecological analysis is crucially important given prior concerns\nSignificant exposure to SDD within ICUs is important for ecological analysis \u2013 approximately ~65000 doses of both suspension and paste given\nCluster, crossover design allows adequate evaluation of unit microbiology and ecology; individual patient randomisation may not have allowed this\nPre-published protocol and statistical analysis plan\nBalanced baseline characteristics\nNo loss to follow up\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle country may limit external validity, especially in countries where antimicrobial usage and resistance patterns are different\n\nCanadian centres have had slower recruitment, and their data will be published separately \u2013 this will hopefully improve external validity with the inclusion of data from an additional country\n\n\n1203 protocol violations (Supplement 4 eTable 14) in SDD group\n\n~10% for SDD paste not being administered for one full day, ~13% SDD antibiotics not being administered for one full day, ~10% neither paste not antibiotics administered within 6 hours of enrolment\nA detailed log for non-administration is supplied\n\n\nApproximately ~50% of all patients in standard care arm received SDD compliant IV antibiotics \u2013 this may bias result towards null (Supplement 4 eFigure 5b)\n\nPost hoc analyses adjusting for antibiotics and chlorhexidine didn\u2019t alter overall findings\n\n\nLow rates of antimicrobial resistance found in all cultures (~10%, eTable 11) and relatively short periods of ecological data collection may limit power to determine SDD non-inferiority with regards to ecological outcomes\nUncertainty persists as to what SDD regime is best\n\nThe subgroup looking at use of IV or no IV antibiotics in the simultaneously published meta analysis seems to show a benefit only with IV antibiotic usage\n\n\nPowered to detect a 4.2% reduction in mortality \u2013 this may have been overly optimistic\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAlthough this trial did not show a statistically significant benefit of SDD with respect to in hospital 90-day mortality, the associated Bayesian meta-analysis suggests that SDD has a 99.3% posterior probability of lower hospital mortality (Moderate certainty of evidence)\nThis mortality benefit does seem hard to ignore; however SDD implementation would require multi-speciality buy-in and would need safe systems for the analysis for the enormous amount of ecological data that would need to be collected and monitored to ensure safety with regards to any developing antimicrobial resistance patterns\n\nExternal Links\n\nEffect of Selective Decontamination of the Digestive Tract on Hospital Mortality in Critically Ill Patients Receiving Mechanical Ventilation: A Randomized Clinical Trial\nfurther reading Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker @hgmwalker89\nSummary date: 31st October 2022\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\nPicture by: Gerd Altmann / Pixabay\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
