JAMA 2016; 316(5): 1555-1564. doi:10.1001/jama.2016.14655\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients with non-neutropenic sepsis, multiple Candida colonisation and multi organ failure, does empirical micafungin\u00a0therapy increase invasive fungal infection-free survival at day 28 compared with placebo?\n\nBackground\n\nAlthough frequently used in treating intensive care unit patients with sepsis, empirical antifungal therapy, initiated for suspected fungal infection, has not been shown to improve outcome\nTwo previous multicenter randomized clinical trials evaluated empirical antifungal therapy for fungal infection suspicion in patients with a central catheter and persistent fever despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibacterial agents\n\nSchuster et al. Ann Intern Med 2008 \u2013 Empirical fluconazole did not improve composite clinical outcomes vs placebo in patients at high risk for invasive candidiasis\nOstrosky-Zeichner et al. Clin Infect Dis 2014 \u2013 Empirical caspofungin in ICU patients, with at least 2 risk factors for candidaemia, reduced incidence of invasive candidiasis (but no statistical difference)\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nMulticentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel group study\nPermuted-block randomisation using varying block size\nModified intention to treat analysis, including all patients who received at least one dose of treatment\nBlood cultures drawn at inclusion. If blood cultures were subsequently positive for invasive candidiasis, the study drug was withdrawn and usual unit anti-fungal treatment was prescribed (patient still included in analysis)\n235 patients were required to detect an absolute difference of 18% in the primary endpoint with an 80% power at a 0.05 significance level. It was decided that 260 patients were needed to account for attrition\n\nSetting\n\n19 ICUs in France\nJuly 2012 \u2013 Feb 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adult ICU patients who were mechanically ventilated for at least 5 days with one or more other organ failure and new ICU-acquired sepsis of unknown origin AND\n\nPresence of a central vein catheter and/or an arterial line\nUse of broad spectrum antibacterial agent\u00a0\u2265 4 days during the last seven days\nAt least one colonisation site (other than rectal swab or stool) positive for Candida species\n\n\n\u00a0Exclusion:\n\nProven invasive infection requiring antifungal treatment at the time of randomisation\nAntifungal treatment with an echinocandin > 1 day or with any other antifungal agent > 72 hours the week preceding the inclusion\nNeutropenia (neutrophils count < 500/mm3)\nPrevious bone marrow or solid organ transplantation\nRecent chemotherapy (< 6 months) or receiving systemic immunosuppressants\n\n\n\n\n\n518 patients screened, 260 randomised, 251 included in final analysis (the 9 missing withdrew consent)\nThere were some differences in baseline characteristics:\n\nIntervention group had higher BMI (over 30- 41% vs 30%), and greater incidence of chronic renal disease (12% vs 6%), and diabetes (34% vs 20%)\nControl group had a greater incidence of chronic respiratory disease (33% vs 20%), immunosuppressed patients (8% vs 4%) and septic shock (37% vs 31%)\nOther characteristics (age, illness severity, gender) were similar between both groups\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n100mg micafungin/day as a 1 hour infusion for 14 days\n\nControl\n\n100mls of 0.9% NaCl as a 1 hour infusion for 14 days\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nNo statistical difference in patients alive and free\u00a0from invasive fungal infection at day 28\n\nEighty-seven (68%) patients in the micafungin group vs 74 (60.2%) patients in the placebo group\nHR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.87-2.08; P= 0.18\nHazard ratios in modified ITT analysis and predefined subgroups did not reach statistical significant between the groups\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nmicafungin group had a significantly lower incidence of new proven invasive fungal infections during follow up:\n\n4 (3%) in the micafungin group vs 15 (12%) of the placebo group developed at least one new proven fungal infection (P= 0.008)\nFragility index = 3\n\n\n\n\nNo statistical difference in\n\nSurvival at day 28:\u00a070% placebo vs 70% micafungin P=0.95\nSurvival at day 90: 55% placebo vs 56% micafungin; P=0.90\nAntifungal-free survival at day 28\nIncidence of ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia\nEvolution of the SOFA score over the 28 day study period\nEvolution of\u00a0serum level of (1-3)-\u03b2-D-glucan over 28 days\n\n\nAdverse events: Micafungin was well tolerated with minimal adverse effects in comparison to the placebo\n\n3 patients in the micafungin group had serious adverse events related to the drug (one cholestasis, one toxidermal reaction, one delirium; all resolved)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong non-neutropenic critically ill patients with ICU acquired sepsis, Candida species colonisation at multiple sites, and multiple organ failure, empirical treatment with micafungin compared with placebo did not increase fungal infection-free survival at day 28\n\nStrengths\n\nLarge study investigating the effect of empirical anti-fungal treatment\nMulticentre performed across university-affiliated and non-university hospitals, adding to it\u2019s external validity\nAppropriately powered\nAllocation concealment\nBlinding achieved by pharmacy producing opaque bags containing micafungin or placebo\nStatistical analyses used on secondary end points were predefined\nNo patients lost to follow up\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\nAn homogenous group of patients were selected, which improves the internal validity of the trial\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSuch an homogenous group of patients is highly selective and fairly uncommon;\u00a0demonstrated by the fact it took 19 ICUs 3 years to recruit 260 patients \u2013 which averages at 4 patients per site per year\nGeneral ICU management (such as lung protective ventilation) was not standardised between groups or between units \u2013 affecting the internal and external validity of the trial\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study does not support empirical anti-fungal therapy with micafungin in a select group of intensive care patients at high risk of invasive candidiasis\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Empirical Micafungin Treatment and Survival Without Invasive Fungal Infection in Adults With ICU-Acquired Sepsis, Candida Colonization, and Multiple Organ Failure-\u00a0The EMPIRICUS Randomized Clinical Trial\n[Editorial]\u00a0Empirical Antifungal Therapy in Critically Ill Patients With Sepsis\n[Video]\u00a0ICTV Hot topics- the EMPIRICUS trial\n[Article review] ESICM\u00a0The EMPIRICUS trial\n[Further reading]\u00a0Revised Definitions of Invasive Fungal Disease from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) Consensus Group\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Segun Olusanya\nSummary date: 19th May 2017\nPeer-review editor: Adrian Wong\n\n\n"
