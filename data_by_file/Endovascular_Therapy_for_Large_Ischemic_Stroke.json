NEJM 2022; 386:1303-1313. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2118191\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with large cerebral infarction volumes does the use of endovascular therapy alongside medical care compared with medical care alone improve 90-day functional outcomes?\n\nBackground\n\nEndovascular treatment (EVT) of acute stroke caused by the occlusion of large vessels has been proven to be a highly effective treatment that reduces death and disability\nThis has been proven in multiple trials (MR CLEAN, DAWN, EXTEND-IA, DEFUSE III, SWIFT PRIME)\nThe ASPECTS score is a semi-quantitive score to characterise the extent of middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke\n\nIt ranges from 10 to 0, where 0 indicates the largest infarct burden\n\n\nPrevious trials have excluded (or have limited numbers of) those with larger infarct volumes due to concerns surrounding risk of bleeding following reperfusion\nA systematic review looking at those with a larger infarct volume (ASPECTS < 6 or core volume > 50 cc) found no risk of increased haemorrhage and improved functional outcomes with the use of EVT\n\nDesign\n\nOpen-label, parallel-group, RCT\nCentral randomisation in a 1:1 ratio\n\nAlgorithm used to balance trial group assignments within hospitals on basis of age, interval between last known well and arrival, NIHSS score on admission,\u00a0 and use of rt-PA\n\n\nAssignments not concealed from patients or treating physicians\nTrained assessors of mRS blinded\nClinical assessments performed at baseline and then 12 hours, 24 \u2013 72 hours, 5 \u2013 9 days and 60 \u2013 120 days after randomisation\nPower calculation based on local registry data, which showed an aOR of 3.42 in favour of EVT\n\nGiven this was observational registry data the authors assumed an adjusted OR of 2.7 (20% less than observed)\nThis required 81 in each arm, which was increased to 200 in total to allow for 15% drop out and withdrawal of consent (90% power with two-sided alpha of 0.05)\n\n\nPrimary analysis performed on all those randomised and had assessable outcome data\nEvent adjudication (assessing the mRS scores used for randomisation) and imaging committees (assessing the imaging used for randomisation) could remove patients from trial if clinical or imaging parameters used for inclusion were not met on review\n\nA per-protocol analysis performed on those not excluded\n\n\nPre-specified subgroups\n\nThe subgroup for time last known well was added post-hoc\n\n\nWritten informed consent provided prior to enrolment\n\nSetting\n\nJapan, 45 hospitals\nNovember 2018 \u2013 September 2021\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n> 18 years old\nNIHSS score of at least 6\na pre-morbid mRS of 0 or 1\nInternal carotid or M1 segment of middle cerebral artery occlusion on CTA/MRA\nASPECTS score 3 \u2013 5\nWithin 6 hours of last known well or if within 6 \u2013 24 hours then FLAIR sequence on MRI had to show recent infarct\nEVT initiated within 60 minutes following randomisation\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nClinically significant mass effect with midline shift\nAcute intracranial haemorrhage\nPregnant or suspected pregnancy\nEvidence of chronic occlusion\nInvestigators felt high risk of haemorrhage (Plts < 40, APTT > 50, INR > 3)\nJudged to likely be non-compliant or uncooperative\n\n\n235 assessed for eligibility \u2013> 203 randomised\n\n100 in EVT group (6 excluded after adjudication) \u2013> 94 per protocol\n102 in medical group (8 excluded) \u2013> 94 per protocol\nAcross both arms, 11/14 removed were for ASPECTS score other than 3 to 5 or no presence of ICA or M1 occlusion\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of EVT vs. Medical Care group\n\nGenerally similar although larger infarct volume in Medical Care\nAge: 76.6 vs 75.7\nMale: 54.5% vs 56.9%\nMedical History:\n\nHypertension: 70.3% vs 68.6%\nAF: 59.4% vs 58.8%\n\n\nSystolic BP: 156 mmHg vs 163 mmHg\nMedian mRS prior: 0 vs 0\nMedian NIHSS at baseline: 22 vs 22\nMedian ASPECTS: 3 vs

randomisation: 229 mins vs 214 mins\nFor those in EVT group:\n\nMedian time between stroke onset and reperfusion: 308 mins\nTICI >/= 2b: 86%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nEndovascular Therapy and Medical Care\n\nEVT method selected by treating physicians (could include stent retriever, aspiration catheter, balloon angioplasty, intracranial or carotid stent)\n\n98% had thrombectomy\n\n\nSuccess defined as TICI2b (anterograde reperfusion of > 50% of previously occluded territory)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nMedical Care only\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nrt-tPA allowed (0.6mg/kg) as per Japanese guidelines and at discretion of treating physician\nMedical Care was as per the AHA and American Stroke Association guidelines\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome (mRS of 0-3 at 90 days)\n\nComparing EVT vs Medical Care\n31% vs 12.7%\n\nRelative Risk 2.43 (95% CI 1.35 \u2013 4.37), p = 0.002\nARR 18.3% (95% CI 7.1 \u2013 18.3%)\nNNT 6 (95% CI 3.4 \u2013 14.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nComparing EVT vs. Medical Care group\n\nNo significant difference in\n\nmRS of 0-2 at 90 days\n\n14.0% vs 7.8% (RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.78 \u2013 4.07)\n\n\nmRS of 0 or 1 at 90 days\n\n5.0% vs 2.9% (RR 1.70, 95% CI

NIHSS at 48 hr\n\n31.0% vs 8.8% (RR 3.51, 95% CI 1.76 \u2013 7.00)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected Subgroups\n\nAll point estimates favoured EVT\nThe following subgroups had 95% CI that fully favoured EVT:\n\nAge \u2265 75: RR 3.05 (95% CI 1.19 \u2013 7.85)\nInterval between last known well and randomisation < 6 hrs: RR 2.43 (95% CI 1.25 \u2013 4.74)\nNo use of rt-PA: RR 2.52 (1.25 \u2013

ICH rates similar\n\n9.0% vs 4.9% (RR 1.84, 95% CI 0.64 \u2013 5.29, p = 0.25)\n\n\nOther safety outcomes including death within 90 days, recurrence of infarction within 90 days or decompressive craniectomy within 7 days were all similar\nProcedural complication rate: 8.9%\n\n5% vessel perforation\n\n\nOther serious AE:\n\n33.7% in EVT group compared to 18.6% in Medical Care\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the per-protocol analysis was similar to the results described above\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmongst patients in Japan with an acute stroke and large ischaemic region functional outcomes at 90 days were better with endovascular therapy and medical care compared to medical care alone\nEndovascular therapy was associated with a higher incidence of intracranial haemorrhage\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised trial answering an important clinical question in area of medicine that has a large evidence base for its use\nGenerally balanced baseline characteristics\nAnalysed on an intention to treat basis\n\nOf all those that were randomised only 1 patient in the EVT group withdrew consent and as such was not included in the analysis\n\n\nNo loss to follow up documented\nNo cross-over reported\nTrained and blinded assessors of primary outcome\nThe infarct volume was larger than in other trials:\n\nFor DAWN the infarct volume had to be < 50ml, for DEFUSE III < 70ml and median ASPECTS score of 9 in SWIFT PRIME\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle country setting may limit external validity\nOnly 6/45 centres had \u2265 10 participants and 20/25 had \u2264 3 (average 1/yr)\n\nThis maybe important with regards to the lower volume centres and complication rates\n\n\nmRS only rates physical ability but no other QoL metrics were reported which would no doubt be important to the patient\n\nHigh rates of cognitive impairment have been demonstrated post ischaemic stroke\n\n\nSlight but potentially clinically important change in primary outcome compared to other comparator trials\n\nDEFUSE III, EXTEND IA, SWIFT PRIME all used an mRS score of 0-2 as the primary outcome\nAn mRS of 2 is slight disability whereas 3 is moderate disability with the requirement with some assistance\nThere was no difference between groups for an mRS of 0-2 at 90d\n\n\nAlthough the ASPECTS score were higher in the medical group (better) the stroke volume was larger by 16 ml\nInitial approach to imaging may not be consistent with other countries initial radiological assessment of stroke in the ED:\n\nHigh rates of MRI (88%) as opposed to CT to determine ASPECTS score\n\nMRI has been shown to have lower ASPECT scores compared with CT\n\n\nNo use of perfusion imaging to guide treatment\n\nThis may help better determine salvageable tissue\n\n\n\n\nLow rates of rt-PA use compared to other countries (and lower doses)\n\nHigher rates of rt-PA may improve the outcomes in the medical care group\n\n\nFunded by Mihara Cerebrovascular Disorder Research Promotion Fund and Japanese Society for Neuro-Endovascular Therapy\n\nBoth non-profit and had no role in any design or conduct of the trial\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFollowing this trial it will be important to discuss the use of EVT in large ischaemic strokes\nHowever, any decision will need to be made in a multi-disciplinary approach given some concerns around external generalisability, the higher rates of intracranial haemorrhage and serious adverse events alongside the fact a large number of patients still have significant disability\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Endovascular Therapy
