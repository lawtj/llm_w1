Intensive Care Medicine 2017; 43:1637\u20131647. doi:10.1007/s00134-017-4880-3\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill adult patients, does early goal-directed nutrition (EGDN) during ICU stay compared to standard care nutrition delivery result in improved physical quality of life at 6 months?\n\nBackground\n\nThe importance of nutritional support during critical illness in the ICU is well established. However, the various aspects of delivering this nutritional care is unclear because of diverging conclusions from recent trials. This may contribute to the variations seen in clinical practice and in national and international guidelines\nAs an example,\u00a0ESPEN (European) guidelines recommend\u00a0early-initiation of parenteral nutrition (PN) whilst\u00a0ASPEN (American and Canadian) guidelines recommend later initiation of PN in adults who are receiving insufficient enteral nutrition in the intensive care unit (ICU)\nIndividualised goal-directed nutrition therapy with measured requirements has been proposed as one of several potentially beneficial strategies. EAT-ICU is the first randomised trial to assess the effect of individualised energy and protein supply to ICU patients, based on indirect calorimetry and 24-h urinary urea excretion (nitrogen balance) on physical quality of life\n\nDesign\n\nSingle centre randomised controlled trial\nBlinded outcome assessment\nComputer generated randomisation schedule with varying block sizes (prepared by 2 people independent of the trial)\nAllocation was concealed by consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes\nRandomised 1:1, stratified according to presence or absence of active haematologic malignancy\nPatients were randomised as soon as possible, with the intervention commenced at the latest 24 hours after admission to the ICU\n200 patients were required to demonstrate a 15% relative reduction in physical component summary (PCS) score at 6 months, with a significance level 0.05 and 80% power\n\nEstimations were based on previous data from the study site\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nSingle ICU (Copenhagen University Hospital) in Denmark\nJune 2013- October 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Acutely admitted, mechanically ventilated adult patients with a central venous catheter (for PN if required), expected to stay longer than 3 days in ICU\nExclusion mostly based on any particular nutrition requirements\n\nContraindications to use enteral nutrition or\u00a0parenteral nutrition, e.g. hypersensitivity towards fish-, egg or peanut protein, or any of the active substances in the PN products\nReceiving a special diet\nBurns > 10% total body surface area\nSevere hepatic failure (Child-Pugh class C) or severe hepatic dysfunction: Bilirubin \u2265 50 \u00b5mol/l (3 mg/dl) + alanine aminotransferase \u2265 3 times upper reference value\nTraumatic brain injury\nDiabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar non-ketotic acidosis\nKnown or suspected hyperlipidemia\nBMI \u2264 17 or severe malnutrition\nPregnancy\nThe clinician finds that the patient is too deranged (circulation, respiration, electrolytes etc.) or that death is imminent\n\n\nScreened: 2265 patients admitted to the ICU. 586 met inclusion and 383 were excluded. 203 (35%) were randomised (102 to EGDN and 101 to standard care)\n\n1 in each group died before randomisation and 1 in each group withdrew consent for data, therefore, 199 patients were analysed (100 in EGDN and 99 in standard care)\n\n\nBaseline characteristics: no statistically significant difference between groups (EGDN vs Standard care)\n\nMost common source of ICU admission was a hospital ward: 45% vs 38%\nAdmission type:\n\nMedical: 52% vs 43%\nEmergency surgery: 43% vs 54%\n\n\nAge, years, median (IQR): 63 (51-72) vs 68 (52-75)\nSAPS II score, median (IQR): 8 (6-11) vs 8 (5-10)\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nEarly Goal Directed Nutrition\n\nCalculated nutrition requirements and delivery were based on:\n\nEnergy delivery directed by indirect calorimetry (IC) at randomisation and every other day\n24-h urinary urea excretion (nitrogen use) was assessed daily and converted to metabolic protein consumption using Bistrian\u2019s equation\n\n\n\n\nNutrition provision was titrated to IC and nitrogen balance with the aim to meet 100% of energy and protein needs on the first full trial day and for the duration of ICU stay (to a maximum of 90 days)\nProtein was provided as at least 1.5 g/kg/day at all times during admission, regardless of urea excretion\nEnergy from propofol was included in energy calculations\nEnteral nutrition was initiated within 24 h of randomisation and supplemented with PN if necessary to reach goal requirements\n\nIn case of sustained hyperglycaemia (defined as insulin requirement of at least 5 IU/h for > 12 consecutive hours), glucose was reduced and at a plasma urea above 20 mmol/l, protein was reduced by 0.2 g/kg/day\n\n\nSupplemental PN was used if energy and protein needs could not be met by EN alone\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard Care\n\nEnergy requirements calculated by 25/kcal/kg/day\nEN commenced within 24 hours of randomisation and gradually increase as tolerated\nIf on day 7 energy needs were not met, supplemental PN was provided\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nThe same EN and PN solutions\nThe same blood glucose level (BGL) aims (6-10 mmol/l)\nSupplemental trace elements and vitamins based on measurements\nThe same gastric residual volume (GRV) cut off and protocol for management (based on usual practice in the ICU)\nThe same mobilisation protocol (based on usual practice in the ICU)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: physical quality of life 6 months after randomisation as assessed by the physical component summary (PCS) score of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form health survey version\u00a0did not differ between the two groups\n\nMean PCS score 22.9 vs standard care: 23.0; p = 0.99\nSimilar results in the predefined sensitivity analyses of the complete case population, the per-protocol populations, the two predefined subgroups and in the analyses adjusted for the stratification variable (haematological malignancy) and the predefined baseline variables (age and SOFA score)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nMortality at day 28, day 90 and at 6 months: no statistical difference between groups\n\nday 28: 20% dead in EGDT vs 21% in control group\nday 90: 30% dead in EGDT vs 32% in control group\n6 months: 37% dead in EGDT vs 34% in control group\n\n\nCumulative energy and protein balances at day 1, 3 and 7 and over the course of the ICU stay was higher in the EGDN group\n\nday 1: -211 vs -1011 kcal & 0.07 vs -0.7 g/kg protein\nday 3:\u00a0-220 vs -924 kcal & -0.59 vs -0.83 g/kg protein\nday 7:\u00a0-298 vs -702 kcal & -0.65 vs -0.75 g/kg protein\nlast study day:\u00a0-249 vs -747 kcal & -0.56 vs -0.65 g/kg protein\n\nall p<0.0001\n\n\n\n\nInsulin requirement: the EGDN group received a greater median (IQR) dose of insulin and had a greater proportion of BGL \u2265 15 mmol/L\n\nInsulin: 86 (2-530) vs 0 (0-39), p=0.008\nBGL \u2265 15 mmol/L: 52% vs 25%, p=0.0001\n\n\n\n\nEpisodes of hyperglycaemia:\u00a0More patients in the EGDN group experienced at least one episode of hyperglycaemia\nNo difference in:\n\nlength of stay among survivors in ICU or hospital\nnew organ failure\ntime to any infection or type of nosocomial infection\nrates of hypoglycaemia\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe EGDN strategy resulted in greater energy and protein delivery in the ICU compared to standard care, but no differences were observed in PSC score at 6 months or any other clinically important outcomes\n\nStrengths\n\nA highly relevant clinical question and hot research topic\nThe primary outcome was a long term, physically focused outcome\nStudy design attempts to address and provide titrated nutrition based on metabolic changes that occur during critical illness. This is only attempted in a few previous RCTs\nProvides further evidence about the utility of IC in critical illness\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThis is a small, single centre study, and so the results may not be generalisable to all populations\nThe primary outcome was a long term outcome, but the intervention was early and very short duration. It may not be biologically plausible that the intervention would effect the outcome\nMissing data was imputed. It seemed to be well understood and conducted by the authors but there is always a risk of inappropriate imputation\nThe patients may not have been likely to benefit from intervention as they were not long stay patients (7 days)\nEarly nutrition intervention when metabolic processes are aimed to mobilise endogenous energy stores may place the patient under further metabolic stress\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn critically ill adults, EGDN provided early in ICU stay, and for a short duration, resulted in better nutritional outcomes but there was no difference in clinically important outcomes\nThis study provides a base from which future research can be conducted into questions such as when nutrition should be commenced and how metabolic processes differ during critical illness\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Early goal-directed nutrition versus standard of care in adult intensive care patients: the single-centre, randomised, outcome assessor-blinded EAT-ICU trial\n[further reading] Editorial (not open access)\n[videocast] Interview with Anders Perner at ESICM LIVES 2017\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Emma Ridley\nSummary date: 18th October 2017\nPeer-review editor: Steve Mathieu\u00a0and Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
