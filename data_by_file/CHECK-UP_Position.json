Chest 2017; 152(4):712-722. doi:\u00a010.1016/j.chest.2017.03.061\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients undergoing emergency intubation, does the ramped position compared to sniffing position reduce the incidence of oxygen desaturation?\n\nBackground\n\nHypoxaemia occurs in nearly 50% of Critical Care intubations\nPatient position may improve variables such as functional residual capacity and laryngeal anatomy\nObservational data support the ramped position (torso and head elevated) compared to the sniffing position (patient supine, neck flexed and head extended)\n\nDesign\n\n2 x 2 factorial design\n\nOther side of the study assessed the use of an intubation checklist vs standard care in the critically ill adults: CHECK-UP Checklist\n\n\nRandomised, multicentre pragmatic trial\nPatients randomised in a 1:1 ratio using a computer and permuted blocks\nData collected by an independent observer, with quality/accuracy assurance carried out on 10% of the cases\n248 patients required to power the study at 80% to detect a difference between the two groups in primary outcome of 5%\n\n5% chosen based on previous similar studies\nInitial power calculations required only 170 patients\nAfter assessment of the standard deviations (SD) of the primary outcome for the whole study population at 6 months, the SD was larger than anticipated so a new power calculation was performed\n\nGroup assignments remained concealed\n\n\n\n\nIntention to treat analysis\n\nSetting\n\nFour tertiary ICUs in the United States\nJuly 2015 to July 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\u00a0Patients over the age of 18 undergoing endotracheal intubation by critical care or pulmonary fellows in the medical ICU\nExclusion:\n\nIf intubation was so urgent that the clinician felt the randomisation envelope could not be obtained in time\nIf treating clinicians felt that a specific position was clinically indicated\n\n\n309 eleigible, 49 excluded (42 due to urgency, 6 due to specifically indicated intubation position), 260 randomised\nThe most common reasons for intubation in both groups were sepsis, altered mental status and pneumonia\n\nIntervention\n\nRamped position for intubation\n\nElectronic bed used to elevate head of the bed to 25 degrees with the lower half of the bed parallel to the floor\nPatient\u2019s head was positioned at the top of the mattress so it hung slightly off the bed with the face parallel to the ceiling\n\n\n\nThe Ramped Position for Intubation\nControl\n\nSniffing position for intubation\n\nEntire bed remained horizontal\nFolded blankets/towels placed beneath the patient\u2019s head with the neck in flexion and the head in extension as if \u201csniffing the air\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cSniffing the Air\u201d Position for Intubation\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll aspects of the intubation procedure were at the discretion of the clinical team\nMeasures of primary outcomes took place from the moment the procedural medications were administered until two minutes after the successful intubation\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\u00a0There was no statistically significant difference in the median lowest oxygen saturation between the sniffing and the ramped positions\n\nSniffing \u2013 92% [IQR 79-98%]\nRamped \u2013 93% [IQR 84-99%]\nThis still held true after multivariable linear regression analysis to adjust for cofounders including saturation at induction, BMI, operator experience and use of video laryngoscopy\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nThe view achieved and difficulty of the intubation was worse in the ramped group\n\nCormack-Lehane view Grade III or IV:\n\nSniffing 11.6% vs Ramped 25.4% (p=0.01)\n\n\nOperator reported \u201cdifficult\u201d intubation:\n\nSniffing 4.6% vs Ramped 12.3% (p=0.04)\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, the rate of failed intubation attempts was unsurprisingly higher in the ramped group\n\nFirst attempt success:\n\nSniffing 85.4% vs Ramped 76.2% (p=0.02)\n\n\nMore than 3 attempts at laryngoscopy:\n\nSniffing 2.3% vs Ramped 7.7% (p=0.02)\n\n\n\n\nNo difference between other oxygenation or haemodynamic secondary outcomes\n\nOxygenation outcomes\n\nIncidence of hypoxia or severe hypoxia, desaturation and absolute change from baseline saturation\n\n\nHaemodynamic outcomes\n\nLowest systolic BP, systolic BP <65, use of a vasopressor and cardiac arrest within 10mins of intubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTertiary data, subgroup or post-hoc analyses\n\nNo statistically significant difference in tertiary outcomes of ventilator free days, ICU days or in-hospital mortality\nIn post-hoc analysis, the operator\u2019s previous intubating experience did not alter the primary outcome\nSimilarly, the operator\u2019s prior experience in the ramped position did not alter the primary outcome\n\nAlthough this data was only available for 73.8% of the intubations carried out\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe ramped position was not associated with an increase in the lowest arterial saturation during intubation of critically ill patients in the ICU, but it may increase the difficulty of the intubation and the likelihood of repeated attempts\n\nStrengths\n\nRelevant question for daily ICU practice, especially as data from the anaesthetic room does not always translate well to the ICU\nProspective, multicentre study with larger numbers than similar trials in the anaesthetic room\nFirst study of its kind in the ICU\nBaseline characteristics well balanced between the two groups, importantly including pre-oxygenation method, APACHE II score, BMI and difficult airway characteristics\nMinimal deviation from protocol (3 total)\nQuality assurance took place to improve accuracy of data collection.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nFactorialised design\n\nAlthough they claim that there was no interaction between the position and the use of a checklist (p=0.94), they both assessed the same primary outcome\nWould have been better to do these two studies separately\n\n\nIncomplete data for the clinician\u2019s past experience with the ramped position as it was only available for 73.8% of cases\nOnly included fellow/trainee clinicians\n\nWould have been better to also include those performed by the more senior clinicians\nCases where the senior clinician feels that they must have first attempt at intubation are perhaps sicker or more challenging\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAmong adult ICU patients, the ramped position did not improve the lowest recorded saturations but did increase the difficulty of intubation and the likelihood of repeated attempts\nDespite the ramped position being more technically challenging, this did not translate into any difference in any patient-centred outcomes\nWe should therefore still assess each intubation on a case by case basis, factoring in our previous experience and comfort level when choosing patient position for intubating the critically unwell patient\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0A multicenter, randomized trial of ramped position vs sniffing position during endotracheal intubation of
