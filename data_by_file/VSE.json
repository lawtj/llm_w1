JAMA.2013;310(3):270-279. doi:10.1001/jama.2013.7832\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients in cardiac arrest, does vasopressin +\u00a0epinephrine during CPR combined with steroid supplementation during and after CPR, improve survival to discharge with a good neurological outcome, in comparison to the use of epinephrine alone?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,\u00a0parallel-group trial\n\nblinding of staff assessing neurological outcome\n\n\nBlock randomisation stratified by centre\nModified intention to treat\n\nrandomised patients who did not require vasopressors were excluded\nrandomised patients that survived but who did not have \u00a0post-resuscitation shock were excluded from subgroup analysis\n\n\nBased on a predicted survival with favourable neurological recovery of 15% in the intervention group and 4% in the control group, the study was powered at 80%, with alpha set at 0.05, if 244 patients enrolled.\nMulti-variance logistic regressions used to determine Odds Ratios (OR)\n\nSetting\n\n3 tertiary centres in Greece\nSeptember 1, 2008, to October 1, 2010\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: in-hospital vasopressor-requiring cardiac arrest\n\nLocation of cardiac arrest: 16% ED, 41% ICU/CCU/Operating room, 43% hospital ward\n\n\nExclusion: age<18, terminal illness/DNAR, cardiac arrest due to exsanguination, pre-hospital cardiac arrest, treatment with IV steroids prior to arrest\n300 randomised out of 364 assessed for eligibility\n\n32 patients excluded post-randomisation as ROSC prior to need for vasopressors\nComparing intervention vs. control group, similar baseline characteristics apart from:\n\nmale sex 73.1% vs. 63.8%\nhospital stay before arrest (median) \u00a05 days vs 2 days\ncause of cardiac arrest\n\nmetabolic 8.5% vs 15.2%\nhypotension 46.9% vs. 37%\nmyocardial ischaemia/infarction 23.1% vs. 17.4%\n\n\nInitial rhythm\n\nasytole 63.8% vs. 70.3%, P=0.3\nPEA 19.2% vs. 13%, P=0.19\n\n\n\n\nNo significant differences in use of primary PCI or therapeutic hypothermia between study groups\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nCombination of\n\nvasopressin 20 IU/CPR cycle for 5 cycles\nadrenaline 1mg/CPR cycle\nsteroids\n\nmethylprednisolone 40mg during 1st cycle of CPR\nsurviving patients received hydrocortisone 300mg/d for <7days and gradual taper if postresuscitation shock\n\n>4hrs requirement of vasopressors to maintain MAP >70 after volume loading, in patients not previously on vasopressors; \u00a0(if already on vasopressors, >50% increase in vasopressors/inotropes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nAdrenaline 1mg/CPR cycle\u00a0+ placebos\n\nAverage CPR cycle duration ~3min in both intervention and control groups\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nsurvival to hospital discharge with favourable neurological outcome (Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category 1/2)\n\nsignificant improvement in intervention group\n\n13.9% vs. 5.1%; (OR 3.28, 95% C.I. 1.17-9.2, P=0.02, NNT 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nROSC for >20 minutes (stated as a 2nd primary outcome, but power calculation not performed for this outcome)\n\nsignificant improvement in intervention group\n\n83.9% vs. 65.9%, (OR 2.98 95% C.I. 1.39-6.4, P=0.005, NNT 6)\n\n\n\n\nPatients with post-resuscitation shock had significant improvement of survival to discharge with a good neurological outcome in the intervention group vs. control group\n\n21.1% vs 8.2%, OR 3.74 (95% C.I. 1.2-11.62, P=0.02)\n\n\nNumber of patients receiving insulin treatment within 1st 10 days \u2013 significantly higher in intervention group\n\n50.4% vs. 36%, P<0.001\n\n\nThere was no significant difference in rates of infection or gastro-intestinal bleeding between the two groups\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nPatient in cardiac arrest requiring vasopressors, have an improved survival with a good neurological outcome if they are treated with combined vasopressin/epinephrine/steroids compared with epinephrine alone\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised\nDouble blinded, and blinding of those assessing neurological status\nPlacebo controlled\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle geographical area\nSmall number of patients in total survived with a good neurological outcome (25 in total) making it difficult to make any definite decisions\nTherapeutic hypothermia only used in 24.6% of patients\nAtropine and bicarbonate used on a number of patients which is not consistent with current practice\nDifferences in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups\nLarge number of patients had cardiac arrest in critical care environment. These results may be be generalisable to centres at which this does not happen.\nBundle approach means that we do not know whether it was the whole bundle or any of the bundle elements that caused any differences in results found\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study has shown a significant improvement for survival to discharge with a good neurological outcome following cardiac arrest when treated with combination steroids/vasopessin/epinephrine in comparison to epinephrine alone. Of note, no RCT has shown this improvement when using epinephrine alone compared with placebo.\nHowever, before introducing this into routine practice I am waiting for a validation study in a different setting. This is a single study, set in only 3 centres in 1 country. There were only 18 patients who survived with a good outcome in the intervention group. We know that a number of promising treatments have been disproven when studies have been repeated in larger trials. I hope that someone takes up the challenge of attempting to validate this trial on an urgent basis so that a more evidenced based decision can be made.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Article full text pdf]\u00a0Vasopressin, Steroids and Epinephrine and Neurologically Favourable Survival After In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest A Randomized Clinical Trial\n[Review]\u00a0Under Pressure Journal Club (Vasopressin, Steroids and Epinephrine in Cardiac Arrest) by SGEM\n[Commentary]\u00a0Rob Mac Sweeney on Intra-Arrest Meds by EMCrit\n[Commentary]\u00a0EMCritWee\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 8 August 2014\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n\n"
