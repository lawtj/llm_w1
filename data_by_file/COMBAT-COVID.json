It regulates coagulation and inflammation\nIt is hypothesised that cleavage of thrombomodulin from the cell wall leads to a pro-thrombotic state\nProstacyclin is released by endothelial cell with paracrine function. It causes vasodilatation and inhibits platelet aggregation and therefore may be of benefit for patients with severe COVID-19\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n\nPermuted blocks of varying sizes\nStratified by site\nWeb-based concealed allocation\n\n\nParallel-grouped exploratory trial\nBlinding of treating staff, investigators and statistician\nMulticentre\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\nSample size calculation: 70 patients would provide 80% power to detect a 20% relative increase in the primary outcome from a baseline of 10 days with a false positive rate of 5%. Planned to recruit 80 patients to allow for ~10% drop-out\nIntention to treat analysis\n\nSetting\n\n5 university hospital ICUs in Denmark\nData collected June 2020 \u2013 January 2021\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAge \u226518\nMechanically ventilated\nConfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection\nSoluble thrombomodulin >4ng/ml\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nInvasive mechanical ventilation > 72 hours\nWithdrawal from active therapy\nPregnancy\nLife threatening bleeding\nKnown severe heart failure (NYHA class IV)\nSuspected acute coronary syndrome\n\n\n138 patients screened and 80 patients randomised\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nAge: 68 vs 66\nMale: 73% vs 59%\nCaucasian: 93% vs 95%\nAdmitted from\n\nEmergency Room: 22% vs 28%\nWard: 68% vs 69%\n\n\nChronic cardiovascular disease: 63% vs 59%\nChronic respiratory disease: 15% vs 10%\nSOFA score at day of randomisation: 7 vs 7\nVasopressor 24 hours before randomisation: 90% vs 87%\nRRT 24 hours before randomisation: 2% vs 5%\nMechanical ventilation before screening: 12 vs 15 hours\nICU admission before screening: 28 vs 21 hours\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nProstacyclin (n=41)\n\n1 ng/kg/min continuous intravenous infusion for 72-hours\n5 patients discontinued the intervention\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo (n=39)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Number of days alive without mechanical ventilation within 28 days \u2013 no significant difference\n\nComparing intervention vs placebo group\n\nmedian 16 (SD 12) vs 5 days (SD 10)\ndifference: 11 [95% CI -5 to 21]\nP= 0.07\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nNo significant difference in\n\n28 day mortality\n\n21.9% vs 43.6%\nrisk ratio 0.50 [95% CI 0.24-0.96] P=0.06\n\n\n90 day mortality\n\n31.7% vs 48.7%\nrisk ratio 0.65 [95% CI 0.36-1.12], P=0.17\n\n\nMedian days alive and free of renal replacement therapy in the ICU within 28-days\n\n28 days vs 21 days\ndifference: 7 days [95% CI:(0-12)], P=0.06\n\n\nMedian days alive and free of vasopressors in the ICU within 28 days\n\n22 days vs 13 days\ndifference: 9 [95% CI -18 to 1.5], P=0.14\n\n\nSerious adverse events and reactions within 7 days\n\n2.4% vs. 12.8%\nrisk ratio 0.19 [95% CI 0.001 \u2013 1.11], P=0.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nProstacyclin was not associated with a significant improvement in the number of days alive and without mechanical ventilation within 28 days. However, the point estimate favoured prostacyclin and therefore further studies are needed\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nBlinding of all staff including investigators and statistician\nMulti-centre\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAll patients were recruited from the capital of Denmark which may limit the external validity\nThe number of patients that received steroids and IL-6 inhibitors in each group was not reported\nThere were more men in the intervention arm than the control group (73% vs 59%). This baseline imbalance may cause chance bias, as men tend to have worse outcomes from severe COVID disease. An analysis adjusted for baseline imbalance would minimise this bias or alternatively, patients could have been stratified by sex at the time of randomisation. Although, in this particular study, this imbalance would likely strengthen the result\nThe trial was likely underpowered, that is, insufficient individuals were enrolled to draw a meaningful conclusion but, it is certainly hypothesis generating and larger trials are indicated using the data from this study to guide sample size calculation\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with COVID-19 and severe endotheliopathy, the use of prostacyclin was not associated with a significant improvement in the number of days alive and without mechanical ventilation. However, the study was underpowered, and the point estimate for all outcomes favoured the use of prostacyclin, with clinically significant differences reported\nLarger studies and therefore urgently needed to investigate the use of prostacylin for this population\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Prostacyclin in Mechanically Ventilated Patients with COVID-19 and Severe Endotheliopathy: A Multicenter, Randomized, Clinical Trial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 24th November 2021\nPeer-review editor: @celiabradford\nImage by: National Cancer Institute on Unsplash\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
