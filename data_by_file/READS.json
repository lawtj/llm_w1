Critical Care Medicine 2018; published first online: 12 February 2018. doi: 10.1097/CCM.0000000000003000\nClinical Question\n\nFor healthcare professionals interpreting chest radiographs, does an educational intervention compared to no educational intervention improve the diagnosis or exclusion of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\n\nBackground\n\nARDS is common, affecting nearly 25% of mechanically ventilated patients in Critical Care\nThe Berlin Consensus Definition updated the definition of ARDS in 2013 and included the interpretation of a chest radiograph (CXR)\nIt is known that the reliability and consistency of CXR interpretation is poor, and this study attempts to improve that within the context of a large observational study investigating the epidemiology of ARDS: LUNG SAFE\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial using research study coordinators as participants\nParticipants were required to register with the READS website as part of the LUNG SAFE study\nRandomisation took place immediately as part of registration but was concealed from the participant\nConsent was then required, with the opportunity for participants to undergo the LUNG SAFE educational intervention without their data recorded for the READS trial\nInvestigators were blinded to group allocation until statistical analysis was complete\nSubgroups were defined a priori\n\nSetting\n\nThe LUNG SAFE study was conducted in 459 Intensive Care Units across 50 countries\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: registration as study coordinator for the LUNG SAFE study\nExclusion: none\n632 participants screened; 463 were enrolled into this READS substudy (212 intervention arm vs 252 control arm)\nDespite uneven allocation numbers, baseline demographics were well-balanced\n\n80% physicians vs 6% nurses vs 14% \u2018other\u2019\nSpread of experience from < 1 year to > 10 years\nMajority \u2018somewhat familiar or very familiar\u2019 with American-European Consensus Conference definition\nSlightly less familiarity with Berlin definition\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nEducational Intervention\n\nAn educational video created by an experienced educator with expert multimedia skills\nParticipants undertook 11 question test after educational video\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNo Educational Intervention\n\nParticipants undertook 11 question test before being shown same educational video\n\n\n\nCommon to Both Groups\n\nThe test required a decision for 11 CXRs, which have previously been ratified and published by the Berlin Definition group\nParticipants were asked \u201cDoes this chest radiograph have bilateral opacities consistent with pulmonary oedema (may be very mild, patchy and asymmetric) that are not fully explained by pleural effusions, pulmonary nodules or masses, or lobar/lung collapse (i.e., radiographically consistent with the diagnosis or ARDS)?\u201d\nAnswers could be\n\nConsistent\nEquivocal\nInconsistent\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: There was no difference in the mean proportion of correct scores between the groups\n\nIntervention: 58%\nControl: 56%\nMean difference 2%\nP-value: 0.15\n\nBy Student T test comparing two means\nInsufficient data in article to confirm this\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nSensitivity analysis where by the \u201cequivocal\u201d answers were considered with \u201cconsistent\u201d answers resulted in no change to the outcome (70% vs 69% correct; p = 0.72)\nSensitivity analysis where by the \u201cequivocal\u201d answers were considered with \u201cinconsistent\u201d answers changed the significance of the outcome (73% vs 66% correct; p < 0.001)\nSubgroup analyses did not identify any subgroups-intervention interactions\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThis online educational intervention did not improve the accuracy in the identification of ARDS according to radiographic criteria\n\nStrengths\n\nImportant research question set within an important epidemiological study\n\nClinicians must be able to correctly diagnoses ARDS if we are to know the prevalence\n\n\nAppropriate RCT methodology for hypothesis\nGood concealment of allocation\nGood blinding of investigators\nAppropriate statistical tests and sensitivity analysis\n\nWeaknesses\n\nParticipants were recruited from active research community, so may not be representative of broader clinical community\nRandomisation took place before consent was obtained, causing some imbalance in the numbers between the groups\nNo power calculation was conducted\n\nThis was not possible as it was a substudy and the sample population was already defined\n\n\nThe means and standard deviations for the primary outcome have not been published, so independent verification of statistical analysis cannot be performed\nThe 11 test CXRs had been previously published and may have been known to the participants, but this would have biased towards a more accurate outcome in both groups equally\nIt is possible that the test was insufficiently large to draw out any small benefit from the intervention\nIt is possible that the study population was too small to demonstrate any small benefit from the intervention (under-powered)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe ability of clinicians from various backgrounds and years of experience to correctly identify ARDS according to CXRs is extremely poor, bringing the current ARDS definition into question\nAn educational intervention did not improve this\nBetter diagnostic tools for ARDS need to be developed, which may include biomarkers, ultrasound or CT imaging\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0The Randomized Educational Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Diagnosis Study: A Trial to Improve the Radiographic Diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n[further reading]\u00a0ARDS Definitions\u00a0by LITFL\n[further reading]\u00a0LUNG\u00a0SAFE: Large observational study to UNderstand the Global impact of Severe Acute respiratory FailurE\u00a0on ESICM website\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Duncan Chambler\nSummary date: 21 February 2018\nPeer-review editor: Charlotte Summers\n\n\n"
