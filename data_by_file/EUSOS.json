Lancet 2012; 380:1059-65. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61148-9\nClinical Question\n\nWhat is the clinical outcome of patients after major non-cardiac surgery in Europe?\n\nDesign\n\nProspective cohort design\nParticipating hospitals were a voluntary convenience sample\n\nSetting\n\n498 hospitals across 28 European countries (56% university affiliated)\n7 days in April 2011\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: all adults (over 16 years) undergoing elective or non-elective inpatient surgery\nExclusion: day-case surgery; cardiac surgery; neurosurgery; radiological procedures; obstetric procedures\n46,985 patients screened, 46,539 included in analysis (1% removed: duplicate, inconsistent or missing data)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nCrude in-hospital mortality across Europe was 4.0%\nCompared to UK as baseline, four countries had statistically significantly different and unexplained higher rates of mortality:\n\nPoland \u2014 adjusted OR 6.92 (95% CI 2.37\u201320.27); p-value 0.0004\nRomania \u2014 adjusted OR 3.19 (95% CI 1.61\u20136.29); p-value 0.001\nLatvia \u2014 adjusted OR 4.98 (95% CI 1.22\u201320.29); p-value 0.025\nIreland \u2014 adjusted OR 2.61 (95% CI 1.30\u20135.27); p-value 0.007\n\n\nCompared to UK, no country had statistically significantly better rates of mortality, although UK was 10th in rank order\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nHospital stay 3.0 days [IQR 1.0 \u2013 7.0]\nOverall admission rate to ICU was 8%\n\nOf which it was unplanned for 29%\n\nMortality in this unplanned Critical Care cohort was 23% compared to 10% in the planned Critical Care cohort\n\n\nMedian critical care stay was 1.2 days [IQR 0.9 \u2013 3.6]\n\n\nOf all the deaths, 73% of these patients never attended Critical Care\n\nOf the deaths in the cohort that did attend Critical Care, 43% occurred after discharge from Critical Care\n\n\n\n\nIndependent variables associated with increased mortality:\n\nCountry\nUrgency\nGrade of surgery\nSurgical procedure category\nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists physiology score (ASAps)\nMetastatic disease\nCirrhosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of EuSOS Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoropleth map graphically illustrating primary and secondary outcomes by country\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe findings demonstrate that 4% of patients undergoing inpatient surgery die before discharge from hospital, which was higher than expected and varies substantially across Europe.\nThere is a systematic failure in the allocation of Critical Care resources\n\nStrengths\n\nFirst, large, multi-centre, multi-national cohort survey\nOnly small number of cases excluded due to missing data\nOutcomes are comparable to smaller national surveys\n\nWeaknesses\n\nMay not represent true outcomes across Europe, as only based on self-selecting hospitals\nSome countries reported only small numbers of patients, so the described practice and outcomes may not represent national practice\nTrue number of eligible patients not known, as some may not have been reported\nRisk-adjustments made for confounding variables were based upon subjective scores such as ASA and surgical urgency category\nAs a cross-sectional survey, associations and causations are difficult / impossible to conclude with certainty\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis landmark cross-sectional survey demonstrated that in-hospital mortality is higher than perceived, that unexpected variation exists across Europe, and Critical Care is poorly resourced given that many deaths happened in those that did not attend Critical Care or attended as an unplanned admission\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[pubmed]\u00a0Mortality after surgery in Europe: a 7 day cohort study\n[article]\u00a0Mortality after surgery in Europe: a 7 day cohort study\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 19 June 2015\nPeer-review editor: @DavidSlessor\n\n\n"
