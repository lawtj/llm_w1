Chest 2001; 119:867-873\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with septic shock who are mechanically ventilated does indexed LV end-diastolic area or\u00a0respiratory changes in aortic blood velocity predict the haemodynamic effects of volume expansion?\n\nDesign\n\nProspective observational diagnostic study\nPresumed convenience sampling (not stated)\nBlinding not stated\nStatistics\n\nNo sample size calculation performed\nNonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test used to asses the effects of volume expansion on haemodynamic parameters\nNonparametric Mann-Whitney test used to compare haemodynamic parameters prior to volume expansion in responder and non-responder patients\nLinear correlations tested using Spearman rank method\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n2 intensive care units in France (1 university and 1 non-university)\nDates of data collection not stated\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nSeptic shock (defined by 1992 ACCP/SCCM consensus conference)\nHaemodynamic stability (variation in HR and BP of <10% over the 15 minute period before starting the protocol)\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nArrhythmias, PaO2/FiO2 ratio <100mmHg, contraindication to transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE), aortic valvulopathy, LV systolic dysfunction (fractional area of contraction <30%), doppler LV output recordings using transgastric view could not be obtained\n\n\nn=19\n\nAll received inotropic and vasopressor drugs\nTOE performed between 12-72 hours after diagnosis of septic shock\nAll had already received colloids (3\u00b12 L) and/or crystalloids (1\u00b11 L)\n\n\n\nTests of Interest\n\nLV end-diastolic area index (EDAI)\n\nTOE used to obtain a transgastric, short-axis, cross-sectional view of the LV at the mid-papillary muscle level\nEnd-diastole defined as the frame corresponding to the largest LV cross-sectional area immediately after the R-wave peak on the ECG\nThe anterolateral + posteromedial papillary muscles were included within the ventricular area\nLV areas divided by\u00a0body\u00a0surface area (BSA) to obtain EDAI\nUsed mean of 5 measurements performed at the end of expiration\n\n\nRespiratory changes in aortic blood velocity\n\nAortic blood flow measured over single respiratory cycle to allow measurement of peak velocity (Vpeak) and determination of maximum Vpeak values (Vpeakmax) and minimum Vpeak values (Vpeakmin)\nChange in peak velocity (\u0394Vpeak %) = [100 * [Vpeakmax \u2013 Vpeakmin]] / [[Vpeakmax + Vpeakmin]/2]\nMean value of 5 determination used for statistical analysis\n\n\n\nGold standard investigation\n\nCardiac output measurement\n\nUsing TOE, LV outflow tract and ascending aorta imaged when parallel to the ultrasound beam\nAortic blood flow measured by pulse wave-doppler at level of aortic valve\nDiameter of aortic orifice measured at the insertion of the aortic cusp\nAortic valve area = \u03c0 * (aortic diameter/2)\nStroke volume = aortic valve area * the velocity time integral of aortic blood flow\nCardiac output = stroke volume * heart rate\nStroke volume and Cardiac output were divided by the BSA to obtain the stroke volume index and cardiac index\nIf cardiac index increased by \u226515% with fluid challenge classified as responder.

The increase in LV end-diastolic area index with a fluid challenge significantly correlated with the increase in cardiac index; where as the baseline LV end-diastolic area index did not predict if a patient would be fluid responsive.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Free full text]\u00a0Respiratory changes in aortic blood velocity as an indicator of fluid responsiveness in ventilated patients with septic shock\n[further reading]\u00a0Life in the Fast Lane: Fluid responsiveness\n[Further reading]\u00a0ICU Sonography: Tutorial 4 \u2013 Volume status and preload responsiveness assessment\n[Further reading]\u00a0Marik: Echocardiographic Assessment of Preload Responsiveness in Critically Ill Patients\n[Further watching] Ultrasound Podcast: Echo, echo, echo\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: David Slessor\nSummary date: 7th December 2015\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
