Critical Care Medicine 2018; published online doi: 10.1097/CCM.0000000000003132\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill adults, does the administration of ramelteon compared to placebo reduce the length of intensive care stay?\n\nBackground\n\nMelatonin is a hormone excreted by the pineal gland with regulatory effects on circadian rhythm and possibly antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects\nExogenous melatonin has been shown to improve sleep quality and reduce delirium, but little research has been conducted specific to Intensive Care Unit patients\n\nDesign\n\nSingle centre, randomised, controlled trial\nRecruitment by consequetive sampling of admissions to 10 bed emergency medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU)\nRandomisation in 1:1 ratio prepared by \u201can outsider\u201d, stratified by age, APACHE 2 score and intubation status in block sizes of four\nAllocation concealment is not described\nPatients, clinicians and statisticians were all blinded to the allocation\nIntention-to-treat statistical analysis\nPrimary outcome was length of stay (LOS) in ICU\n\nDue to non-normal (right skew) distribution of LOS data, the authors chose to apply log-transformation to approximate a normal distribution\nOnce transformed, Student\u2019s t\u00a0test was used to compare two means\n\n\nPower calculation performed a priori\n\nClinically important reduction in length of stay (LOS) defined as one day\nPower 80% (20% probability of false negative conclusion)\nSignificance level 0.05 (5% probability of false positive conclusion)\nRequired sample size of 182 patients\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre in Nagoya, Japan\n10 bed Emergency and Medical ICU\n\nSurgical ICU separate unit\n\n\nMay 2015 \u2013 April 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adults (\u226520 years); able to recieve medication enterally (oral or via nasogastric tube) during first 48 hours of admission\nExclusion: Withheld consent; allergy to ramelteon; prior administration of ramelteon or fluvoxamine (potential drug interaction)\n98 patients screened; 92 randomised (6 excluded due to lack of consent); 88 included in modified intention-to-treat (4 discharged from ICU without receiving any study drug [2 in each group])\nBaseline demographics were similar \u2013 authors highlighted some imbalances but since P-values were all > 0.05 it is unlikely these differences were due to an improper randomisation process (Ramelteon group vs Control group; * = intentionally balanced through stratification of randomisation)\n\nMedian age*: 68 years vs 68 years\nMean APACHE 2*: 23.98 vs 23.95\nMechanical ventilation*: 40.0% vs 46.5%\nSex: \u2642 73.3% | \u2640 26.7% vs \u2642 55.8% | \u2640 44.2% (P = 0.12)\nExisting dementia: 13.3% vs 2.3% (P = 0.11)\nDiagnosis of sepsis: 26.7% vs 20.9% (P = 0.62)\nHeavy alcohol use:6.7% vs 2.3% (P = 0.62)\nPre-admission psychiatric or sleeping medication: 5.0% vs 7.2% (P = 0.57)\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nRamelteon\n\n8 mg administered at 8pm daily until ICU discharge\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\n1 g lactose powder indistinguishable from study drug administered at 8pm daily until ICU discharge\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nBedside nurses and clinicians were unaware of allocation and encouraged to treat all patients equally\nDelirium prevention was standardised\n\nAvoidance of unnecessary mobilisation\nLimitations to family visits (11am\u201312pm; 3pm\u20134pm)\nLow lighting and sound level after 10pm\n\n\nTreatment of delirium was standardised\n\nPrimarilily using non-pharmacological approach\nEarly mobilisation\nComfortable and sleep-conducive environment\nTreatment of pain, dyspnoea and anxiety\nRisperidone (1 mg) or dexmedetomidine (up to 0.7 ug/kg/hr) at clinicians\u2019 discretion\nHaloperidol 5 mg IV as last resort\n\n\nDecision to discharge from ICU was made by a multidisciplinary group at a twice daily meeting based upon:\n\nNo / minimal sedation required\nOxygen saturation > 90% requiring less than FiO2 0.5\nNo mechanical ventilation\nNo / minimal inotropic or vasopressor support\nUrine output > 0.5 ml/kg/hr\nNo need for renal replacement therapy\n\n\nDelirium assessed using CAM-ICU\nSedation level assessed using Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: duration of intensive care length of stay was shorter in the Ramelteon group compared to the Placebo group\n\nRamelteon group: median 4.56 days (range 2.10 \u2013 7.07)\nPlacebo group: median 5.86 days (range 2.97 \u2013 14.16)\nMedian difference: 1.3 days\nP-value (after log-transformation) = 0.082\nAfter a pre-specified multivariate analysis, administration of Ramelteon was independently associated with a statistically significant reduction in length of stay\n\nP-value = 0.028\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nDelirium occurred less frequently in the Ramelteon group\n\nRamelteon 24.4% vs Placebo 46.5%\nOR: 2.69 (95% CI 1.09 to 6.65; P = 0.044)\nARR: 22.07% (95% CI\u00a02.58% to 41.56%)\nNNT: 5\nFragility Index: 1\n\n\nDuration of delirium was shorter in the Ramelteon group\n\nMean 0.78 days vs 1.40 days (P = 0.048)\n\n\nIn-ICU mortality did not differ between the groups\n\nRamelteon 6.7% vs Placebo 7.5%\nARR: 0.31% (95% CI -10.23% to 10.85%; P = 1.0)\n\n\nQuality of sleep was better in the Ramelteon group\n\nFewer awakenings per night (0.8 awakenings vs 1.31 awakenings; P = 0.045)\nMore nights without awakenings (51% vs 30%; P = 0.048)\nNo difference in mean hours of sleep (7.29 hrs vs 6.78 hrs; P = 0.252)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAdministration of Ramelteon to ICU patients was associated with a \u201ctendency toward a decreased duration of ICU stay\u201d, and a decrease in the incidence and duration of delirium that reached statistical significance\n\nStrengths\n\nSensible theory and testable hypothesis\nAppropriate outcome measure relevant to hospital resource use and patients, investigating the overall multi-modal effect of melatonin-receptor agonism\nBalanced baseline variables suggest the randomisation process was unbiased, despite the concerns about sequence generation and allocation concealment described as weaknesses below\nGood blinding of all relevant individuals\nPrimary outcome was guided by criteria and multidisciplinary input to reduce subjectivity\nStatistical manipulation and analysis was appropriate to the data type\nClinically important difference was defined a priori\n\nWeaknesses\n\nMassive under-recruitment has reduced the statistical power of the conclusion of this trial\n\nA false negative conclusion may have been drawn\nThe manuscript reports that fewer patients than expected met the inclusion criteria\nThe number of patients screened and the reasons for not meeting the inclusion criteria are not provided\n\n\nMethod for construction of randomisation sequence is not clearly defined\n\nWas it computer generated or was a simpler but possibly biased method used?\n\n\nConcealment of allocation not described\n\nWas the randomisation sequence hidden adequately prior to patient allocation?\n\n\nMaintenance of allocation not reported\n\nDid all patients receive intended drug and were they otherwise treated the same?\n\n\nSingle centre and medical only ICU design may limit the external generalisability beyond the scope of medical emergencies in Japan\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis is a promising trial that adds to the growing evidence of benefit from administration of melatonin and melatonin-receptor agonists\nDespite concern about some of the methods, the overall conduct of this trial is good and I believe the internal validity is good enough to accept the results as accurate\nHowever, the small sample size and single centre design limits the generalisability and I shall await larger trials before recommending melatonin or ramelteon to all critically ill patients\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of Administration of Ramelteon, a Melatonin Receptor Agonist, on the Duration of Stay in the ICU\n[further reading]\u00a0Sleep and ICU\u00a0by LITFL\n[further reading]\u00a0Simons (Light and ICU Delirium)\u00a0by The Bottom Line\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Duncan Chambler\nSummary date: 11 April 2018\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0Adrian Wong\n\n\n"
