NEJM July 16 2020 doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2000741\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury, does accelerated initiation of renal replacement therapy compared to standard initiation improve 90 day survival?\n\nBackground\n\nAcute Kidney Injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and some case series suggest up to 2/3rds of ICU patients develop some degree of renal impairment. Up to 50% of these patients may need dialysis which increases the complexity and cost of the care of the critically ill. Patients with critical illness and AKI have a high mortality.\nThe purported rationale for early dialysis include: achieving optimal fluid balance via ultrafiltration, removal of toxic solutes that may mitigate the inflammatory milieu and correcting metabolic acidosis that may contribute to haemodynamic instability\nThe purported rationale for delaying dialysis include: less procedural related risk to the patient, avoidance in some situations of an unnecessary intervention if the patient\u2019s renal function improves spontaneously, resource rationing and avoidance of iatrogenic hypovolaemia from excessive ultrafiltration.\nPreviously, there have been several trials conducted exploring the optimal timing of renal replacement therapy.\n\nThe AKIKI trial looked at a predominantly medical cohort of patients with AKI & consequent metabolic derangement, and randomised them to early or late dialysis. At Day 60, there was no difference in mortality. Patients in this trial could receive intermittent or continuous dialysis.\nThe ELAIN trial looked at a predominantly surgical cohort of patients with AKI (KDIGO stage 3) and randomised to early or late dialysis. The hazard ratio of death at day 90 was 0.66 in favour of the early initiation strategy (95% CI 0.45 to 0.97; p-value = 0.03). However, the fragility of this trial was 3.\nThe IDEAL trial studied patients with septic shock and acute kidney injury. This randomised controlled trial that was stopped early due to futility, found no difference in mortality with the use of early vs. delayed renal replacement therapy\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nThe STARRT-AKI trial (STandard versus\u00a0Accelerated Initiation of\u00a0Renal\u00a0Replacement\u00a0Therapy in Acute Kidney\u00a0Injury trial)\nOpen-labeled\nRandomised controlled trial. Participants were randomised 1:1 to accelerated versus standard initiation of RRT\nVariable block sizes and stratified to centre\nAllocation concealment via a web-based randomisation system\nTrial protocol and statistical analysis plan published prior to publication\nThe trial was powered at 90% to detect an absolute difference of 6% between groups, based on a 90-day mortality of 40% in the standard group. Given this, the sample size was calculated at 2866 patients and increased to 3000 to account for attrition, eg loss to follow-up\nPre-specified subgroups were patient sex, eGFR, surgical patients, geographical region, septic patients, SAP II score\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient or substitute decision maker in keeping with the individual institutional standards\n\nSetting\n\nMulti-national: 15 countries\nMulti-centre: 168 sites\nPatients were randomised from October 2015 to September 2019\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n>18 years\nAdmission to an ICU\nAKI defined as Cr>100umol/L in women and Cr>130umol/L in men and had not declined by >27umol/l in 48 hours\nEvidence of severe AKI with at least 1 of the following 3:\n\n> 2-fold increase in creatinine from baseline\nCr >354umol/L and >27umol/L above baseline creatinine\nUrine output <6ml/kg in 12 hours\n\n\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nK >5.5mmol/L\nHCO3 <15mmol/L\nA drug overdose that necessitated dialysis\nLack of commitment to provide RRT due to treatment limitations\nAny RRT in last 2 months\nKidney transplant in last year\nKnown pre-hospital ESRF with eGRF <20ml/min/1.73m2\nPresence of renal obstruction, rapidly progressive GN, vasculitis, thrombotic microangiopathy or AIN\n\n\nOnce all inclusion and no exclusion criteria were met the patient could be randomised to the trial providing there was true clinician equipoise, ie it was not felt that immediate RRT was mandated or that deferred RRT was mandated. More than 7000 patients were excluded at this point due to lack of equipoise\nOnce all inclusion and no exclusion criteria were met this marked a time point and consent needed to be obtained within 12 hours. Randomisation to the accelerated or standard arm then occurred.\n3021 patients:1512 to accelerated arm, 1507 to standard arm\n2927 patients; 1465 and 1462 patients were analysed for the primary outcome (modified intention-to-treat-analysis) as a total of 42 patients were either lost to follow up or withdrew consent.\nThe baseline characteristics were similar between groups with 75% of patients mechanically ventilated and the mean Creatinine at randomisation 300umol/L\n\nIntervention\n\nPatients randomised to the accelerated arm needed to commence continuous renal replacement therapy within 12 hours of randomisation\n\n96.8% received dialysis\nThe average time to commencement was 6 hours\nThe average creatinine at time of commencement was 327umol/L and fluid balance positive 2714ml\n\n\n\nControl\n\nClinicians caring for patients randomised to the standard group were discouraged from commencing RRT unless:\n\nPersistent AKI, with Cr >50% the value recorded at randomisation\n\n\nAND one or more of:\n\n\nK+>6mmol/L\npH < 7.2 or HCO3 <12mmol/L\nFluid overload causing respiratory compromise (PaO2/FiO2<200)\nPersistent AKI for >72 hours from randomisation\n\n\nThere was no obligation to commence RRT in the standard group arm even if the above criteria were met, eg if K is 6.3mmol/L, the clinician could manage it with medical therapy. Conversely, RRT could be commenced at any time deemed suitable based on the judgement of the attending clinician\n61.8% of patients in the standard group received dialysis\nThe average creatinine at the time of RRT commencement was 433umol/L and fluid balance positive 5893ml\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nThe modality of RRT was at the discretion of the treating physician (there were guidelines provided): Comparing the accelerated vs standard groups, most received continuous RRT (68.4% vs 70.6%), then IHD (27% vs 25.3%), then SLED (4.6% vs 4.1%)\nCitrate was the most common form of circuit anticoagulation\nRRT would continue until one of the following was encountered\n\nDeath\nWithdrawal of life-support\nKidney Function Recovered\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: 90 Day Mortality (Accelerated vs Standard)\n\nNO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE 643/1465 (43.9%) vs 639/1462 (43.7%) RR= 1, (95% CI 0.93-1.09), p=0.92 (modified ITT analysis)\nAdjusted OR 1.05 (95% CI 0.9-1.23) [This took into account baseline characteristics of the patients]\n\n\nSecondary outcome: (Accelerated vs Standard) included:\n\nSignificant difference in:\n\nDependence on RRT at Day 90 after randomisation (10.4% vs 6%), RR 1.74 (95% CI 1.24-2.43)\nPatients in the accelerated group had a shorter ICU stay than the standard group (9 days vs 10 days)\n\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nComposite of all cause mortality and RRT dependence at D90\nMajor adverse kidney event (composite of death, RRT dependence or sustained reduction in kidney function)\neGFR at D90\nAlbuminuria at D90\nMortality in ICU, D28, hospital\nRRT free days at D90\nMechanical ventilation free days at D28\nVasoactive therapy-free days through D28\n\n\n\n\nSub-groups: there was no significant difference in any of the pre-specified subgroups\nAdverse events were more common in the accelerated arm (23% v 16.5%), particularly hypotension and hypophosphataemia\nSerious adverse events were not significantly different (1% vs 0.5%)\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury, an accelerated strategy for the initiation of renal-replacement therapy did not result in a lower mortality at 90 days than a standard strategy\n\nStrengths\n\nAllocation concealment, intention to treat analysis, blinding of outcome assessors, near-complete follow-up (internal validity)\nStratification by centre and allocation in variable block size (allowing the clinician to have little chance of predicting the allocation prior to randomisation)\nPatients were analysed by the group they were allocated to even thought there was a 7.5% cross-over in therapies between groups\nPragmatic design which reflects the real world: if the clinician did not have absolute equipoise regarding providing accelerated or standard provision of RRT then they were not included in the trial\nClinically meaningful outcomes\nThe funding organisations and partners were not involved in the design, implementation, management of the trial, analysis of data or publication\nThe trial results are widely applicable as patients were recruited from many different ICUs in many different countries (external validity)\nThere was a clear differentiation between groups in term of creatinine and fluid balance at the time of RRT commencement\nThere were 3 interim analyses conducted to confirm that continuation of the trial was safe\n\nWeaknesses\n\nEquipoise is difficult to define: it would be useful to see the data on the patients whom were excluded because the treating clinician felt accelerated or delayed RRT was mandated\nIt will be interesting to see the planned economic analysis of STARRT-AKI\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThere appears to be no benefit in starting renal replacement in an accelerated fashion\nIn addition early dialysis appears to increase the risk of dependence on long term renal replacement therapy raising the possibility these patients are of risk of\u00a0 dialysis induced kidney injury\n\nExternal Links\n\nSTARRT-AKI\nTrial Protocol\nStatistical Analysis Plan\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford\nSummary date: 15/7/20\nPeer-review editor: Adrian Wong\n\n\n"
