NEJM 2022 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2207304\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with refractory VF, does Double Sequential External Defibrillation or Vector-change Defibrillation compared to standard defibrillation improve survival to hospital discharge?\n\nBackground\n\nRefractory VF occurs in up to half of patients following an out-of-hospital VF arrest\nAnti-arrhythmics are commonly used in this setting. However the ALPS study reported no significant improvement in survival to discharge or good neurological outcome with the use of either amiodarone or lignocaine\nCase series have suggested a potential benefit with the use of\u00a0Double Sequential External Defibrillation or Vector-change defibrillation to treat patients with refractory VF. These strategies may enable a greater or different part of the ventricle to be defibrillated\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n3 group cluster randomisation with cross-over\nEach cluster crossed over every 6 months\nRandomisation performed at level of paramedic service\nRandom treatment sequences were computer-generated\nPower calculation: 930 patients would provide 80% power to detect an 8% absolute improvement in the primary outcome from a baseline of 12%, with a false positive rate of 5%\nTrial terminated early by data and safety monitoring board due to paramedic staffing shortages affecting timely delivery of assigned defibrillation strategy\nIntention to treat analysis used for primary analysis\nTreatment received analysis also reported\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\nBlinding of outcome assessors\nOutcomes assessed until hospital discharge\n\nSetting\n\n6 paramedic services, Ontario, Canada, included ~4000 paramedics\nData collection:\n\nPilot trial: March 2018 \u2013 September 2019 (n=152) \u2013 results also included in this analysis\nPlanned trial: September 2019 \u2013 May 2022 (n=253)\nStudy paused April \u2013 September 2020 due to COVID pandemic\n\n\n\n\nInclusion:\n\n\u226518 years\nOut-of-hospital-VF arrest of presumed cardiac cause\nRefractory VF\n\nDefined as initial presenting rhythm of VF/VT that was still present after 3 consecutive rhythm checks and standard defibrillations\n\n\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nNon-VF/VT as presenting rhythm\nNon-cardiac cause\nTraumatic cardiac arrest, drowning, hypothermia, hanging, or suspected drug overdose\nDNAR order\nPatients initially treated by non-participating fire or EMS agencies\n\n\n405 patients randomised\nComparing baseline characteristics of standard vs. VC vs. DSED groups\n\nAge: 64 vs. 64 vs. 63\nMale: 80% vs. 88% vs. 85%\nBystander witnessed cardiac arrest: 60% vs. 76% vs. 66%\nBystander CPR: 54% vs. 63% vs. 57%\nMedian response time: 7.4 vs. 7.4 vs. 7.8min\nMedian time from initial call to 1st shock: 10 vs. 10 vs. 10min\nPre-hospital intubation: 38% vs 50% vs 42%\nAnti-arrhythmic dose administered: 81% vs. 74% vs. 74%\nAdrenaline administered: 95% vs. 92% vs. 86%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nPatients randomised to either:\n\nVector-change (VC) Defibrillation\n\nAll subsequent defibrillations performed with Anterior-Posterior pad placement\n144 patients assigned to VC defibrillation\n\n113 patients received VC defibrillation\n31 patients received standard defibrillation\n\n\n\n\nDouble Sequential External Defibrillation (DSED)\n\nAll subsequent shocks performed using DSED\n2nd defibrillator attached in AP position.

There were a low number of outcome events. Both of these are likely to result in an overestimate of the effect size being reported\nOutcomes assessed only until hospital discharge. For neurological outcomes longer follow up may be beneficial\nDSED requires 2 defibrillators. It is unclear if this meant that more paramedics were called to cardiac arrests when DSED were used. If so this may introduce bias\nResults from pilot trial were included in this analysis. This was not planned for in the trial registration on clinicaltrial.gov\nThe median time from initial call to 1st shock was 10 minutes. These results may not be generalisable to setting that do not achieve this\nThere are some baseline differences between the treatment groups that may lead to confounding bias\nThere were differences in the amount of crossovers between services, suggesting that bias from individual treating services may not have been completely eliminated\nBlinding of treatment was not possible\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn this randomised trial of patients with refractory VF following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the use of DSED or VC defibrillation resulted in significantly higher survival to hospital discharge. The use of DSED was also reported to lead to a significant increase in survival with a good neurological outcome\nThese results should be interpreted with caution as\n\nThe trial was stopped early and there were a low number of outcome effects, and therefore the effect size is likely to be overestimated\nThe analysis using treatment received reported no significant difference in the primary outcome\n\n\nFurther trials should therefore be performed. In the mean time, if you are unable to randomise a patient to a trial, the use of DSED or VC defibrillation would be a reasonable treatment option to try for refractory VF, with the knowledge that the research is not definitive and the outcome benefits are unclear\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle:\u00a0Defibrillation Strategies for Refractory Ventricular Fibrillation\nEditorial: Defibrillation after cardiac arrest- is it time to change practice?\nfurther reading:\u00a0first10EM: Dose VF: A double sequential defibrillation game changer?\nfurther reading:\u00a0REBELEM: The DOSE VF Pilot RCT: Double Sequential External Defibrillation for Refractory Ventricular Fibrillation\nFurther reading: St Emlyns JC- Alternative defibrillation strategies in refractory VF.
