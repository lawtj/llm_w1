JAMA 2017; 318(15):1450-1459. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.13889\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients aged over 75 years, does a recommendation for systematic ICU admission compared with standard care reduce 6 month mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nThe ageing population has led to an increased demand for both hospital admissions and intensive care admissions. Elderly patients are more commonly affected by multiple co-morbidities, frailty and have reduced physiological reserve. It is unclear if ICU admissions benefit this population as observational trials have reported mixed results and there have been no previous randomised controlled trials.\n\nDesign\n\nCluster randomised controlled trial\nComputer generated randomisation\nStratified by median number of emergency department visits, presence/absence of geriatric ward, and geographical area\n6 month follow up period. For patients discharged alive, outcomes assessed by telephone follow up with patients, relatives, general practioners or appropriate legal institutions\nStatistical analysis\n\nSample size calculation:2802 patients required to have 74% power to detect a 6% difference in mortality rates from a baseline of 32% and an estimated intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.01, with a 2-sided alpha of 0.05. Number of hospital participating in study increased from 20 to 24, therefore planned sample size increased to 3000 patients\nBi-variable associations evaluated using t test for continuous variables and the\u00a0\u03c72 or Fisher exact test for categorical variables\nBinary outcomes analysed using logistic regression models\nCrude overall survival at 6 months estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared with log-rank test\n6-month survival adjusted for baseline characteristics estimated using Cox model\nIntention to treat analysis\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n24 hospitals in France, both academic and non-academic with at least 1 emergency department (ED) and one ICU\nData collected: January 2012 \u2013 November 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAge >=75 years presenting to the ED\nPredefined critical condition that potentially require organ support\nHad preserved functional status (Index of Independance in Activities of Daily Living score of >=4 or not evaluable)\nPreserved nutritional status (absence of cachexia, subjectively assessed by physician at the bedside)\nFree of active cancer (patients in whom cancer was diagnosed after inclusion remained in the statistical analysis)\n\n\nExclusion: ED stay of > 24 hours, secondary referral to the ED, refusal to participate\n3037 patients randomised\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control groups \u2013\u00a0Patients in the intervention group had a higher recruiting rate and a higher severity of illness\n\nRecruitment continued for 22.5 vs. 28.5 months\nHospital included: 11 vs. 13\nMean number of ED visits during study period: 12,746 vs. 16,580\nGeriatric ward in the hospital: 10 vs. 11\nAcademic hospital: 7 vs. 10\nMedical ICU: 5 vs. 7\nPatients included: 1518 vs. 1518\nMedian age (IQR): 85 (81-89) vs. 85 (81-89)\nCo-existing conditions\n\nIschaemic heart disease or hypertension: 41% vs. 42%\nRespiratory disorder: 30% vs. 31%\nCongestive heart failure: 15% vs. 11%, p=0.04\nCognitive impairment: 10% vs. 14%, p=0.06\n\n\nMedian SAPS 3 score at enrollement: 64 vs. 59, p<0.01\nSeniority of ED physician >=2 years: 58% vs. 74%, p<0.001\nInitial clinical diagnosis, p<0.01\n\nRespiratory failure: 32% vs. 32%\nAcute respiratory failure requiring intubation: 4% vs. 2%\nCardiac disorder: 12% vs. 15%\nShock: 21% vs. 16%\nComa: 12% vs. 9%\n\n\nLiving situation, p=0.01\n\nHome without assistance: 71% vs. 65%\nNursing home/long-term care facility/hospital: 13% vs. 14%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nProgramme to promote ICU admission\n\nED & ICU physicians asked to systematically recommend an ICU admission for all included patients during trial period\nED physician required to systematically call the attending ICU physician;

In-hospital mortality was significantly increased in the intervention group. Potential reasons for this include differences in baseline characteristics, methodological weaknesses, or harm resulting from ICU care.\nDue to the differences in baseline characteristics and methodological weaknesses this paper should not change current practice but highlights the importance of thinking about whether an ICU admission will actually benefit or potentially harm the patient in front of you.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of Systematic Intensive Care Unit Triage on Long-term Mortality Among Critically Ill Elderly Patients in France: A Randomized Clinical Trial\n[further watching]\u00a0ESICM Presentation\n[further watching]\u00a0Interview with author\n[further reading]\u00a0Attitudes of physicians towards the care of critically ill elderly patients \u2013 a European survey\n[further reading]\u00a0The impact of frailty on ICU and 30-day mortality and the level of care in very elderly patients (\u2265 80 years)\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 30th October 2017\nPeer-review editor: Adrian Wong\n\n\n"
