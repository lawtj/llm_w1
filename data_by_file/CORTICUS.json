N Engl J Med 2008; 358:111-24.\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients with severe septic shock, does hydrocortisone versus placebo reduce mortality at 28 days?\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, randomised controlled trial\nDouble-blinded\nComputer generated, block randomisation stratified by study centre.\nAll patients had short corticotropin test to identify \u201cresponders\u201d from \u201cnon-responders\u201d for a priori\u00a0sub-group analysis.\nAdverse events data collected for safety analysis at blinded interim intervals.\nPower calculation: if 40% included were \u201cnon-responders\u201d with a baseline 28-day mortality of 50%, then 400 patients per arm were required to detect 10% absolute reduction in mortality with 80% power and 5% accepted type 1 error.\n\nSetting\n\n52 participating ICUs\nMarch 2002 to November 2005\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: adults with severe sepsis, with all of the following:\n\nclinical evidence of infection;\nsystemic response to inflammation;\nshock (systolic BP < 90 mmHg despite 1 hour fluid resuscitation or the need for vasopressors);\norgan dysfunction attributable to shock.\n\n\nExclusion: chronic steroids within 6 months; acute steroids within 4 weeks; immunosupression; \u00a0less than 24 survival expectation\n499 patients recruited\n\nIntervention\n\nHydrocortisone given as 50 mg in 6-hourly boluses\n\nTapering regime from day 6. Stopped on day 12.\n\n\n\nControl\n\nIdentical placebo prepared and administered in an identical way to intervention.\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: no difference in 28-day mortality in short corticotropin non-responders (i.e. the sub-group that were more likely to benefit from exogenous corticosteroids)\n\n39.2% in hydrocortisone group vs. 36.1% in placebo group\nAbsolute difference 3.1% (95% C.I. -9.5% to 15.7%) favouring placebo.\np=0.69\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nNo difference in 28-day mortality in short corticotropin responders (i.e. the sub-group that were less likely to benefit from exogenous corticosteroids)\n\n28.8% vs. 28.7%, P=1.0\n\n\nNo difference in 28-day mortality in all patients\n\n34.3% vs. 31.5%, P=0.51\n\n\nStatistically significant reduction in the time to reversal of shock favouring the hydrocortisone group (seen in responders, non-responders and all patient groups).\n\nmedian time until reversal of shock, in all patients, was 3.3 days (95% C.I. 2.9-3.9) in the hydrocortisone group vs. 5.8 days (95% C.I. 5.2-6.9) in the placebo group\n\n\nNon-significant increase in rate of superinfections in hydrocortisone vs. placebo group\n\n33% vs. 26%, RR 1.27 (95% C.I. 0.96-1.68)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe use of hydrocortisone did not decrease mortality in a general population of patients with septic shock, even though the drug hastened reversal of shock\n\nStrengths\n\nExcellent randomisation and blinding methodology\nSensible primary outcome, and useful secondard outcomes\nFair commentary of problems by authors in \u2018Discussion\u2019 section of paper\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDespite 52 ICUs, this study failed to recruit required numbers (average of less than 10 patients per ICU over 3 years) despite common incidence of severe sepsis.\nActually mortality (~38%) was much lower than estimated mortality used for power calculation (50%)\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study did not demonstrate survival benefit from administering hydrocortisone to adult patients with severe septic shock. It may lead to harm from superinfection. It does lead to reversal of shock quicker than placebo.\nBased on this study alone, hydrocortisone should not be routinely given to adult patients with severe septic shock.\nIt may be worth considering when all else has failed.\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf / abstract / doi:\u00a010.1056/NEJMoa071366\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\nThe ADRENAL study: a trial of corticosteroids in patients with sepsis, aiming to recruit 3,800 patients to answer this same clinical question.\nMason et al.
