One of the purported benefits of VHA is their timeliness to provide results which can be actioned\n\n\nDespite being major trauma centres most did not have VHA guided transfusion at the time of study initiation\n\nWould it be more likely to see benefits with VHA use in centres where VHA use was already widely used, and staff used to using the treatment algorithms?\n\n\nAs mentioned, this trial provides valid and useful evidence to an area with limited randomised research. However, I feel the use of an augmented protocol in this trial raises some interesting considerations before one can conclude that there is no role for VHA use in traumatic haemorrhage (the authors do not draw this conclusion)\n\nThese are not criticisms per se but more some consideration surrounding how VHA were used in this trial\n\nThese maybe a reflection of\u00a0 pre existing biases but regardless any discussion generated is important\n\n\nWould it have been better to compare a stepwise VHA guided algorithm to conventional CCT and empiric treatment approach?\n\n1:1:1 replacement as per in this trial may have given products to patients that a VHA may have shown unnecessary\nThe lack of a step-wise, sequential VHA algorithm may again result in some products that were given that may not have been required\n\ni.e. if fibrinogen was replaced as the first step, then this may have been sufficient and thus result in no requirement for FFP and platelets\nExamples of sequential ROTEM algorithms are the Gold Coast University Hospital algorithm (this isn\u2019t open access so the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital MHP is similar but for all critical bleeding)\n\n\nHypothetically, the administration of products in 1:1:1 ratios in both arms and the lack of a sequential VHA algorithm might mask some of the benefits shown in other VHA trials. Whilst fully acknowledging that this trial provides some of the highest quality evidence on VHA use in trauma, if some of these blood products were not have required, this could lead to greater divergence in blood product replacement between groups\n\nThis potentially may show some benefit of VHA use with regards to patient focused outcomes\n\n\nVHA would need to be repeated 10 minutes after any treatment to enable an assessment of response and promptly guide further blood product replacement with the lack of empiric treatment being given\n\nIn this study the chosen point to repeat VHA / CCT was after every 4 units of PRBC given (of which there is no median time provided for how long this period of time was)\nHowever, the rationale that it is an easy interval to track is logical and using a target such as this enables standardization in both arms. Otherwise there would be an increase in VHA compared to CCT, which no doubt would also be viewed as a flaw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn adult trauma patients presenting with signs of haemorrhagic shock, this trial did not show benefit of viscoelastic haemostatic assay augmented protocols when compared to conventional coagulation tests augmented protocols\nThis is a well done, pragmatic trial set out to try and address an area with limited randomised research however given my reservations above, and some of the trends shown, further studies would be warranted before concluding that VHA has no place in the management of bleeding trauma patients\n\nExamples of\u00a0 further work could include the use of a stepwise sequential protocol, having trauma induced coagulopathy as an inclusion criteria, and the use in TBI\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n[abstract]\u00a0Viscoelastic haemostatic assay augmented protocols for major trauma haemorrhage (ITACTIC): a randomized, controlled trial\n[further reading] The use of viscoelastic haemostatic assays in the management of major bleeding: A British Society for Haematology Guideline\n[further reading]\u00a0LITFL: Thromboelastogram (TEG)\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker (@hgmwalker89)\nSummary date: 15th October 2020\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\n\n\n"
