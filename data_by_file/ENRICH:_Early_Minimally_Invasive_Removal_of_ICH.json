NEJM 2024; DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2308440\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), does the use of early minimally invasive surgery + standard management compared to standard management alone, result in better functional outcomes at 180 days?\n\nBackground\n\nSpontaneous ICH is a condition with high mortality, poor functional outcomes in survivors and high costs of care\nThe mainstay of standard medical management for ICH has been reversal of coagulopathy, blood pressure control and best supportive care\nWhile showing mortality benefit, surgical intervention with craniectomy (STITCH, STITCH II) and minimally invasive techniques (MISTIE III) has failed to show long term benefits in functional outcomes\nData from these trials showed a trend towards benefit with early surgical intervention in superficial lesions and with greater clot evacuation\nThe ENRICH trial was designed to investigate any benefit of early minimally invasive surgery trans-sulcal parafascicular surgery (MIPS) in superficial ICH\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, two-arm, randomised, adaptive design\n1:1 block randomization stratified by:\n\nICH location (anterior basal ganglia vs lobar)\nIndex GCS (<9 or \u2265 9)\n\n\nSubjects followed to 6 months or until death\nUtility weighted mRS used:\n\nWeights of 1.0, 0.91, 0.76, 0.65, 0.33, 0.0, and 0.0 were applied to the 7 levels from mRS 0 (best) to 6 (worst) respectively\n\nThis means there are unequal gaps between different levels e.g. severe disability and death (mRS 5 and 6) are scored the same, but there is a 0.15 difference between mRS 2 and 3\n\n\n\n\nPlanned adaptive sample size 150 \u2013 300 patients\nAdaptive design allowing longitudinal modelling for interim decision to predict 180-day outcome using 90-day mRS\n\nInterim analysis at 150 patients and then in blocks of 25 to determine if early stopping rules are met:\n\nIf accrual stopped due to futility in one site (anterior basal ganglia or lobar) then this would lead to enrichment for the other site\n\n\nPre-specified stopping rules for both futility and success\nPrimary outcome defined as between group mean differences in utility weighted mRS (H1: \u0394> 0)\n\nTo demonstrate superiority, a Bayesian model-based posterior probability of MIPS benefit (i.e., \u0394> 0) was set to be \u22650.975\n\n\nNon-informative prior used for Bayesian analyses\nFormal statistical consulting service (Berry Consultants) used\n\n\nScores on mRS obtained by site personnel with structured interviews with patients and caregivers\n\nIn order to mask primary endpoint audio-recordings were uploaded with redaction of any information about group assignment and reviewed by a blinded neuropsychologist\n\n\nWritten consent obtained prior to enrolment\n\nSetting\n\nDecember 2016 \u2013 August 2022\n37 hospitals in the USA\n\n59 treating Neurosurgeons\n\n\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAged 18 \u2013 80\nAcute spontaneous, primary ICH with

Conclusions\n\nAmong patients in whom surgery could be performed within 24 hours after an acute ICH, minimally invasive hematoma evacuation resulted in better functional outcomes at 180 days than those with guideline-based medical management. The effect of surgery appeared to be attributable to intervention for lobar haemorrhages.\n\nStrengths\n\nThe rationale for the study was sound and guided by evidence and trends displayed in previous trials\nPrimary endpoint of functional outcome is a patient centred and meaningful outcome\nBalanced baseline characteristics for the intervention and control\nMulti-centre and randomised\nMinimal loss to follow up (8/300)\nEfforts to minimise bias associated with subjective reporting of mRS by including caregivers in assessment and having blinded review of the assessment by a neuropsychologist\nSuccess/safety of surgical intervention in terms of reduction in haematoma volume and low rate of rebleeding\nPre published statistical analysis plan\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSome limitations to external validity:\n\nSingle country\nStrict exclusion criteria \u2013 very specific population in terms of ICH size and location\n\n\nUtility weighted mRS may be more patient centric given public perceptions of neurological outcomes have been shown to be non-linear with unequal gaps between health states. However:\n\nThe weights chosen have potential to alter outcome\nNot validated in this cohort of patients\n\n\nData collection around adverse events (Table S12) is very broad and range from subjective outcomes like \u201cflu-like symptoms\u201d and \u201cpalpitations\u201d through to asystole\n\nWhilst data collection around adverse events is important in novel interventions, the sheer number of events collected may confound the interpretation of the reported adverse event rate\n\n\nHigh rates of decompressive craniectomy in the control group \u2013 this is a procedure that has been shown to increase survival but with high rates of poor functional outcomes\nSponsorship by NICO, the manufacture of the devices used in the trial, although no incentives provided, no involvement in data collection, analysis or trial design\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile it represents a fractionally small population of ICH, the benefit associated with the intervention for lobar haemorrhage is functionally important\nDecisions around surgical intervention should be based on multi-disciplinary discussions with neurosurgical specialists\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Trial of Early Minimally Invasive Removal of Intracerebral Hemorrhage\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Mitch Pincus\nSummary date: 25th May 2024\nPeer-review editor: George Walker\nPicture by: Katrin Bolovtsova / Pexels\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
