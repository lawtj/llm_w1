JAMA Neurology 2020; 77(10):1225-1232. doi:10.1001/jamaneurol.2020.2264\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients with acute altered level of consciousness and no recent seizures, does continuous EEG (cEEG) compared to repeated routine EEG (rEEG) correlate with reduced mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nEEG is emerging in critical care for its use in detecting convulsive and non clinical (non convulsive) seizures, status epilepticus (SE), monitoring sedation and anaesthesia, and its use in prognostication post out of hospital cardiac arrest\nThe European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society guidelines suggest cEEG for critically ill patients with altered consciousness\nThis recommendation is based on low quality evidence from 2 retrospective observational trials, based on discharge diagnosis, which suggest that cEEG compared to rEEG is associated lower mortality, albeit at significantly greater cost and hospital length of stay in the cEEG group\nHigh burden of seizures has been shown to be associated with worse short and long term outcome in critically ill patients\nIt is yet to be demonstrated that increased identification of seizures leads to improvement in outcome\nThis is the first randomised trial to compare cEEG to rEEG\n\nDesign\n\nMulticentre randomised controlled trial\n1:1 randomisation through an online program stratified by site\nBedside clinicians were not blinded to patient allocation\n\nOutcome assessors were blinded\n\n\nPatients were recruited during local investigators\u2019 availability (working hours, not on weekends)\nProtocolled intervention was stopped in patients diagnosed as having seizures or SE during the study period to allow conversion to cEEG if treatment required\nEEG results were communicated to treating teams within 2 hours of EEG start, at least 3 (working days) or 2 times per day (weekends, holidays)\nPrimary outcome was mortality at 6 months\nSecondary outcomes were based on intention to monitor\nPower calculation was based on previously available data from one North American Study\n2x 174 patients were required to achieve 80% power with 0.05 alpha error to detect a survival difference of 14% in patients undergoing cEEG compared to rEEG\n\nSetting\n\nSwitzerland (4 centres)\nEnrolment from April 2017- November 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Patients in intensive or intermediate care units with GCS \u226411 or FOUR score \u226412 of any aetiology, referred from the treating team for EEG\nExclusion: Patients with recent seizures (36hours) or SE(96 hours) prior to randomisation, patients in palliative care, and those having invasive procedures within 48hours\n402 patients recruited\nWell matched baseline demographics; age, gender\nGroups differed with respect to cause of altered consciousness\n\nrEEG group tended to have a lower burden of comorbidities, less prevalent hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy and brain trauma, and more prevalent ischaemic stroke, toxic metabolic disorders and other conditions\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of routine vs continuous groups\n\nAge: 64 vs 64\nFemale: 33% vs 34%\nReason of admission\n\nBrain injury (including cardiac arrest): 56% vs 62%\nMedical: 33% vs 24%\nSurgical: 9% vs 12%\n\n\nPrevious seizures (excluding seizures <36 hours or SE <96 hours pre randomisation): 10% vs 8%\nGCS (median): 3 vs 3\nFinal neurologic diagnosis\n\nHypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy: 29% vs 32%\nBrain trauma: 9% vs 17%\nIntracranial haemorrhage: 22% vs 25%\nIschaemic stroke: 10% vs 5%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nContinuous EEG (cEEG) for 30-48 hours\n\nInterruptions less than 2 hours were allowed e.g. for neuroimaging\n\n\n\nControl\n\nRoutine EEG (rEEG)\n\nTwo 20-30 minute recordings over 48 hours\nNo repetition on the same day\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nEEG to commence within 4 hours of referral\nResults communicated to treating teams regularly\n\nWithin 2 hours of EEG start, and 2-3 times daily\n\n\nProtocolled intervention ceased in patients diagnosed as having seizures or SE during the intervention period\n\nSubsequent treatment according to best practice (to allow conversion to cEEG if needed)\n\n\nManagement of seizures not protocolised (pragmatic trial)\n\nOutcome\n\n\u00a0Primary outcome: No significant difference in mortality at 6 months between cEEG vs rEEG\n\nMortality at 6 months : rEEG 88/182 (48.4%) vs cEEG 89/182 (48.9%) RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.25, P= 0.92)\nAdjusted for Charlston Comorbidity Index (CCI), cardiac arrest: RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.26, P=0.85)\nNo difference after exploratory stratification for hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, or age, baseline modified

encephalopathy, calculated to explore whether cEEG facilitated withdrawal of life sustaining treatment\n\ncEEG median 6 days (range 0-157), vs rEEG median 8.5 days (range 0-156), p=0.07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nDespite increased detection of seizures, and higher rate of anti-seizure treatment modifications, cEEG does not seem to correlate with improved patient outcome compared with repeated rEEG\nrEEG may represent a valid alternative to cEEG in centres with limited resources\n\nStrengths\n\nFirst RCT to investigate this topic\nNear complete follow up: only 4 patients lost to follow up\nBlinding of outcome assessors\nIntention to monitor analysis\nPragmatic design\n\nRecruitment and reporting in hours, consistent with resource availability at most centres\n\n\n15% detection of seizure in cEEG\n\nComparable to existing literature\n\n\nHeterogenous aetiology\n\nIncreases generalisability of the results\n\n\nPatient centred outcomes\n\nMortality\nFunctional outcome measures\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nHeterogenous aetiology\n\nEffect in subgroups may be diluted\nNon significant 5% improvement in mortality in patients without hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy should be investigated in future studies\n\n\nHigher mortality rate compared to previous studies\n\nMay be due to high proportion (30%) with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, known to have a high mortality rate\n\n\nBedside clinicians were not blinded to patient allocation\nPotential selection bias as only referred patients were recruited; not all patients with altered level of consciousness were screened\nReporting limitations overnight which may have resulted in prolonged seizure time without intervention\n\nThis may dilute the benefit of cEEG\n\n\nNot stratified for severity of altered level of consciousness\nInterventions in response to seizure detection not protocolised\n\nIncluding conversion to cEEG\nBut most patients received anti epileptic drugs as per the author (not published)\n\n\nIntention to monitor analysis means crossover to cEEG not accounted for in analysis\nEvolution of mRS is based on estimated preadmission mRS, therefore interpret with caution\n27 patients who were randomised later withdrew consent and their results were not included in analysis\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn critically ill patients with altered level of consciousness cEEG compared with rEEG leads to greater detection and treatment of seizures but has no effect on mortality or functional outcome\nFurther studies may elucidate a benefit for the use of cEEG in particular patient groups e.g. those without hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy\nI will continue to use rEEG to in patients with altered level of consciousness and repeat rEEG if ongoing seizures are suspected. This study suggests that the significant cost (expertise, resources, time) associated with cEEG does not translate to improved outcomes\n\nExternal Links\n\nCERTA trial\nFOUR SCORE\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Tessa Garside @tessagarside\nSummary date: 17th March 2021\nPeer-review editor: Celia Bradford @celiabradford\nImage by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
