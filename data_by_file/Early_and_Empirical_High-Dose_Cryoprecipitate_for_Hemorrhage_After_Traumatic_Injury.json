It remains the leading cause of death in young people\nDeaths often occur early \u2013 > 50% of patients who die, do so in the first 4 hours\nThe most common mechanism of death is haemorrhage, which is exacerbated by coagulopathy and fibrinolysis\nFibrinogen acts to stabilise clot formation. Trauma causes activation of coagulation pathways and fibrinogen levels drop rapidly due to consumption, fibrinolysis and dilution\nThere is an association between low fibrinogen levels and poor outcomes, and it is hypothesised that cryoprecipitate transfusion may ameliorate this state\nThe ideal approach to transfusion in traumatic haemorrhage has been extensively studied and refined over the years\nThe PAMPer trial demonstrated that for trauma patients at risk for hemorrhagic shock, the administration of thawed plasma during prehospital air medical transport was safe and resulted in lower 30-day mortality\nThe\u00a0CRYOSTAT pilot trial conducted at two UK trauma centres showed that administration of cryoprecipitate (10 units) in addition to the empiric massive haemorrhage pack (6u PRBC, 4u FFP +/- TXA) raised fibrinogen levels, and was feasible, with a mean time to administration of 60 minutes\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, phase 3, interventional RCT\nOpen-label, parallel-groups\nAllocation concealment achieved using opaque sealed envelopes\nThe randomisation sequence was computer generated with variable block sizes and stratified by centre\nA waiver of consent was allowed in order to randomise patients\n\nInformed consent to continue data collection was obtained from the patient or legally authorised representative as soon as was practically possible\n\n\nThe trial was designed to detect a 7% absolute mortality difference with 90% power and a 5% level of significance\nA sample size of 1600 patients was calculated adjusted after 4% drop out\nAnalysis was by intention to treat\nThe trial was overseen by an ethics committee and a data monitoring committee to review interim data and monitor patient safety\n\nSetting\n\n26 major trauma centres in the UK and USA.\nPatients were enrolled from August 2017 to November 2021\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nTrauma with evidence of active haemorrhage requiring activation of the local Major Haemorrhage Protocol (MHP)\n\nMHP activation at all centres included SBP < 90 mmHg at any point\n\n\nStarted or received at least 1 unit of any blood component\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nTransferred from another hospital\nInjuries deemed incompatible with life by trauma team leader\n>3 hours elapsed since the time of injury\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants:\n\n1604 eligible patients, 799 were randomized to the cryoprecipitate group and 805 to the standard care group\n\n1531 patients in intention-to-treat analysis due to missing data for 73 patients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaseline characteristics were well matched:\n\nComparing cryoprecipitate group vs standard care:\nMedian Injury Severity Score: 29 vs 29\nMen: 79 vs 80%\nMedian Age: 38 vs 40\n\n10% > 70 years old\n\n\nMedian time from injury to ED arrival: 75 vs 77 minutes\nBlunt injury: 63 vs 65%\nPenetrating injury: 37 vs 35%\nHead injury (AIS >4): 24% vs 29%\nPrehospital Tranexamic Acid: 79 vs 80%\nPrehospital Blood Products: 43% across both groups\nMedian time to randomisation: 15 minutes across both groups\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n3 pools of cryoprecipitate (6g fibrinogen) given as early as possible (ideally within 90 minutes) after hospital admission AND MHP as per control group\n\n85% of patients got cryoprecipitate in the intervention group\nThe main reasons for not receiving it were no evidence of active bleeding, haemostasis was achieved or the patient died\nMedian time to cryoprecipitate was 68 minutes (68% received the first dose within 90 minutes)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nAs per local MHP \u2013 typically patients were transfused RBC:FFP:Platelets in a ratio of 1:1:1 with 2 pools cryoprecipitate with second and subsequent pack (4g fibrinogen)\n\n32% of patients received cryoprecipitate in the control group\nMedian time to cryoprecipitate was 120 minutes (9% received the first dose within 90 minutes)\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll other therapies were as per local major trauma protocols\n\nOutcome\n\nComparing Cryoprecipitate vs Standard Care\nPrimary outcome:\n\nNo difference in all-cause mortality at 28 days\n25.3% (192 of 760) vs 26.1% (201 of 771)\n\nOR 0.96 [95% CI 0.75-1.23] p=0.74\nThe per-protocol analysis also showed no difference\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nNo difference between groups in:\n\n6-hour mortality: 7.1% vs 8.6% (OR 0.82 [0.58-1.17] p=0.26)\n24-hour mortality: 11.2% vs 12.2% (OR 0.91 [0.63-1.31] p=0.61)\n6- or 12-month mortality\nTransfusion Requirements, Ventilator Days, ICU LOS, Hospital LOS, GOS score at day 28\n\n\nMedian time to death was 191 minutes in the cryoprecipitate group and 86 minutes in the control group\nAn analysis of the impact of time to cryoprecipitate administration on 28-day mortality (eFigure2):\n\n< 45 minutes: OR 1.45 [0.91 \u2013 2.31]\n46-60 minutes: OR 1.16 [95% CI, 0.78-1.73]\n61-90 minutes: OR 0.57 [95% CI, 0.38-0.87]\n> 90 minutes: OR 1.00 [95% CI, 0.62-1.60]\n\n\nPre-defined subgroups:\n\nNo difference in results based on sex, age, head injury\nThe penetrating injury group fared worse with cryoprecipitate\n\n28-day mortality 10% vs 16.2% OR 1.74 [1.2-2.51]\n\n\nThe blunt injury group had 28-day mortality of 30.4% (Cryo) vs 34.8% (Standard Care) OR 0.82 [0.62-1.09]\n\n\nSafety:\n\nNo significant difference in\n\nThrombotic events (PE, DVT)\nMyocardial infarction, Stroke\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nEarly empiric high dose cryoprecipitate in patients with haemorrhage following trauma did not reduce 28-day mortality\n\nStrengths\n\nStrong internal validity:\n\nAllocation concealment\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nWell balanced baseline characteristics\nMinimal loss for primary analysis\n\n4.6% (39 patients in cryoprecipitate group and 34 patients in control group)\n\n\n\n\nAn important clinical question with outcomes that are clinically meaningful\nPatients had high injury severity scores thus increasing the chance of finding a treatment effect\nThe results are likely applicable to other similar advanced trauma care systems\n\nHowever, this was primarily a trial in UK hospitals, with only 49 US patients randomised so the external applicability outside the UK would need to be assumed cautiously\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnblinded \u2013 a potential source of bias\nThere was some crossover between groups\n\n15% of cryoprecipitate group did not receive any\n9% of the control group got early cryoprecipitate (within 90 minutes)\nThis was not deemed to impact the results in the per-protocol analysis\n\n\nThe intervention was empiric and not tailored to the individual\u2019s needs such that some patients may not have had hypofibrinogenemia\n\nGiving cryoprecipitate in these patients with normal fibrinogen may be pro-inflammatory and harmful\n\n\nThere is a signal to benefit in the blunt trauma subgroup and harm in the penetrating subgroup. However, there is inadequate statistical power to interpret these subgroup findings\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe results from this trial do not support empiric cryoprecipitate therapy in trauma patients with major haemorrhage\nThe hypothesis that there is a Goldilocks zone (i.e. 61-90 minutes) in which administration of cryoprecipitate may be beneficial is thought-provoking and warrants further exploration\nI will use ROTEM to guide product administration in my bleeding trauma patients\n\nExternal Links\n\nArticle CRYOSTAT-2\nFurther reading PATCH trial\nFurther reading Centre for Trauma Sciences\nFurther reading\u00a0St Emlyn\u2019s review\nCritical Care Reviews Presentation\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford @celiabradford\nSummary date: October 14 2023\nPeer-review editor: George Walker\nPicture by: Clker-Free-Vector-Images / Pixabay\n\n\n"
