Chest 2008;134;117-125\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with acute respiratory failure can bedside ultrasound, compared to standard diagnostic methods, provide an accurate diagnosis?\n\nDesign\n\nObservational diagnostic cohort study (Derivation only)\nBlinding of treating staff to test of interest\nUltrasound operator not blinded to patients clinical presentation\nConsecutive patients\n\nSetting\n\nTwo intensive care units in France\nPerformed over 4 years \u2013 dates not stated\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria: Adult patients with acute respiratory failure\n\nDefined by \u2018classical clinical and biological criteria for requiring admission to the ICU\u2019\n\n\nExclusion critera: Patients excluded post-hoc if:\n\nNever received a definite diagnosis (n=16)\nSeveral official diagnosis (n=16)\nRare diagnosis (n=9)\n\n\n301 patients had ultrasound performed of whom 260 included in analysis\n\nTest of Interest\n\nLung ultrasound\n\nperformed within 20 minutes of admission to ICU\nlasted <3 minutes\n5-MHz microconvex probe\nSemi-recumbent position, or were supine if intubated (n = 35)\nAnterior approach assessing\n\nArtefact analysis\n\nA lines: horizontal repetitive artifacts originating from the pleural line\nB lines: vertical, comet-tail artifacts originating from the pleural line, long, hyperechoic, well-defined, dynamic, erasing A lines. Three or more B lines in a single view are called B+ lines\n\n\nLung sliding\nAlveolar consolidation\n\n\nLateral subposterior approach assessing:\n\nConsolidation or effusion\n\n\nDVT\n\ndiagnosed by visualisation of intraluminal thrombosis or absence of compressibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nOn completion of study, the authors analysed combinations of ultrasound signs that gave a sensitivity and specificity of >90% for the diagnosis, as assessed by the gold standard investigation. The following profiles were assigned:\n\nA profile\n\nAnterior predominant bilateral A lines associated with lung sliding (with possible focalized B lines)\n\n\nA\u2019 profile\n\nA profile with abolished lung sliding and without lung point\n\n\nB profile\n\nAnterior predominant bilateral B+ lines associated with lung sliding (with possible focalized A lines)\n\n\nB\u2019 profile\n\nB profile with abolished lung sliding\n\n\nA/B profile\n\nAnterior predominant B+ lines on one side, predominant A lines on the other\n\n\nC profile\u00a0\n\nAnterior alveolar consolidation(s)\n\n\nPLAPS profile\n\nPosterior and/or lateral alveolar consolidation and/or pleural effusion\n\n\nNormal profile\n\nA profile without PLAPS (regardless of posterior A or B lines)\n\n\n\nGold Standard Investigation\n\nOfficial diagnosis by the ICU team blinded to the test of interest\n\nHistory, examination, radiography read by radiologists, CT (n=38), ECHO (n=not reported), blood tests, response to treatment\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: no\u00a0primary outcome defined\n\n\n\nAlgorithm developed for performing and interpreting lung ultrasound (The BLUE protocol). The BLUE protocol, retrospectively, gave an accurate diagnosis for 90.5% of patients\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn 90.5% of cases of respiratory failure, an immediate accurate diagnosis was made with respiratory ultrasound.\n\nStrengths\n\nBlinding of clinicians determining the gold standard investigation to the test of interest\nUse of consecutive patients. However, as there were only two clinicians performing the ultrasound, the patients were likely to be consecutive as long as one of these two staff were present, rather than including all consecutive patients who were admitted to the intensive care.\nStandardised protocol for performing ultrasound scan\n\nWeaknesses\n\nExcluded patients post hoc with multiple diagnoses etc. This is a major weakness as when we perform a scan we do not know if our patient will have a rare diagnosis or multiple pathology. This means that the sensitivity and specificity are likely to be lower than reported\nThe two staff performing the ultrasound have extensive experience. This may limit the external validity of the study.\nThe level of agreement between the two clinicians performing the ultrasounds was not reported (the kappa score)\nNo validation group\nConfidence intervals for results not reported in trial. (We have calculated them)\nSensitivity for C profile for diagnosing pneumonia was reported as 11% in text and 21% in table. We have calculated it at 22%.\nNot registered on https://clinicaltrials.gov/\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with acute respiratory failure bedside, ultrasound appears to help determine the diagnosis. Validation studies are required to confirm the utility of the BLUE protocol. Due to biases in the study design the performance of the BLUE protocol is likely to be less accurate than the results reported in this trial.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[abstract] Relevance of lung ultrasound in the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure: the BLUE protocol\n[further reading] Tutorial: Lung ultrasound (includes the BLUE protocol)\n[further reading] BJA: Practical approach to lung ultrasound\n[further reading] CEURF \u2013 ultrasonography for the critically ill\n[further listening] Ultrasound podcast: lungs\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0David Slessor\nSummary date:\u00a024th Feb 2016\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0Adrian Wong\n\n\n"
