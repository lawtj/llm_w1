BJA 2016; 116(5):670-9. doi: 10.1093/bja/aew058\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients having elective surgery and with a simulated difficult airway (using a cervical collar), does the choice of videolaryngoscope affect the first attempt intubation success rate?\n\nDesign\n\nMulticentre randomised controlled trial\nComputer generated randomisation using sealed opaque envelopes\nBlock randomisation of 10 and separated for each anaesthetist\n6 different videolaryngoscopes were evaluated\nIntention to treat analysis\nSample size calculation: 107 patients per device were required to\u00a0give an \u03b1 level of 0.05 and a power 80%. This was\u00a0based on\u00a0an intubation success rate of 0.9 as the clinically acceptable lower limit for a device that is designed for management of difficult airways\n\nSetting\n\n3 university hospitals in Switzerland\nDecember 2012 \u2013 January 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\u00a0Patients undergoing elective surgery requiring tracheal intubation;\u00a0ASA I-III\nExclusion: risk of aspiration and known or predicted difficult airway (BMI >35 kg m\u22122, Mallampati >III, thyromental distance <6 cm, interincisor distance <3.5 cm, known difficult mask ventilation/ laryngoscopy, and planned or previous history of awake tracheal intubation)\n720 patients (120 in each group)\nBaseline characterstics: sex; age; BMI; mallampati score; thymomental distance; mouth opening with and without collar were similar in all groups\n\nIntervention\n\n6 different videolaryngoscopes were evaluated\n\nthree unchannelled\n\nReusable C-MACTM\u00a0D-blade and stylet\nGlideScopeTM\u00a0blade 3 with glidescope stylet\nMcGrathTM\u00a0with MAC blade 3 and stylet\n\n\nthree channelled\n\nAirtraqTM size 2 in women and 3 in men\nA.P.

This was adjusted to permit a minimal mouth opening of 18mm. The head was\u00a0was taped to the trolley to inhibit neck movement\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccessful intubation was defined as placement of the tube in the trachea within 180 s, confirmed by end-tidal carbon dioxide\n\n\n\n\nTwo intubation attempts with the randomised videolaryngoscope were allowed. The study was terminated once tracheal intubation was achieved, after two unsuccessful attempts, or when airway injury, bronchospasm, technical failure of the videolaryngoscope, or a reduction of oxygen saturation below 90% occurred\nControl\n\nEach videolaryngoscope was compared with the other five\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: first-attempt intubation success rate\n\n> 90% for C-MAC\u00a0and\u00a0McGrath\u00a0\n95% CI > 0.9 only for\u00a0McGrath\u00a0\n\nMcGrath: 117 patients (98%) CI 92-99\nC-MAC: 114 patients (95%) CI 89-98\nKingVision: 104 patients (87%) CI 79-92\nGlideScope: 102 patients (85%) CI 77-90\nAirtraq: 102 patients (85%) CI 77-90\nA.P.

In this setting, first-attempt success rates were 85\u201398%, except for the A.P. Advance difficult airway blade. Highest success and lowest tissue trauma rates were achieved by the McGrath and C-MAC D-blade, highlighting the importance of the videolaryngoscope blade design\n\nStrengths\n\nStudy was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier NCT01692535)\nTo ensure that each anaesthetist intubated 10 times with each videolaryngoscope, block randomisation was separated for each anaesthetist participating in this study\nInduction and neuromuscular blocking agent (rocuronium 0.6mg/kg) choice was standardised\nAdequate neuromuscular block in readiness for tracheal intubation was controlled by loss if 1Hz muscle twitching (TOF WatchTM\u00a0)\nAll participating consultant anaesthetists were considered airway management experts and trained with all videolaryngoscopes on both manikins and patients until they, as airway specialists, felt competent with each device\nThis is a well constructed trial bound by the limitations of airway equipment research: blinding and subjectivity are hard to improve\n\nWeaknesses\n\nA standard Macintosh laryngoscope would have been a useful control . The authors provide reasons for this\n\nWe did not include a standard Macintosh laryngoscope with direct laryngoscopy because it is known that in patients with difficult airways videolaryngoscopes are superior regarding intubation success rates, glottic view, and rates of difficult intubation\n\nThe\u00a0C-MAC videolaryngoscope macintosh blade would have been a useful comparator\nThe performance ability for each anaesthetists with the range of videolaryngoscopes was based on self-assessment for competency\nExclusion of patients with predicted difficult airways (including anyone obese) may limit external validity / generalisability\nApplying a collar for simulation is not the same as all difficult airways that may present to anaesthetists\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe trial primary hypothesis, first attempt intubation success rate > 90%, was accepted only for the McGrath. The A.P Advance performed well below the other comparators. Whilst the internal validity of the trial is limited by subjectivity and the operator being unblinded, it provides a useful overview of variation in performance and handling of the scopes\n\nExternal Links\n\n[abstract] Evaluation of six videolaryngoscopes in 720 patients with a simulated difficult airway: a multicentre randomized controlled trial\u00a0\n[series of video resources] SMACC-Dub Laryngoscopy\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Steve Mathieu\nSummary date: 30th May 2016\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
