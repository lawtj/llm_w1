NEJM 2023; Online ahead of print. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2307227\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock undergoing revascularisation, does the early unselected application of extracorporeal life support reduce mortality from any cause at day 30?\n\nBackground\n\nThe use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO), which is an advanced technology that can provide temporary replacement of cardiac and respiratory function in critically ill patients, has increased substantially over the last decade\nObservational studies suggest VA ECMO reduces mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock\nHowever VA ECMO is associated with a high risk of complications\nIt also increases afterload on the left ventricle due to retrograde flow in the aorta, which may be unfavourable conditions for cardiac recovery\nA recently published RCT failed to demonstrate benefit with the early application of ECMO in patients with cardiogenic shock\n\nDesign\n\nInvestigator-initiated, multi-centre, parallel group, unblinded randomised controlled trial\nPatients randomised in 1:1 ratio using web-based system with stratification by trial site\nIntention to treat analysis\nTrial powered to detect a 14% reduction (49%->35%) in all cause mortality\n\nSetting\n\n44 institutions in 2 countries (Germany and Slovenia)\nJune 2019 and November 2022\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion (all of):\n\nAdults > 18 years of age\nAcute myocardial infarction with planned revascularisation (PCI or CABG)\nSystolic blood pressure < 90mmHg for > 30 mins or requiring catecholamine infusion to maintain SBP > 90mmHg\nSigns of impaired organ perfusion\nArterial lactate > 3mmol/L\n\n\nExclusion:\n\n> 45 mins of CPR prior to enrolment\nMechanical cause of cardiogenic shock or non cardiac cause of shock\nOnset of shock > 12 hours\nSevere peripheral vascular disease prevent ECMO insertion\nAge > 80\nLife limiting illness (survival < 6 months).\n\n\n877 screened\n420 patients enrolled\n3 withdrew consent\n417 included in intention to treat analysis\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nGenerally well-balanced\nAge: 62 vs 63\nMale: 81% vs 81%\nCardiovascular risk factors: similar\nPrevious PCI: 13 vs 21%\nPrevious Stroke: 10% vs 5%\nSystolic Blood pressure: 95 vs 97mmHg\nResuscitation before randomisation: 78 vs 78%\nTime to ROSC in resuscitated patients: 20 vs 20 mins\nLactate: 7 vs 7\nTroponin: 1540 vs 987\nSCAI Shock stage\n\nC: 49 vs 53%\nD: 18 vs 8%\nE: 32 vs 38%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nImmediate commencement of VA ECMO in angiography suite\n\nECMO ideally commenced before PCI\nMaximal flows targeted\nDistal perfusion catheter insertion encouraged\nPre-defined criteria for left ventricular unloading and weaning\n17 patients did not receive ECLS for technical or clinical reasons\n\n\n\nControl\n\nMedical management inline with current guidelines\n\nPre-defined criteria for escalation to additional mechanical support (Intra-aortic balloon pump or microaxial left ventricular assist device\nCross over to VA ECMO for refractory cardiac arrest allowed but strongly discouraged. 28 patients crossed over\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nCulprit only revascularisation strategy\nCABG if unsuitable for PCI\nAnti-thrombotic therapy recommended ADP inhibitor\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: 30 day all cause-mortality no difference between groups 48 vs 49%, relative risk, 0.98 (0.80 to 1.19) P=0.81\n\nEarly separation of Kaplan-meier curve over first 5 days but this disappears by day 15\nNo difference in any pre-defined subgroups\nSimilar causes of death between groups:\n\nMajority of patients died of refractory cardiogenic shock roughly 50% in each group\nApprox 25% of patients died from brain injury in each group\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nComparing intervention vs. control group\n\nNo significant difference in\n\nPoor neurological outcome\nRenal replacement therapy\nRepeat revascularisation\nTime to stabilisation\nDuration of ICU or Hospitalisation\n\n\nComplications significantly greater in intervention group\n\nLimb ischaemia requiring intervention 11 vs 4%\nModerate or severe bleeding 23 vs 10%\n\nN.B Many bleeding complications occurred at ECMO decannulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock, the incidence of death from any cause at 30 days was not lower with early unselective use of VA ECMO\n\nStrengths\n\nWell designed, investigator-initiated trial in a complex and challenging population to do clinical trials in\nClinically relevant question\nRapid recruitment of patients reducing the risk of bias due to temporal trends\nRelatively large numbers of patients (compared to other trials in the area) with a clinically justifiable relative risk reduction in the power calculation\nWeb based randomisation, allocation concealment and follow up\nGroups well-balanced at baseline\nAppear to have recruited the target population of sick patients with cardiogenic shock\nAttempt to standardise ECMO treatment and to prevent crossover for treatment\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe liberal inclusion criteria, allowing early unselected implantation before PCI and also enrolment of elderly patients, limit the generalisability of these findings\n\nA quarter of patients were older than 69 (intervention) and 71 (control) years old which may not reflect practice elsewhere\n\n\nVery high rates of pre-ECMO cardiac arrest (77% in both groups) limits the findings to this population only, and may have reduced the capacity for VA ECMO to alter outcomes\nNo documented standardised process for neuroprognostication\n12% crossover to ECMO in control group suggest ongoing lack of equipoise from clinicians, and also reduces the separation between the two groups biasing the trial towards to finding no difference\nThere was a relatively low rate of LV unloading and high initial ECMO flows which may limit cardiac recovery\nCannulation performed exclusively by cardiologists in the cath lab, and therefore the population enrolled and intervention delivered may differ to that of intensive care, emergency physician or surgeon led programs\nLack of blinding may have influenced clinician practice\nLarge number of sites that recruited low numbers\n\nHowever post hoc analysis did not find any difference between 5 or more or 4 or less recruited per centre\n\n\nNo documentation of rates of transition to durable mechanical support or heart transplant, which may be relevant given high proportion dying from cardiogenic shock\nShort term (day 30) and minimal functional outcomes reported\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis well conducted randomised controlled trial suggests that early unselected VA ECMO in acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock will not reduce mortality and may increase complications\nI would not advocate for the early commencement of VA ECMO in patients who can be stabilised with medical therapy. I would still consider the use of VA ECMO patients who are refractory to medical therapy and have an opportunity for myocardial recovery or destination therapy such as ventricular assist device or heart transplant\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle: Extracorporeal Life Support in Infarct-Related Cardiogenic Shock\nfurther reading: Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with infarct-related cardiogenic shock: an individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised trials\nfurther reading: ECMO CS \u2013 TBL Summary\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Alastair Brown \u2013 @alastairbrown21\nSummary date: 13th September 2023\nPeer-review editor: Aidan Burrell\nPicture by: author/site: BART ECMO Team\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
