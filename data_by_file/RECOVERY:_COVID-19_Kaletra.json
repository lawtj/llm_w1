To date, the treatments that have shown effectiveness are Dexamethasone, which reduces 28-day mortality and Remdesivir, which may reduce hospital length of stay.\nThe RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVid-19 thERapY) trial describes an overarching trial design that looks at different treatment options simultaneously in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, in an adaptive design. The treatments being studied are:\n\nNo additional treatment (usual care)\nLopinavir 400mg-Ritonavir 100mg by mouth (or nasogastric tube) every 12 hours for 10 days\nAzithromycin 500mg by mouth (or nasogastric tube) or intravenously once daily for 10 days\nTocilizumab (an anti-inflammatory treatment given by injection)\nConvalescent plasma (collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 and contains antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus)\nREGN-COV2 (a combination of monoclonal antibodies directed against coronavirus).\nHydroxychloroquine (this arm of the trial has ceased recruitment, as no benefit demonstrated)\nDexamethasone, oral (liquid or tablets) or intravenous preparation 6 mg once daily for 10 days. Trial completed in adults but recruiting children\n\n\nThis review looks at the Lopinavir-ritonavir (Kaletra) arm of the RECOVERY trial\nLopinavir, a protease inhibitor, has been demonstrated in-vitro to reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication and release from host cells. It is combined with ritonavir to increase its plasma half-life. There is one previous trial published in hospitalised COVID-19 patients, where 99 patients were randomised to Kaletra and 100 patients to usual care: The LOTUS trial. There was no difference in viral clearance, time to clinical improvement or 28-day mortality between groups\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised open-label platform trial\nRandomisation occurred in a ratio of 2:1 [usual care:Lopinavir-ritonavir]\nAllocation concealment\nNo blinding of participants or caring staff\nBlinding of outcome assessors, investigators and the trial steering committee.\nA single online follow-up form was completed when participants were discharged alive from hospital, died or at Day 28 after randomisation\nIntention to treat analysis\nPre-specified subgroups (six in total: age, sex, ethnicity, level of respiratory support, days since symptom onset and predicted 28-day mortality risk)\nSample size calculation is difficult in the situation of a pandemic. The plan was to enrol several thousand patients. An independent data monitoring committee reviewed unblinded data at intervals of around 2 weeks and were responsible for stopping the trial once the results were convincing one way or the other\n\nSetting\n\n176 hospitals in the UK\nPatients were randomised between March 19 2020 and June 29 2020.\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: patients admitted to hospital with suspected or proven SARS-CoV-2 infection\nExclusion:\n\nHepatic insufficiency\nCurrently medicated with a drug that depends on cytochrome P450 3A4 for metabolism\nLopinivir-ritonavir was unavailable at the institution\nThe attending clinician felt Lopinavir-ritonavir was absolutely indicated or contraindicated\n\n\nThe baseline characteristics were well matched between groups\n\nThe mean age was 66 years, the median number of days since symptom onset was 8; 26% were not receiving oxygen,\u00a0 70% were receiving oxygen and only 4% were invasively ventilated\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nLopinavir + Ritonavir\n\nPatients randomised to the active group received lopinavir 400mg + ritonavir 100mg per oral every 12 hours for 10 days AND usual standard care\n1616 received the intervention\n\n\n\nControl\n\nUsual standard care\n\n3424 were allocated usual care\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAzithromycin was given to 23% in the intervention arm and 25% in the usual care arm\nDexamethasone was given to 10% in each arm\nTocilizumab was given to 3% in the intervention arm and 4% in the usual care arm\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: 28-day mortality: no significant difference\n\n23% in the lopinavir-ritonivir group and 22% in the usual care group\n\nRR 1.03 (95% C.I. 0.91-1.17), p=0.60\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:No significant difference in any secondary outcome\n\nComparing lopinavir-ritonivir groups\n\nTime to hospital discharge: median 11 days vs. 11 days\nDischarged from hospital within 28 days: 69% vs. 70%\nProgressed to receipt of mechanical ventilation: 10% vs. 9%\nDeath: 22% vs. 22%\n\n\nNo difference in cardiac arrhythmias or other adverse effects\nNo difference in the pre-specified subgroups\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nLopinavir-ritonivir therapy is not an effective treatment for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19\n\nStrengths\n\nLarge sample size, allocation concealment, intention-to-treat analysis, near complete follow-up\nThe outcome assessors were blinded to the allocation\nThe outcome was clinically meaningful and objective\nThe funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis or data interpretation\nThe results are consistent with other trials of lopinavir-ritonivir in COVID-19 patients (SOLIDARITY trial and LOTUS trial)\nThere did not seem to be other major adverse events observed, eg cardiac arrhythmias or liver function perturbance.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nI\u2019m unsure of the applicability of these results to ICU patients as only 4% of the patients included were invasively mechanically ventilated. The ongoing REMAP-CAP trial has lopinavir-ritonivir as one of the domains which will hopefully answer the question in critically ill patients\nHowever, this treatment is difficult to test in the ICU population if the patient is not swallowing tablets. The crushed tablet tends to block NGTs and the liquid formulation contains an alcohol which disrupts the material integrity of the NGT\nThe treating clinicians were not blinded to the allocation which could introduce bias\nIt is possible that this therapy needs to be given very early in the course of the disease as the mechanism of action is prevention of viral replication. However, even in those patients who were given the drug <7 days following symptom onset there was no signal of benefit\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nLopinavir-ritonivir does not improve outcomes in a hospital population with COVID-19 patients\nFurther trials in critically ill COVID-19 patients may be warranted although there really is no signal of benefit and the drug is difficult to administer in patients unable to swallow, so I would be circumspect about this\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] RECOVERY: Lopinavir-ritonivir\n[further reading] The RECOVERY trial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @celiabradford\nSummary date: Oct 20 2020\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\n\n\n"
