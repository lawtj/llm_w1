Sample size inflated to 4002 patients due to uncertainties underpinning sample size calculation\nThe trial was funded to run for 12 months and at this 12 month point the case numbers of COVID-19 cases diminished considerably so recruitment ceased\nWeb-based allocation concealment\nRandomisation stratified by site, sex and age\nThe patients were not in ICU, but on respiratory support units\nIn centres where all three modalities were available (CPAP, HFNO, COT) allocation was 1:1:1\nIn centres where only 2 modalities were available, allocation was 1:1 (CPAP or HFNO vs COT)\nCrossover was defined as changing to a different modality for >6 hours\nEscalation to intubation was at the discretion of the treating teams\nIntention to treat analysis\n\nSetting\n\n75 hospitals across the UK\nRecruitment from April 2020 \u2013 May 2021\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nPatients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19\n>18 years\nFiO2>40% and SaO2<94%\nPatient suitable for intubation (no limitations in therapy)\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nThose needing intubation/ventilation <1 hour after admission\nPregnant patients\nThose with a contraindication to CPAP or HFNO\n\n\n1277 patients randomised (although 5 were randomised twice, leaving 1272).

In a non-blinded study this may lead to differences between how the groups were treated. Would clinicians be any more or less likely to intubate a patient with a SpO2 of 90% who was on 15l non-rebreathe mask, compared with CPAP with a FiO2 of 0.85?\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTo me this study would change my practice. In my ICU in Australia, patients who were suitable for intubation, needing high FiO2 (>40%) would be moved into the HDU part of ICU\nI would preference using CPAP (or Bipap) on these patients over HFNO in an effort to reduce the progression to intubation. If the patient is unable to tolerate the device, I would try a variety of mask types to see if there is a preference, eg helmet mask vs face mask vs moon mask\nCPAP, compared with HFNO or COT, reduced the need for intubation or death at 30 days in hypoxic patients with COVID-19. This was predominantly due to the reduction in need for intubation\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0An adaptive randomized controlled trial of non-invasive respiratory strategies in acute respiratory failure patients with COVID-19\n[further listening] Critical Care Reviews podcast\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford\nSummary date: 16th August 2021\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\nImage by Daniel B\u00fcscher from Pixabay\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
