JAMA 2021;326(13):1268-1276. doi:10.1001/jama.2021.14785\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients near end of life, does subcutaneous scopolamine butylbromide compared with placebo, reduce the incidence of death rattle?\n\nBackground\n\nThe paper defines death rattle as noisy breathing caused by the presence of mucus in the respiratory tract\nDeath rattle occurs in a number of patients that are dying. This may be something that is distressing for relatives. It is not thought to be distressing to the patients due to their reduced conscious level. However, the actual effect is unknown, and patients may fear it if they have previously heard a death rattle\nAnticholinergics decrease the production of mucus and can be considered for the treatment of death rattle. However there is no evidence to support their use, with 2 RCTs reporting no significant benefit (1, 2)\nThis trial aimed to see if using them prophylactically could prevent the death rattle\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre\nRandomised\nDouble-blind, placebo-controlled trial\nVariable block sizes of 2-4\nInformed consent gained in anticipation of entering the dying phase when patient mentally aware\nRegistered on Netherlands Trial Register\nSample size\n\n180 patients required to give 80% power to detect a relative reduction of 50% from a baseline of 39%, with a false positive rate of 5%\nAssuming that 10% of patients who gave informed consent may not be able to be randomised, the study aimed to gain consent from 200 patients\n\n\nModified intention to treat analysis (excluded patients who were determined not to be in the dying phases after randomisation or if consent withdrawn)\nDeath rattle graded according to Back grade\n\n0: no rattle\n1: audible close to the patient\n2: audible standing at the end of the bed\n3: audible standing in the door opening\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n6 hospices in the Netherlands\nData collected: April 2017 \u2013 December 2019\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdmission to hospice for end-of-life care\nLife expectancy of \u22653 days\nNo signs of disturbed consciousness at the time of informed consent\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nSigns of active respiratory tract infection (upper or lower)\nTracheostomy or tracheal cannula in situ\nUse of anticholinergic drug or octreotide\n\n\n\n\nAt the recognition of the dying phase, the patients were re-assessed for their eligibility based on the following criteria:\n\nNo active respiratory infection\nNot using systemic anticholinergic drugs\nDid not have any death rattle\n\n\n\n\nPatients who completed 8 days of treatment were withdrawn from the study because it was assumed that they had not entered the dying phase\n\n\n1097 patients admitted to hospice, of whom 162 were randomised, and 157 included in primary analysis\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nMale: 46% vs 42%\nAge: 78 vs 75\nPrimary diagnosis\n\nCancer: 84% vs 89%\n\nLung cancer: 18% vs 35%\n\n\nCardiovascular disease: 10% vs 1%\nCOPD: 1% vs 3%\n\n\nCo-morbidity\n\nCOPD: 10% vs 23%\n\n\nSmoked in the previous year: 14% vs 33%\nUrinary catheter in situ at the recognition of dying phase: 63% vs 72%\nSedatives given at the recognition of the dying phase: 19% vs 21%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nScopolamine butylbromide\n\nSubcutaneously 20mg (1ml) four times a day\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\nSaline, 1ml\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nDying phase determined by MDT using clinical judgement based on standardised signs\n\nThese signs included being bedbound, semi-comatose and no longer able to take oral medications or swallow\n\n\nAfter the recognition of the dying phase the \u201cCare Program for the Dying\u201d was used\n\nThe template was expanded to include the Beck Scale and the Vancouver Interaction and Calmness Scale (VICS) for restlessness in addition to the 13 other goals of care that were evaluated every 4 hours\n\n\nTreatment was continued until death, or until occurrence of a death rattle of grade 2 or above at two consecutive time points four hours apart (the primary outcome)\n\nAt this point the study medication was deemed to have failed and usual care, including open use of anticholinergics as needed, was provided\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\n\n\nOccurrence of a \u2265 grade 2 death rattle measured at 2 consecutive time points within a 4-hour interval \u2013 significantly reduced in Scopolamine group\n\n\n13% vs 27% (difference 14%, 95% C.I. 2%-27%, p=0.02)\n\nNNT 8\nFragility index 1 patient\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nComparing intervention vs. control group\n\nNo significant difference in\n\nRestlessness\n\n28% vs 23%\n\n\nDry mouth\n\n10% vs 15%\n\n\nUrinary retention\n\n23% vs 17%\n\n\n\n\nSignificantly reduced in Scopolamine group\n\nCumulative incidence of death rattle at 48 hours\n\n8% vs 17%\n\n\nTime from the recognition of the dying phase to death rattle\n\nHR 0.44 (0.20-0.92), p=0.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-hoc analysis\n\nDuration of dying phase \u2013 significantly longer in Scopolamine group\n\n42.8 vs 29.5 hours (difference -13.3; 95% C.I. -17.4 to -6.4), p=0.04\n\n\nIn the placebo group, the occurrence of death rattle was lower in patients with the following conditions (compared with the rest of the placebo group)\n\nLung cancer: 11%\nCOPD as a comorbidity: 17%\nRecent history of smoking: 15%\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nProphylactic subcutaneous scopolamine significantly reduced the occurrence of the death rattle\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised\nDouble-blinded\nMulti-centre\nRegistered on Netherlands Trial Registry\n\nWeaknesses\n\nFinal analysis included only 10% of the population that were admitted to the hospices\nThe placebo group included a higher % of patients with lung cancer as their primary diagnosis, COPD as a co-morbidity and a history of smoking in the last year. The death rattle was observed less commonly in these groups of patients compared with the rest of the placebo population. With a low fragility index, the differences found in the primary analysis may be due to differences in baseline characteristics\nThe duration of dying was significantly longer in the scopolamine group. This may be because scopolamine increases the duration of dying, which in my opinion would be an unwanted side effect, or it may be because there were differences in baseline characteristics\n\nIf there were differences in baseline characteristics this may lead to bias\n\n\nWith a relatively small sample size there may have been significant differences in side effects that were not picked up\nThis study was conducted in a hospice setting. The staffing ratios and management of patients that are dying may be different in an ICU setting, which may limit the external validty\nThe inter-observer variability for the assessment of the primary outcome was not stated\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients near the end of life, scopolamine compared with placebo significantly reduced the incidence of the death rattle. However, with a very low fragility index and differences in baseline characteristics between the study groups, I would want to see further evidence before this becomes routine practice\nI would also want future trials to be adequately powered to determine any clinically significant differences in side effects, as these may outweigh any benefits from this treatment\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of Prophylactic Subcutaneous Scopolamine Butylbromide on Death Rattle in Patients at the End of Life The SILENCE Randomized Clinical Trial\n[editorial] Preventing Death Rattle With Prophylactic Subcutaneous Scopolamine Butylbromide\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 10/11/2021\nPeer-review editor: George Walker\nPhoto by: Kristina Flour on Unsplash\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
