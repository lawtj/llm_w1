In patients with refractory VF beta-blockade should be considered\n\nStrengths\n\nClear inclusion/exclusion criteria\nStandardised dosing of esmolol\nReported use of therapeutic hypothermia and emergent cardiac catheterisation\nReported patient-orientated outcomes\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRetrospective\nSmall sample size\nNon-randomised, non-blinded. Unclear why some patients treated with esmolol and others were not. Unclear why different rates of therapeutic hypothermia and emergent cardiac catheterisation between the two groups\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe use of esmolol for refractory VF was associated with a dramatic, but non significant, improvement in mortality. This association may be due to a causal effect of esmolol. However, the small sample size or confounding variables such as the use of therapeutic hypothermia and emergent cardiac catheterisation may also account for the differences found. Further studies are required. In the mean time, if I have a patient with refractory VF, with no other treatment options available such as cardiac catheterisation I will use esmolol prior to stopping resuscitation.\nSurvival with good neurological outcome can be achieved with prolonged CPR (56-68 minutes)\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0[Use of esmolol after failure of standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation to treat patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation.]\n[Further Reading]\u00a0LITFL Electrical Storm or Refractory VF/VT\n[Further Reading]\u00a0UMEM Educational Peals\n[Podcast]\u00a0EMCrit Intra-arrest \n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date: 17 Dec 2014\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@DuncanChambler\n\n\n\n"
