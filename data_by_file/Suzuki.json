Critical Care 2015; 19:162: 1-11 doi: 10.1186/s-015-0865-1\nClinical Question\n\nDoes the administration of paracetamol reduce mortality in critically ill patients on the Intensive Care Unit?\n\nDesign\n\nRetrospective observational study\nMulticenter\n\nSetting\n\nData from 4 ICU\u2019s. All large tertiary centres, Australia\nData collection from Jan 2000 to September 2010 (varied across centres)\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: All adult patients admitted to ICUs during the period when electronic data capture of paracetamol and body temperature prescription was possible\nExclusion: Readmission episodes; patients for whom data were not available for temperature, admission diagnosis or vital status at hospital discharge; patients with insufficient data for illness severity assessment\n15,818 patients\n\nIntervention\n\nPatients who received at least 1g of paracetamol (n=10,046)\n\nControl\n\nPatients who did not receive paracetamol (n=5772)\n\nComparing patients who received paracetamol with patients who did not receive paracetamol\n\n\nAPACHE II Score: \u00a016.5 vs. 17.7, p<0.001\nSAPS II: 30.2 vs. 28.3, p<0.001\nMechanical ventilation within first 24 hours of admission: 74% vs. 70%, p<0.001\nAcute renal failure: 5% vs. 8%, p> 0.001\nElective surgery: 55% vs. 37%,\u00a0p<0.001\nInfection as admission diagnosis: 9% vs. 9%, p=0.99\nTemperature >38C: 34% vs. 18%, p<0.001\n\n\nOutcome\n\nComparing patients who received paracetamol with patients who did not receive paracetamol\n\nPrimary outcome: Hospital mortality\n\n9.9% vs. 20.1%, p<0.0001\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nICU mortality\n\n5.3% vs. 14.9%, p<0.0001\n\n\nMultivariate logistic regression analysis: paracetamol administration significantly and independently associated with reduced in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 0.60, 95% C.I. 0.53-0.68, p<0.001)\n\n\nConsistent findings in subgroup analysis:\n\nIn surgical patients (n=9,994), administration of paracetamol was a \u00a0predictor of better outcome\n\nAdjusted OR 0.72 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.91), p=0.006 Adjusted HR 0.51 (95% CI 0.42-0.61), p= < 0.0001\n\n\nIn medical patients (n=5,824), administration of paracetamol was a \u00a0predictor of better outcome\n\nAdjusted OR 0.56 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.66), p<0.001 Adjusted HR 0.51 (95% CI 0.45-0.57), p= < 0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nParacetamol administration in the ICU appears to be independently associated with reduced in-hospital mortality and time to death after adjustment for multiple potential confounders and propensity score. This association, however, was modified by the presence of fever, suspected infection and lesser illness severity and may represent the effect of indication bias\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre\nLarge number of patients studied\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRetrospective\nObservational\nSignificant differences between the groups. This included severity scores; number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation; incidence of acute kidney injury; elective surgical admissions; medical vs surgical presentations\nDid not record if patients were treated with interventions\u00a0 that would affect temperature (e.g therapeutic hypothermia)\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\nIn critically ill patients, paracetamol was associated with a decreased mortality. There are many potential confounding variables that may account for this. A RCT is required to determine any outcome benefit. I eagerly await the results of the HEAT trial\n\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[open access pdf of article] Paracetamol therapy and outcome of critically ill patients: a multicenter retrospective observational study\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @stevemathieu75\nSummary date: 26th June 2015\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\n\n\n"
