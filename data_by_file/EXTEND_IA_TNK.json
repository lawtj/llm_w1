Campbell et al for the EXTEND-IA TNK study investigators; New England Journal of Medicine April 2018; 378:1573-1582; doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1716405\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with anterior circulation strokes undergoing endovascular thrombectomy, is IV thrombolysis within 4.5 hours of stroke onset with tenecteplase non-inferior to alteplase at establishing reperfusion?\n\nBackground\n\nThe management of acute stroke has evolved rapidly in the past few years. See the\u00a0DEFUSE-3 study\nEndovascular thrombectomy has been added to alteplase (a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) for patients presenting with a large-vessel cerebral artery occlusion within the first six hours\nTenecteplase is a genetically-modified variant of alteplase with superior fibrin specificity and a longer half-life that permits bolus administration\nTenecteplase can be infused more rapidly than alteplase and is less expensive\nThis shorter duration of administration may help to minimise the time to thrombectomy\nIn addition, tenecteplase has been shown to have a lower incidence of haemorrhagic side-effects than alteplase following administration for ST-elevation myocardial infarction\nA previous phase II study has shown that tenecteplase may improve cerebral reperfusion on CT at 24 hours and may result in better clinical and functional outcomes (Parsons et al; NEJM 2012)\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n\nCentralised web server\nStratified according to site of involved vessel\n\n\nOpen-label\nBlinded outcome assessment\nNon-inferiority\n\nNon-inferiority boundary of 4.6% based on recent meta-analysis that reported 7.5% of patients who received alteplase had reperfusion at initial angiographic assessment\nNon-inferiority would be established if the lower boundary of the two-sided 95% confidence interval of the % difference in patients with substantial reperfusion was greater than -2.3 percentage points\n\n\nSuperiority\n\nAssessment for the superiority of tenecteplase was planned in the event of non-inferiority being established\nUsing logistic regression analysis, with adjustment for the site of vessel occlusion\n\n\nBlinded adaptive sample size re-estimation performed after 100 patients enrolled, determining a final sample size of 202 patients\nIntention to treat and per-protocol analysis performed\n\nOnly 1 analysis presented as no crossover between groups occurred, and only 2 exclusions from both analyses due to withdrawal of consent (n=1) and withdrawal by physician due to error in assessing eligibility prior to starting treatment (n=1)\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n12 centres in Australia and 1 centre in New Zealand.\nMarch 2015 to October 2017.\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n\u00a0Ischaemic stroke within 4.5 hours of stroke onset\nEvidence of cerebral vascular occlusion of a large vessel on CT angiography (internal carotid, middle cerebral, basilar artery)\nEligible to undergo IV thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy\nOriginal inclusion criteria required CT-perfusion mismatch for anterior circulation strokes\n\nRatio of >1.2 between volume of hypoperfusion and the volume of the ischamic core, absolute difference in volume >10ml, ischaemic core volume <70ml\nThis criteria was removed after ~80 patients enrolled due to analysis from other trials demonstrating benefit in patients with larger ischaemic-core volumes\n\n\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nPatients with severe pre-existing disability (modified Rankin scale score > 3)\n\n\n202 patients included in analysis\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control groups \u2013 no significant differences\n\nAge: 70.4 vs. 71.9yrs\nMedian NIHSS score: 17 vs. 17\nCause of stroke\n\nCardioembolic: 46% vs. 53%\nLarge artery occlusion: 21% vs. 18%\n\n\nMedian time from stoke onset to IV thrombolysis: 125 vs. 134min\nMedian time from thrombolysis to arterial puncture: 43 vs. 42min\nInter-hospital transfer for thrombectomy: 27% vs. 23%\nSite of vessel occlusion\n\nInternal carotid artery: 24% vs. 24%\nBasilar artery: 3% vs. 3%\nMiddle cerebral artery: 73% vs. 73%\n\n\nMedian volume at initial imaging\n\nIschamic core: 14 vs. 11ml\nPerfusion lesion: 145 vs. 134ml\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nIntravenous tenecteplase\n\n0.25 mg/kg;

Overall functional outcome was better with tenecteplase than with alteplase. There was no significant difference in the incidence of cerebral haemorrhage.\n\nStrengths\n\nAn appropriate and adequately powered non-inferiority study design was chosen to compare treatments.\nA planned superiority analysis was performed following establishment of non-inferiority allowing some conclusions to be drawn regarding the superiority of tenecteplase over alteplase.\nStratification was performed for anatomical clot location.\nAlthough the study used a surrogate outcome as the primary endpoint, functional recovery, mortality and complications were assessed as secondary endpoints.\nThe reperfusion rate in the alteplase arm (10%) was consistent with the previous EXTEND-IA study.\nAssessors of the study outcomes were blinded to allocation.\nAlthough the study enrolled stroke patients at the sicker end of the spectrum, and included larger ischaemic core volumes than previous studies, the administration of thrombolytics appeared to be reasonably safe.\nNo patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDue to differences in drug administration requirements, the study was open label.\nThis was powered as a non-inferiority study so conclusions regarding the superiority of tenecteplase over alteplase cannot be made.\nThe primary outcome was a surrogate endpoint (vessel recanalisation).\nThis was a select group of patients with entry criteria originally requiring CT perfusion-mismatch for anterior circulation strokes.\nThis study was predominantly performed in urban tertiary centres in Australia, with a mean time from stroke onset to thrombolysis of around two hours. This may not make it generalisable to more rural settings or to health care systems with less efficient interventional stroke services.\nThe inclusion criteria for the study with respect to ischaemic core volume was revised in October 2016 due to results from other studies\nIn 6 patients the primary outcome was assessed by perfusion imaging only\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with acute anterior circulatory strokes undergoing thrombolysis prior to embolectomy, tenecteplase was non-inferior to alteplase for achieving >50% reperfusion\nThe more favourable pharmacodynamic properties of tenecteplase, in particular the rapid administration as a single bolus, mean that I would favour it over alteplase for the treatment of ischaemic stroke.\nConclusions regarding the superiority of tenecteplase over alteplase, in terms of cerebral reperfusion, cannot be drawn from this paper and I await the results of an ongoing phase III study.\nThe optimal dose of tenecteplase was not investigated by this study. Further studies comparing 0.25 mg/kg vs. 0.4 mg/kg are awaited in this area.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Study link]\u00a0EXTEND-IA TNK study\n[EXTEND-IA study (same authors)]\u00a0EXTEND-IA study\n[Editorial]\u00a0EXTEND-IA TNK Editorial\n[Further reading]\u00a0REBEL EM: tenecteplase vs. alteplase\n[Further reading]\u00a0MDEdge: tenecteplase vs. alteplase\n[Further reading] Interview with the author\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Fraser Magee @fraz65\nSummary date: 1/5/18\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\n\n\n"
