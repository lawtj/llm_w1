NEJM 2018;379:1431-1442\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with septic shock and severe acute kidney injury, does early vs. delayed renal replacement therapy improve 90 day mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nAcute kidney injury is a common occurrence in patients with septic shock. The decision as to when to start renal replacement therapy is controversial\nThe AKIKI trial reported no difference in mortality with an early vs. a delayed approach, whereas the ELAIN trial found a significant mortality benefit with the early approach\nThere are some key differences between these two randomized trials that are summarized in our previous editorial\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nOpen-label / non-blinded\nComputer generated randomisation, stratification according to age, centre and SOFA score\nIntention to treat analysis\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\n864 patients required to give 80% power, to detect a 10% absolute risk reduction from a baseline mortality of 55%, with a 2 sided alpha level of 0.05\n2 planned interim analyses\nStopped early due to futility\n\nConditional power calculated when trial terminated was 51%\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n29 ICUs in France (22 university teaching hospital and 7 general hospitals)\nData collected July 2012 \u2013 October 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adult patients with septic shock and acute renal failure\n\nSeptic shock defined as severe sepsis with >=2 SIRS criteria and need for vasopressors despite adequate vascular filling\nWithin 48 hours of starting vasopressors\nAcute renal failure defined as \u201cfailure\u201d stage of RIFLE classification i.e. the presence of >=1 of the following:\n\nIncreased creatinine\n\nx3 baseline value, or\n>4 mg/dl (350 umol/l) accompanied by rapid increase\u00a0of >0.5 mg/dl (44 umol/l)\n\n\nOliguria <0.3ml/kg/hr for 12 hours\nAnuria: diuresis <100ml for 12 hours\n\n\n\n\nExclusion: Chronic renal failure requiring dialysis, obstructive renal failure, emergency criteria for immediate haemodialysis (K > 6.5, pH <7.15 or pulmonary oedema by fluid overload), moribund or unlikely to survive to 28 days because of uncontrolled co-morbitiies, DNAR in place\n488 patients randomised out of 1728 who were assessed for eligibility\nComparing intervention vs. control group \u2013 no significant differences in baseline characteristics\n\nAge: 69 vs. 69\nMale: 58% vs. 64%\nChronic renal failure: 13% vs. 18%\nDiabetes: 33% vs. 29%\nSOFA score at enrollement: 12.2 vs. 12.4\nExposure to at least 1 nephrotoxic drug in preceding 4 days: 52% vs. 44%\nInvasive mechanical ventilation: 89% vs. 88%\nVasopressor requirement: 100% vs. 100%\nDiagnostic criteria for \u2018failure\u2019 stage of RIFLE classification\n\nOliguria: 35% vs. 33%\nAnuria: 34% vs. 36%\nSerum creatinine 3 times baseline: 63% vs. 62%\n\n\nFluid balance pre-enrollement ml/24 hour: +3194 vs. +3211\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nEarly initiation of RRT\n\nStart of RRT within 12 hours of documentation of \u2018failure-stage\u2019 acute kidney injury\n97% of patients received RRT\n\n\n\nControl\n\nDeferred initiation of RRT\n\nRRT initiated after a delay of 48 hours post-diagnosis of \u2018failure-stage\u2019 of acute kidney injury, if renal function had not spontaneously recovered or criteria for emergency RRT had been met\n62% of patients received RRT at any time\n17% of patients received RRT earlier than 48 hours due to criteria for emergent RRT being met\n29% did not receive RRT because renal function spontaneosly recovered\n8% died before RRT initiated\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\n\u00a0Choice of RRT (intermittent vs. continuous) was at discretion of clinician, but had to adhere to protocol instructions for setting\n\u2022 In cases of life threatening conditions (K >6.5mmol, metabolic acidosis with pH < 7.15, pulmonary oedema that was refractory to diuretics) within the 48 hours after randomisation, RRT initiated as soon as possible\n\u2022 In case of improvement of renal function within the 48 hours post randomisation (return of spontaneous urine output >1000ml/24hr or >2000ml/hr with diuretics), RRT is not mandatory\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\u00a0 All cause 90 day mortality \u2013 no significant difference\n\n58% in early strategy vs. 54% in delayed, p=0.38\n\n\nSecondary outcomes \u2013 comparing early vs. delayed strategy\n\nSignificantly lower:\n\nMedian time from diagnosis of AKI to RRT\n\n7.6 vs. 51.5 hours, p<0.001\n\n\nDays free of RRT\n\n12 vs. 16, p=0.0006\n\n\nEpisodes of hyperkalaemia\n\n0% vs. 4%, p=0.03\n\n\n\n\nNo significant differences in:\n\nMedian days free of mechanical ventilation: 2 vs. 3\nMedian days free of vasopressors: 16 vs. 17\nMedian length of hospital stay: 23 vs. 23 days\nDependence on RRT amongst survivors at day 90: 2% vs. 3%\nFluid overload: <1% vs.\u00a04%\nSevere bleeding event: 5% vs. 6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with septic shock and severe acute kidney injury there was no difference in mortality for patients assigned to an early compared with a late strategy for renal replacement therapy\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nPatient centered outcome\nIntention to treat analysis\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\nMinimal loss to follow up\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNon-blinded \u2013 unrealistic to blind clinicians but authors could have been blinded during data collection and analysis\nStopped early due to futility with resultant decrease in power\nUse of both continuous and intermittent RRT allowed which is not consistent with practice in UK\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with septic shock and acute kidney injury, this randomized controlled trial that was stopped early due to futility, found no difference in mortality with the use of early vs. delayed renal replacement therapy\nUse of the delayed strategy\u00a0resulted in a reduction of the number of patients that\u00a0required renal replacement therapy\n\nExternal
