DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2208415\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, does a target oxygen saturation of 90%, 94%, or 98% increase days alive and free of mechanical ventilation at 28 days?\n\nBackground\n\nDespite the ubiquity of oxygen therapy in the critical care setting, the optimal oxygenation target remains elusive\nHigher oxygen targets provide a degree of protection against hypoxaemia, but expose patients to the potential harms of a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)\nEven a small survival difference could result in a significant reduction in mortality, given the vast numbers of patients treated with mechanical ventilation\nA number of trials have compared restrictive and liberal oxygen therapy, with more recent trials showing equipoise between the two groups\n\nDesign\n\nSingle centre, cluster-randomised, cluster-crossover trial\nNon-blinded\nPatients assigned to trial from emergency department (ED) or intensive care unit (ICU) at first receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation\nCluster design meant ED and ICU switched to one of three targets every 2 months, in a randomly generated sequence\nThe three oxygen targets were defined as\n\nlower (SpO2 90%; range 88-92%)\nintermediate (SpO2 94%; range 92-96%)\nhigher (SpO2 98%; range 96-100%)\n\n\nThe final 7 days of each period were considered a wash-out period, and were not included in the primary analysis\nPrimary outcome defined as days alive and ventilator free at 28 days\nSole secondary outcome defined as in-hospital death at 28 days\n2250 patients would provide 92% power at alpha level of 0.05 to detect absolute difference of 2 ventilator-free days between any two of the three groups\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre in Nashville USA\nData collection occurred from July 1st 2018 to August 31st 2021\nThere was a 2 month pause due to Covid-19 during April and May 2020\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAll adult patients (>18 years of age)\nLocated in ED or ICU\nRequiring mechanical ventilation\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nPregnant\nIncarcerated\nPatients with Covid-19 were managed on a separate ICU. Those with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis were not included in the primary analysis\n\n\n2987 patients enrolled\n\n446 (14.9%) excluded due to enrolment during washout period, or Covid-19 diagnosis\n\n\nBaseline characteristics of lower vs intermediate vs higher target groups were broadly similar\n\nAge: 57 vs 59 vs 59\nFemale: 44.7% vs 44.8% vs 46.8%\nComorbidities\n\nCOPD: 18.3% vs 20.4% vs 19.3%\nCoronary artery disease: 17.9% vs 17.7% vs\u00a0 20.4%\n\n\nAcute illness\n\nCardiac arrest: 15.5% vs 11.6% vs 12.5%\nMyocardial infarction: 16.8% vs 16.1% vs 16.6%\nSepsis: 34% vs 28.8% vs 32.4%\nReceived vasopressors: 19.8% vs 19.9% vs 17.5%\n\n\nMedian time from initiation of ventilation to enrolment: 0.0 vs 0.0 vs 0.0hr\nSeparation of SpO2 and FiO2 between trial groups occurred\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nLower oxygen target\n\nTarget SpO2 90%; range 88-92%\n\n\nIntermediate oxygen target\n\n\u00a0Target SpO2 94%; range 92-96%\n\n\n\nControl\n\nHigher oxygen target\n\nTarget SpO2 98%; range 96-100%\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nOnly the changes in FiO2 were mandated by the trial protocol\nFiO2 was titrated by respiratory therapists within 15 minutes of assignment to trial\nAll other aspects of patient care, including ventilatory parameters and PEEP, were left to the discretion of the treating clinician\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: number of days alive and free of mechanical ventilation at 28 days \u2013 no significant difference\n\n20 days in lower; 21 days in intermediate and higher\nOdds Ratios\n\nLower vs intermediate: 0.95 (95% CI 0.79-1.13)\nIntermediate vs higher: 1.00 (95% CI 0.84-1.19)\nLower vs intermediate: 0.95 (95% CI 0.78\u20131.14)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome: No significant difference in secondary outcome or numerous prespecified exploratory outcomes\n\nComparing lower vs intermediate vs higher targets\nNo significant difference in 28 day mortality\n\n34.8% vs 34.0% vs 33.2%\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation, days alive and ventilator free did not differ among groups in which lower, intermediate and higher oxygenation targets were used\n\nStrengths\n\nVery large numbers considering this was a single centre trial\nExcellent separation between the three groups\n\nAverage sats achieved for each group 93%, 94% and 97% respectively\nAverage FiO2 administered for each group 0.31, 0.37 an 0.45 respectively\n\n\nUse of SpO2 rather than PaO2 allowed for vast, highly granular data set\n\nNearly 8 million individual saturation readings\n\n\nExcellent overall adherence to SpO2 targets\nCluster crossover format reduces selection bias and reduces time to enrolment\nSequential randomisation over the study period reduces risks of bias due to seasonality\nPatient-centred primary outcome with face validity \u2013 that is, it is relevant to the intervention being tested\nThe choice of primary outcome allows a greater degree of discrimination between interventions than a simple mortality outcome\n\nWeaknesses\n\nA few factors reduce the generalisibility of these results\n\nSingle centre trial\nThe ICU involved did not have surgical patients\nThe trial intervention was implemented by respiratory therapists, a role not present in some settings\nSome unusual baseline characteristics for the patients\n\nFor example, 14% on home oxygen and 3% of patients chronically ventilated. This last group of patients could never achieve the primary outcome\n\n\n\n\nThough separation was good, the target saturations for the lower group were not really met overall, increasing the risk of a beta error\n\nThis is likely due to reaching an FiO2 of 0.21, as occurred in around a 3rd of patients in the lower group\n\n\nThere is a chance that the use of different FiO2s may have introduced clinician bias, affecting their decision to attempt a spontaneous breathing trial and extubation\nThe primary outcome does not discern between dying and being ventilated for 28 days, a difference which would clearly matter to patients\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn this trial of low, intermediate and high oxygen targets, no significant difference was found in days alive and ventilator free at 28 days\nThis excellent trial has challenged my prior inclination towards lower oxygen saturation targets and lower FiO2s. I remain confident in my belief that unnecessarily high FiO2s are harmful, but I will be less aggressive in reducing the FiO2 in the absence of hyperoxia\nThose who use higher targets will be reassured. The chance that there is a large treatment benefit to any particular oxygen target is extremely low\nI will continue to aim for the equivalent of an intermediate target of oxygenation, except in a research setting\nI await the results of Mega-ROX with great anticipation\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle \u00a0Oxygen-Saturations Targets for Critically Ill Adults Receiving Mechanical Ventilation\nfurther viewing Critical Care Reviews PILOT trial presentation\nfurther reading Conservative Oxygen Therapy during Mechanical Ventilation in the ICU\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Omar Jundi @bi0marker\nSummary date: 01/12/22\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\nImage by\u00a0Defence-Imagery\u00a0from\u00a0Pixabay\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
