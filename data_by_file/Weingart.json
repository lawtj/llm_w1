A RCT is warranted, comparing the use of DSI with the use of other techniques for achieving pre-oxygenation, when traditional methods have failed. In the mean time, on the basis of this level 4 evidence I will use the practice of DSI in selected cases.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0Delayed Sequence Intubation: A Prospective Observational Study\n[further reading]\u00a0Preoxygenation, Reoxygenation, and Delayed Sequence Intubation in the Emergency Department by Weingart\n[further reading]\u00a0EmCrit Page \u2013 Everything you need to know about DSI\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date: 3rd November 2014\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n"
