Hypoxemia is dangerous but by the same token hyperoxia can cause absorption atelectasis, acute lung injury, central nervous system toxicity, reduced cardiac output and cerebral and coronary vasoconstriction\nIn the pursuit to, above all, do no harm, it is important to question what is the optimal amount of oxygen our intensive care patients should receive\nAVOID demonstrated no benefit in giving oxygen to normoxic patients with STEMI undergoing PCI, DETO2X showed no difference in one year mortality between room air and oxygen therapy in normoxic patients with suspected AMI,\u00a0OXYGEN-ICU found a striking mortality benefit in those critically ill patients given a conservative oxygen regimen and several stroke trials have suggested a conservative oxygen strategy is non-inferior (the largest being the SO2S trial) to the liberal strategy\nThe ICU-ROX trial has just completed recruiting and results will be reported early next year. This 1000 patient trial of mechanically ventilated ICU patients will compare the effect of giving the smallest amount of inspired oxygen versus standard care on Ventilator Free Days\n\nDesign\n\nSystematic review and meta-analysis\n2 authors conducted a comprehensive search of databases (Cochrane, MEDLINE, Embase, HealthSTAR, LILACS, PapersFirst, WHO trials registry) + reference lists and author contact for missing data\nStandardised data collection form\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nMorbidity was assessed using a random-effects meta-analysis allowing for differences in the treatment effect from study to study (differences in study population, intervention received, follow-up length etc.)\nResults were re-analysed using various statistical techniques, for example, assuming a worse-case scenario for missing participants, reweighing trials using fixed-effect meta-analysis, excluding unpublished trials\nThe quality of the included trials was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool in an attempt to avoid Type I (false-positive) and Type II (false-negative) errors.\n\nTrials Included\n\n25 randomised controlled trials, including 16,037 patients\n\nStroke patients: n=7,795\nMyocardial infarct/cardiac arrest: n=6,306\nCritical care: n=582\nEmergency surgery: n=338\nSepsis: n=50\n\n\n12 trials (n=13,389) excluded patients with hypoxaemia at baseline, whereas all other trials excluded patients if baseline hypoxaemia was severe i.e P/F ratio <100\nMedian follow-up: 3 months (IQR 2-6 months)\nRisk of bias\n\n18 trials deemed low risk\n7 trials deemed high risk\n\n\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: acutely ill adults requiring hospital admission who were randomised to liberal or conservative oxygen strategies and reported outcome of interest (mortality, disability, hospital acquired infections/pneumonia, hospital length of stay)\nExclusion: <18 years, pregnant, chronic respiratory disease trials, psychiatric disease, patients on ECMO, patients with hyperbaric oxygen therapy or elective surgery. Studies solely comparing different oxygen delivery devices\nBaseline characteristics\n\nMedian age: 64\nMale: 64%\nBaseline SpO2 (10 studies): 96.4% in liberal group vs. 96.7% in conservative\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nLiberal oxygen\n\nThe treatment arm with the higher oxygen target, measured by FiO2, PaO2, SaO2 or SpO2\nMedian FiO2 administered 0.52 (IQR 0.39-0.85) for median duration of 8 h (IQR 4-24)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nConservative oxygen\n\nThe group with the lower oxygen target (including room air)\nMedian FiO2 administered 0.21 (IQR 0.21-0.25)\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nRoom air or oxygen was delivered by:\n\nNasal prongs in 4 trials\nFacemask in 13 trials\nInvasive ventilation in 8 trials\n\n\nThese pragmatic trials meant other management was not prescribed\n\nOutcomes\n\nMortality \u2013 significantly increased in liberal oxygen group\n\nComparing liberal vs. conservative groups\n\nIn hospital mortality (available from 19 trials, n=15,071)\n\n\u00a03.7% vs. 3.0%, RR = 1.21 (95% C.I. 1.03-1.43), p=0.020, high quality evidence\n\n\n30 day mortality (available from 14 trials, n=15,053)\n\n6.4% vs. 5.6%, RR = 1.14 (95% C.I. 1.01-1.28), p=0.033, high quality evidence\n\n\nMortality at longest available follow-up (23 trials, n=15,754)\n\n10.5% vs. 9.5%, RR = 1.1 (95% C.I. 1.00-1.20), p=0.044, high quality evidence\n\n\n\n\nMeta-regression demonstrated that as SpO2 increased, liberal oxygen was associated with higher RR in-hospital mortality (14 trials) and higher RR of mortality at longest follow up (15 trials)\n\nFor every 1% increase in SpO2, the relative risk of\n\nIn-hospital mortality increased by 25%\nMortality at longest follow-up increased by 17%.\n\n\n\n\nMean number needed to harm using a liberal oxygen strategy was 71\nThere was low hetereogeneity for the assessment of death with I2=0\n\n\n\n\nDisability after stroke or traumatic brain injury (5 trials) \u2013 no significant difference\n\nProportion of patients with mRS >2: RR 1 (95% C.I. 0.92-1.09)\n\n\n\n\nHospital acquired infections\n\nIn medical patients (7 trials) \u2013 no significant difference\n\nRR 1.04 (95% C.I. 0.94-1.16)\n\n\nFollowing emergency surgery (2 trials) \u2013 significantly reduced in liberal group\n\nRR 0.50 (95% C.I. 0.36-0.69)\nTrial sequential analysis showed that the required information size was not reached to conclusively determine the effect of the intervention\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLength of hospital stay (12 studies) \u2013 no significant difference\n\nMean difference -0.25 days (95% C.I. -0.68 to 0.18)\n\n\nThe hetereogeneity for outcomes other than mortality, were more variable with I2 ranging from 58-67% making the conclusions difficult to assess\nSubgroup analysis\n\nNo significant difference based on:\n\nICU vs. non-ICU setting\nInvasive ventilation vs. non-invasive ventilation\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence that hyperoxia caused by a liberal oxygen strategy increases mortality\n\nStrengths\n\nThe analysis asked a focused clinical question\nThe criteria of the included articles was of a high standard\nIt is unlikely that important studies have been missed because of the comprehensive database trawl\nThe validity of the trials was praised with 2 out of 25 excluded: 1 as it duplicated data from another trial (but at a different timepoint) and 1 as patients could be randomised at different times to different treatment groups\nThe results were similar from study to study, although, alone none of the trials were statistically significant. It is only with the meta-analysis that significance is reached\nThe result is biologically plausible and has a dose response such that higher SpO2 is associated with higher in-hospital and longest follow-up mortality\nThe outcome assessed is clinically important\n\nWeaknesses\n\nWide variety of patients included and not all were ICU patients\nWide variety in intervention and control, with FiO2 in the liberal arm at 100% in some cases\nThe relative weightings placed on each trial is determined by the number of events (in this case deaths): in particular the OXYGEN-ICU trial (Giardis et al) is given 32.1% weight (478 patients) vs say the DETO2X trial at 16.8% (6629 patients). The OXYGEN-ICU trial was imperfect: single-centre, early stopping.\nThe heterogeneity of the secondary outcomes makes it difficult to establish any conclusion regarding these measures\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis adds to the growing body of literature that hyperoxia is dangerous. I will continue to aim for the lowest safest inspired oxygen in my ICU patients and encourage others to titrate FiO2 down if SpO2 >95%.\nI eagerly await the results of the ICU-ROX trial which will be the largest trial of liberal versus restricted O2 in ICU mechanically ventilated patients.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Mortality and morbidity in acutely ill adults treated with liberal versus conservative oxygen therapy (IOTA): a systematic review and meta-analysis\n[further reading]\u00a0Protocol summary and statistical analysis plan for the intensive care unit randomised trial comparing two approaches to oxygen therapy (ICU-ROX)\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford @celiabradford\nSummary date: June 6 2018\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\n\n\n"
