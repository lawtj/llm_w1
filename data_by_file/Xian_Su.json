Lancet 2016; 388:1893-1902\nClinical Question\n\nIn elderly patients following non-cardiac surgery, does a low dose dexmedetomidine infusion, when compared with placebo, decrease the incidence of delirium?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n\nComputer random number generation\nSealed envelopes\n\n\nDouble-blinded\nBlinding of outcome assessors who were not involved in patient care\nSuperiority trial\nParallel arm placebo\nPower calculation: 656 patients required to demonstrate a reduction of one third from baseline incidence of 28%, with a false positive rate of 5% and a false negative rate of 20%\nIntention to treat analysis\nFollow up for 30 days post surgery\n\nSetting\n\n2 tertiary care hospitals in Beijing, China\nData collected: August 2011 \u2013 November 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n\u226565 years old\nElective non-cardiac surgery under General Anaesthetic\nAdmitted to ITU before 20:00 on day of surgery (intubated or extubated)\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nSchizophrenia, Epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s, Myasthenia Gravis\nInability to communicate pre-operatively e.g. dementia, language barrier\nBrain injury or neurosurgery\nPhysiological derangement pre-operatively\n\nLV Ejection Fraction < 30%\nSick sinus syndrome\nSinus bradycardia <50 bpm\n2nd or 3rd degree AV block\nEnd stage renal or hepatic dysfunction\n\n\nLow likelihood of survival for >24 hours\n\n\nParticipant numbers\n\n2016 patients assessed for eligibility. 835 patients eligible, 135 refused participation\n700 patients included in trial;

The differences in sedation requirements may have been due to the addition of dexmedetomidine or they may have been due to an unaccounted confounding variable.\nDexmedetomidine group had increased rates of infusion being reduced in rate or stopped \u2013 no further details are given on these cases\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study demonstrates an impressive reduction in post op delirium with low dose Dexmedetomidine infusion. Further studies needed to clarify if these results can be applied to a wider range of patients, and also to rule out possible safety concerns.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Dexmedetomidine for prevention of delirium in elderly patients after non-cardiac surgery: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial\n[further reading]\u00a0DAHLIA Trial TBL Review\n[further reading]\u00a0Evaluating the transition from dexmedetomidine to clonidine for agitation management in the intensive care unit\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Sarah Nelson\nSummary date:\u00a03rd December 2016\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@davidslessor\n\n\n"
