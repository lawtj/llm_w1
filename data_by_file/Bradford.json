Crit Care Resusc.15(2):119-125\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage does induced hypermagnesaemia reduce the incidence of cerebral artery vasospasm?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nRandomisation stratified by World Federation of Neurosurgical Society Grade of SAH\nVariable block size\nAllocation concealment maintained through use of sealed opaque envelopes\nClinical staff in intensive care non-blinded to treatment allocation\nOutcome assessors and neurosurgical staff blinded to treatment allocation\nSample size calculation: 190 patients would provide 80% power to detect a reduction in the incidence of vasospasm from 60% to 40%\n\nSetting\n\n2 tertiary centres in Australia\nApril 2005 \u2013 December 2009\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nClinical history consistent with aneurysmal SAH occurring within the previous 72 hours\nAneurysmal SAH confirmed on CT\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nAge <18; creatinine >200mmol/L; death thought imminent within 72 hours; myasthenia gravis; pregnancy; cerebral vasospasm present before inclusion\n\n\n162 patients randomised\n\nComparing intervention to control group:\n\nAge (mean) 55.8 vs. 56.6\nAneurysm size <5mm: 27.1% vs. 34%\nAneurysm size >10mm: 22% vs. 8%\nGCS on admissiona (mean): 12.3 vs. 12.4\nWFNS grade:\n\n1: 48.1% vs. 42%\n2: 23.5% vs. 28.4%\n3: 2.5% vs. 3.7%\n4: 11.1% vs. 13.6%\n5: 44.9% vs. 58%\n\n\nHydrocephalous present: 44.9% vs. 58%\nAPACHE II (mean): 14.1 vs. 13.4\n\nIntervention\n\nHigh target range for serum magnesium (1.60-2.50 mmol/L)\n\nMean serum magnesium in intervention group during study period: 1.70\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard target range for serum magnesium (0.65-1.05 mmol/L)\n\nMean serum magnesium in control group during study period: 0.87\n\n\n\nIn both intervention and control groups\n\nPatients received an IV infusion of magnesium sulphate at a constant rate of 20ml/hr; the concentration was adjusted to achieve the target concentration.\nThe trial intervention was discontinued 12 days post original haemorrhage or on discharge from ICU, or if death thought to be imminent.\nManagement of SAH based upon standard treament strategies\n\nWherever possible, ruptured aneurysms secured by surgical or endovascualr treatment within 48 hours\nAll patients received nimodipine\nBP supported with noradrenaline aiming for systolic BP of 120-160mmHg once aneurysm secure.\nPatients underwent cerebral angiography on day 5, or earlier if they developed clinical signs of suggestive of vasospasm.\nClinically relevant vasospasm treated with chemical or balloon angioplasty and angiography was repeated daily until vasospasm resolved\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Incidence of cerebral arterial vasospasm diagnosed by digital subtraction angiography and adjusted for baseline characteristics \u2013 No significant difference\n\nOdds Ratio 0.51 (95% C.I. 0.26-1.02, P=0.06)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: No significant difference\n\nGlasgow outcome score at 90 days\nModified rankin score at 90 days\nProportion of patients requiring endovascular treatment for vasospasm\nDuration of ICU stay\n\n\nTertiary outcomes\n\nMedian amount of noradrenaline administered was significantly higher in the intervention group\nThe mean serum calcium concentration was significantly lower in the intervention group\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nTargeting high-range magensium levels in patients with SAH decreased vasospasm, but this was not statistically significant\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nAllocation concealment maintained\nBlinding of assessors of primary outcome\nGood separation of magnesium level between intervention and control group\nIntention to treat analysis\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnder powered\nICU clinicians non-blinded\nDid not assess level of agreement (Kappa score) between assessors of primary outcome\nDid not record BP of patients in study. Any differences may have influenced results.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis underpowered study found a non-significant reduction in vasospasm post SAH in patients treated with\u00a0hypermagnesaemia. Larger trials will be required to determine if there is a significant difference and if this is results in improvements in patient-orientated outcomes.\n\nCompeting Interests\n\nThe lead author is an editor for The Bottom Line.
