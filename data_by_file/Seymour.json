NEJM 2017; 376: 2235-2244\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, does a faster time to completion of a 3 hour bundle of care, compared with a slower time, affect in hospital mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nSepsis is a life threatening condition with high mortality\nSepsis \u201cbundles\u201d combining high impact interventions have been popularised since the 2000s, with the most notable being the Early Goal Directed Therapy (EGDT) approach which became part of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC)\nThese bundles usually include early antibiotics, source control, and rapid haemodynamic resuscitation\nNew York City made their sepsis bundle mandatory in 2013\n\nDesign\n\nRetrospective observational study using the New York Department of Health Database\nRisk adjustment model for in-hospital mortality designed using confounding variables\n\nAge\nEthnicity\nSource of funding\nCo-morbidities\nSite of infection\nAdmission source\nMeasures of illness severity (shock, lactate, platelet count, mechanical ventilation)\n\n\n90% of cohort used to develop model\nAccuracy of model tested on remaining 10% \u2013 AUROC 0.77\nOther models created:\n\nExcluding patients who had element of 3 hour bundle given before protocol activated\nExcluding Patients discharge to hospice care and classified \u201cdead\u201d on discharge\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n185 Hospitals in New York State Department of Health database\nApril 2014 \u2013 June 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAge >17 years\nSevere sepsis or septic shock as defined by 2001 International Sepsis Definitions Conference (Sepsis-2)\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nCompletion of 3 hour bundle >12 hours after initiating protocol\nBundle contraindicated\nAdvanced directives limiting treatment\nPatient declined intervention\nPatient already in another clinical trial\n36 Hospitals excluded as they saw <50 cases of sepsis\n\n\n111,816 patients screened, 49,337 eligible\nComparing intervention vs control, there were some significant differences between groups:\n\nMedian age: 73 vs 71\nFemale sex: 47.1% vs 51.8%\nWhite race: 67.8% vs 63.3%\nBlack race: 15.9% vs 20.6%\nAsian race: 4.4% vs 4.6%\nOther race: 11.9% vs 11.5%\nChronic respiratory disease: 11.4% vs 12.5%\nCongestive heart failure: 20.4% vs 20.6%\nEnd stage renal disease: 10.1 vs 12.7%\nAdmitted from home: 67.1% vs 71.3%\nAdmitted from skilled nursing facility: 27.6% vs 23%\nUrinary infection: 26.9% vs 28.7%\nRespiratory infection: 41.3% vs 35.4%\nGastrointestinal infection:8.8% vs 12.4%\nOther infection: 23.0% vs 23.8%\nPositive blood cultures: 30.3% vs 26.1%\nMedian lactate: 2.8 vs 2.5\nSeptic shock: 45.2% vs 45.7%\nTeaching facility: 19.0% vs 84.5%\nIn hospital death: 22.6% vs 23.6%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n3 hour bundle:\n\nBlood cultures before antibiotics\nMeasurement of lactate\nAdministration of broad spectrum antibiotics\n\n\n6 hour bundle:\n\n30ml/kg fluid bolus in patients with hypotension or a lactate >4meq/l\nVasopressors for refractory hypotension\nRe-measurement of lactate within 6 hours of starting protocol\n\n\n\nIf any element of the 3 hour bundle\u00a0was performed before the \u201cofficial start\u201d of the sepsis protocol, the patient was considered to have adhered to the protocol with regard to that element within the first hour\nControl\n\nDid not have 3 hour bundle completed within the time set\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: In hospital mortality\n\nOdds ratio of dying increased by 1.04 per hour delay of completing bundle (CI 1.03 to 1.06; P=<0.001)\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nGiving antibiotics through hours 3-12: Odds ratio of dying 1.14, compared to administering within hours 0.3 (CI 1.06 to 1.22, P=<0.001)\nDelaying fluid bolus: Odds ratio per hour of delay 1.01 (CI 0.99 to 1.02, P=0.21)\nDelaying blood cultures: odds ratio per hour of delay 1.04 (CI 1.02 to 1.06, P=<0.001)\nMultiple sensitivity analyses performed:\n\nreclassifying patients by time to arrival to ED \u2013 no difference\nReclassifying discharge as death \u2013 no difference\nExcluding patients with parts of the bundle started before inclusion \u2013 no difference\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nMore rapid completion of a 3-hour bundle of sepsis care and rapid administration of antibiotics, but not rapid completion of an initial bolus of intravenous fluids, were associated with lower risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality\n\nStrengths\n\nImportant clinical question\nLarge data set\nMultiple centres\nReal world \u201cpragmatic\u201d data\nMultiple statistical analyses performed to minimise confounders\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThis is observational data and thus can only describe associations\nLarge confounders remain, particularly the \u201cHawthorne effect\u201d \u2013 units with better compliance with the bundle may function better overall, rather than the bundle itself being effective\n\nThis is suggested by the fact that taking blood cultures early was associated with reduced mortality, and taking blood cultures is not a treatment\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study demonstrates an association between a delay in administering a 3 hour bundle of care and increased mortality in a large cohort of patients in New York\nThis does not change my current practice of delivering high impact interventions in sepsis as early as possible\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Seymour CW et al.\u00a0Time to treatment and Mortality During Mandated Emergency Care for Sepsis\n[blog commentary].
