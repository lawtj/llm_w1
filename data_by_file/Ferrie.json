Journal Parenter Enteral Nutr\u00a02016;40:795-805. doi: 10.1177/0148607115618449\nClinical Question\n\n\u00a0In critically ill adult patients\u00a0receiving parenteral nutrition, does high amino acid intake compared with standard level amino acid intake, result in greater hand grip strength at ICU discharge?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nConsecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes with weekly auditing to ensure allocation concealment maintained\nVarying block size\nDouble blind\nPower calculation\n\n96 participants were required at a power of 80% and an alpha of 0.05 to detect a 6kg difference in hand grip strength between the two groups, from a baseline grip strength of 14.68kg\nRecruitment goal increased to 120 patients prior to study commencement to allow for dropouts\n\n\nPrimary outcome changed prior to study commencement from nitrogen balance to handgrip strength due to the concern with missing data if nitrogen balance was used\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre tertiary mixed medical/surgical ICU, Australia\nData collected over 12 months from\u00a02013-2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria: All patients admitted to the ICU who required parental nutrition (PN)\nExclusion criteria: Younger than 16 years old; were not expected to require intervention for at least 3 days; had recently received significant nutrition in past 3 days via enteral nutrition (EN) or PN\n217 patients were screened, 137 were approached for inclusion, 120 were randomised\nComparing baseline characteristics of high protein vs. standard protein groups \u2013 no significant differences\n\nMedian age: 67.0 vs. 64.5\nAPACHE II score: 25.5 vs. 23.7\nSOFA score: 9.4 vs. 9.2\nNutritional risk screening 2002 score : 4.3 vs. 3.9\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nHigh protein parenteral nutrition \u2013 daily amino acid target of 1.2g/kg\n\nBaxter Olimel N9\n\n1070 calories/litre\n9g protein/litre\n57g amino acids/litre\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard protein parenteral nutrition \u2013\u00a0daily amino acid target of 0.8g/kg\n\nOli-Clinomel N7\n\n1200 calories/litre\n40g protein/litre\n7 grams amino acids/litre\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon management\n\nPN solution delivered for 10 days or until ICU discharge\nPN delivered via central line\nVitamins and trace elements provided to meet Australian recommendations\nNutrition assessment conducted by the dietitian, with an energy aim of 26 kcal/kg in the lower protein group and 24 kcal/kg in the higher protein group.\nCurrent body weight was used for patients with a BMI between 20-30 kg/m2, and adjusted to 20 kg/m2 for underweight and 27.5 kg/m2 for overweight patients\nAnthropometric measurements were standardised and completed by the same researcher for internal validity.\n\nComparing nutrition achieved during study period between high protein and standard protein groups:\n\nDays on parental nutrition (median): 9.5 vs. 10\nCalories \u2013 significantly less in high protein group\n\nPer day in 1st 3 days: 23.5 vs. 26.0, p=0.002\nPer day in 1st 7 days: 23.1 vs. 24.9, p=0.001\n\n\nAmino acids \u2013 significantly more in high protein group\n\nPer day in 1st 3 days: 1.17g/kg vs. 0.87g/kg, p<0.001\nPer day in 1st 7 days: 1.09g/kg vs. 0.90g/kg, p<0.001\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\u00a0Hand grip strength at ICU discharge \u2013 no significant difference\n\nComparing high protein vs. standard protein group\n\n18.5kg (10.4 Standard deviation) vs. 15.8 (10.3SD) kg, p=0.054\n10% of patients lost to follow-up\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nComparing high protein vs. standard protein groups\n\nHand grip strength at day 7 \u2013 significantly improved in high protein group\n\n22.1kg (10.1 SD) vs. 18.5kg (11.8 SD), 0=0.025\n\n\nNitrogen balance\n\nAt day 3 \u2013 significantly less in standard protein group\n\n-0.5g/d vs. -5.6g/d, p<0.0001\n\n\nAt day 7 \u2013 no significant difference\n\n\u00a0-4.9g/d vs. -4.7g/d, p=0.92\n\n\n\n\nFatigue score at day 7 (Chalder scale) \u2013 significantly\u00a0reduced\u00a0 in high protein group\n\n5.4 vs. 6.2, p=0.045\n\n\nSum of 3 muscle sites on ultrasound on day 7 \u2013 significantly higher in high protein group\n\n8.4cm vs. 7.9cm, p=0.02\n\n\nVentilator days \u2013 no significant difference\n\n2 vs. 2\n\n\nICU mortality \u2013 no significant difference\n\n8% vs. 6%, p=0.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe delivery of higher amino acids to critically ill patients demonstrated small differences in various measures that may be clinically meaningful\n\nStrengths\n\nThis is the first RCT on this topic\nAppropriate randomisation method and concealment of allocation has minimised selection bias\nIt has include a suite of functional and nutrition status outcome measures which may be important for future nutrition trials\nDouble blinded\nRecorded energy/protein from other sources e.g. enteral nutrition, propofol\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe trial did not achieve the target amino acid delivery difference between the two groups, thus, the actual difference in amino acid delivery was small.\nThere was an energy delivery difference between the 2 groups, particularly in the first 3 days. As energy and protein are likely to have a synergistic effect, this is difficult to interpret how this might affect the results.\nThere was a significant loss of data at discharge for primary and secondary outcome variables. This highlights the difficulty in getting such measures in ICU nutrition or function trials.\nSingle centre\nChange in primary outcome\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn critically ill adults patients receiving parenteral nutrition, this trial did not show any difference in hand grip strength at ICU discharge, with\u00a0amino acid delivery of 1.1g/kg vs 0.9g/kg. \u00a0Changes in other outcomes were minor, with differences disappearing later in ICU admission or failing to reach statistical significance. This is a small study and practice changes can not be recommended. It will be interesting to explore in larger trials if any of these changes in functional or muscle outcomes reach clinical or statistical significance. A very hot topic for the future.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Protein Requirements in the Critically Ill: A Randomized Controlled Trial Using Parenteral Nutrition.\n[further reading]\u00a0Pragmatic approach to nutrition in the ICU: Expert opinion regarding which calorie protein target\n[further reading]\u00a0ESPEN Guidelines on Parenteral Nutrition: Intensive care\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Emma Ridley\nSummary date:\u00a017th April 2017\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\n\n\n"
