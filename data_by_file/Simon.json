Respir Care 2016;61(9):1160-7. DOI: 10.4187/respcare.04413\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult critically ill patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure necessitating intubation, does high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) compared to bag-valve-mask (BVM) for both pre-oxygenation and oxygenation during intubation reduce desaturation?\n\nBackground\n\nThe process of induction of anaesthesia and intubation has inherent risks, and these are greatest in critically ill patients\nPublished data suggest up to a quarter of patients suffer a significant complication, and a quarter of these complications are due to severe hypoxia\nA variety of strategies are used to provide pre-oxygenation, including face masks with reservoir bags, non-invasive ventilation, BVM devices and HFNC devices, but trials comparing these have not demonstrated a clearly superior strategy\nMore recently the PROTRACH study has been published\n\nDesign\n\nSingle center prospective, randomised clinical trial\nRandomised by computer-generated random number sequence allocation\nAllocation concealed by opaque sequential envelopes\nParallel assignment in 1:1 ratio\nSingle blinded: Clinicians aware, study team blinded to intervention\nSample size calculated to detect a 3% difference in minimal oxygen saturation; with a false negative rate of 20% and a false positive rate of 5%\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nRegistered with clinicaltrials.gov\nArterial blood gases collected at pre-defined time points: baseline, after 3 minutes pre-oxygenation, immediately after intubation, and 5 and 30 minutes post intubation\nBoard certified intensivists performed all intubations\nComparison between 2 groups was performed using t test for continuous data and chi-squared test for categorical data\n\nSetting\n\n11 departmental intensive care units at University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendor\nJanuary 2014 to November 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\u00a0 adult patients with hypoxic respiratory failure (PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mmHg) requiring intubation\nExclusion criteria:\n\ncontra-indications for BVM or HFNC\nnasopharyngeal obstruction or blockage\nemergency endotracheal intubation\nsuspected or know difficult airway\n\n\n773 patients screened \u2013 40 patients enrolled\nComparing baseline characteristics of BVM vs HFNC groups respectively\n\nNo significant differences in:\n\nSAPS II score: 37 vs. 37\nBMI: 27 vs. 25\nPrimary Surgical Patients: 95% vs. 75%\nHospitalization due to malignant or non-malignant abdominal process: 90% vs. 80%\nMean P/F at baseline: 205 vs. 200mm Hg\nMean SpO2 at baseline: 94% vs. 96%\nType of oxygen therapy at baseline:\n\nLow flow nasal cannula: 70% vs. 55%\nLow Flow via Face Mask: 15% vs. 5%\nHFNC:\u00a0 5% vs. 25%\nNoninvasive ventilation 10% vs. 15%\n\n\n\n\nAge \u2013 significantly older in HFNC group\n\n54 yrs. vs. 63 yrs., p=0.02\n\n\n\n\nComparing characteristics of intubation procedure in BVM vs. HFNC group\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nDuration of intubation; 37s vs. 30s\nCormack-Lehane Grade: 2 vs. 1\nPEEP just after intubation: 8 vs. 8\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nHigh-Flow Nasal Cannula Device (HFNC)\n\nPre-oxygenation with FiO2 1.0 with oxygen flow set to 50 L/min and left in place during intubation\n\n\n\nControl\n\nBag-Valve-Mask Device (BVM)\n\nWithout PEEP valve\nPre-oxygenation oxygen flow rate 10L/min\nNo manual insufflations during apnoeic period\nRemoved immediately prior to intubation\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nPreoxygenation Phase: 3 minutes followed by rapid sequence induction\nApnoeic Phase: rapid sequence induction used sufentanil, propofol and rocuronium lasting 1 minute followed by intubation\nIntubation by direct laryngoscopy\nInitial ventilator settings: pressure control mode with an FiO2 1.0\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Mean lowest SpO2 during intubation was not significantly different\n\nBVM: 86% (SD \u00b111%)\nHFNC: 89% (SD \u00b118%)\nAbsolute difference: 3% (95% CI -6.55% to +12.55%; P = 0.56)\n\n\nSecondary Outcomes\n\nPre-oxygenation\n\nBVM significant improved SpO2 from 94% at baseline to 98% (P = 0.004)\nHFNC significantly improved SpO2 from 95% to 99% only in a subset of patients receiving low flow oxygen prior to HFNC (P = 0.007)\n\n\nApnoeic Period\n\nSpO2 significantly dropped in BVM group compared to pre-oxygenated level (P = 0.001)\nSpO2 did not significantly drop in HFNC group compared to pre-oxygenation level (P = 0.17)\n\n\nNo difference between two groups at any predefined points for SpO2, PaO2/FiO2, and PaCO2\n5 subjects in each group desaturated to <80%\n2 cases in each group aborted during the pre-oxygenation or apnea phase due to profound hypoxia\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThis trial found no significant difference in SpO2 between BVM and HFNC during intubation in adult patients with hypoxic respiratory failure\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised trial with treatment allocation being concealed \u2013 minimises selection bias\nA uniform intubation procedure with respect to duration of the intubation procedure, use of expert clinicians, medication usage and complication rates \u2013 minimising procedural co-founders\nRegistered with clinicaltrials.gov\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPowered to detect a 3% difference in lowest oxygen levels\n\nThis is not a patient centred outcome and arguably it is not a clinically relevant difference\nAs they were investigating the difference in a continuous variable only a small number of patients were required to achieve this power\nA significantly greater number of patients would be required to investigate a dichotomous outcome, such as their secondary outcome of proportion of patients with severe hypoxia (SpO2 <80%)\n\n\nWide confidence intervals in primary outcome include clinically significant differences\nSingle center\nSurgical population with abdominal pathology \u2013 difficult to generalise\nPatient population not equivalent on all baseline characteristics\nStatistical analysis performed assumed normal distributed data\n\nHowever, the data is not normally distributed, SpO2 maximum value is 100%, and a non-parametric analysis is more appropriate for this study\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis randomised controlled trial in adult critically ill patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure necessitating intubation reported that the use of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) compared to bag valve mask (BVM) for both pre-oxygenation and oxygenation during intubation, did not reduce desaturation during intubation\nAlthough this was a well-executed study, due to inappropriate statistical analysis and the small number of patients included, a generalisable conclusion cannot be made\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] High-Flow Nasal Cannula Versus Bag-Valve-Mask for Preoxygenation Before Intubation in Subjects With Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure\n[further reading]\u00a0Correspondence to trial team\n[further reading]\u00a0EMNerd: the case of the false dichotomy\n\nMetadata\nName: Stephen Huelskamp\nDate written: 28 Feb 2019\nPeer-review: Duncan Chambler and David Slessor\n\n\n"
