Chest 2007; 131:954\u201363.\nClinical Question\n\n\nIn patients with early ARDS, does continuous methylprednisolone compared to placebo reduce lung injury scores within 7 days?\n\n\nDesign\n\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\n2:1 block computer-generated randomisation\nDouble blinded until analysis\n\n\nSetting\n\n\nMulti-centre study in Memphis, USA\nApril 1997 to April 2002\n\n\nPopulation\n\n\nInclusion: Adults that met ARDS diagnostic criteria (American-European Consensus definition)\nExclusion: Already on steroid therapy, or steroids contra-indicated, morbid obesity, burns, severe liver disease.\n500 assessed of which 91 randomised\n\n\nIntervention\n\n\n28 days of methylprednisolone in tapering dosage\n\n1mg/kg loading dose, followed by 1 mg/kg/day for 14 days, then 0.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days, 0.25 mg/kg/day for 4 days and finally 0.123 mg/kf/day for 3 days.\nGiven as continuous intravenous infusion until able to take a single oral dose daily.\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\n\n0.9% saline or oral placebo\n\n\nOutcome\n\n\nPrimary outcome: 1-point improvement in Lung Injury Score (LIS) was seen in 69% of those treated with methylprednisolone versus 35.7% of those who received placebo (p=0.002)\nSecondary outcomes: Mean LIS scores 2.14+/-0.12 vs 2.68+/-0.14 (p=0.004) favouring methylprednisolone. Number of patients breathing without assistance 54% vs 25% (p=0.01)\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\nGlucocorticoid treatment-induced down-regulation of systemic inflammation in ARDS is associated with a significant improvement in pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction and a reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay.\n\n\nStrengths\n\n\nDouble blinded\nIntention-to-treat analysis with only 13% drop-out (which is less than between group difference in outcome)\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\n\nGroup sequential clinical trial will bias toward positive outcome\nA baseline difference between groups existed regarding \u201ccatecholamine-dependent shock\u201d, which was twice as high in the placebo group (p=0.03). This would favour a positive outcome with the intervention, due to poorer outcomes in the placebo group.\nOpen-label treatment with methylprednisolone for all non-responders at days 7\u20139 confuses the findings.\nUnderpowered to detect statistically significant difference in mortality, which may be more clinically relevant than lung injury scores.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\nPatients with ARDS should not be given early methylprednisolone based on this study alone, due to methodological concerns.\n\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf / abstract / doi:\u00a010.1378/chest.06-2100\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\n\nSalluh.
