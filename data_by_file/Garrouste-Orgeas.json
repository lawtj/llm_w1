JAMA 2019;(3)229-239. doi:10.1001/jama.2019.9058\nClinical Question\n\nIn intensive care patients, does an ICU diary compared to no ICU diary, reduce post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms at 3 months?\n\nBackground\n\nMental health disorders are common in both patients and their relatives following an ICU stay\nImpaired recall accompanied by delusions may contribute to the post traumatic stress\nKeeping a diary for patients on the ICU may prevent post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms\nThe DRIP study found that family authored diaries for patients in intensive care significantly reduced the risk of post-traumatic symptoms in relatives, but made no significant differences to patients\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n\nWeb based random number generator, block sizes of 4\nStratified by centre\n\n\nOutcomes assessed by:\n\nPsychologist who was blinded to intervention group\nTelephone follow up at 3 months\n\n\nMonitoring of diaries performed by local leads and co-ordinating centre\nSample size: 352 patients required at 3 months to detect a reduction from 40% in the control group to 26% difference in the intervention group for the primary outcome with a false positive rate of 5% and a false negative rate of 20%\nModified intention to treat analysis \u2013 for primary outcome, analysis sets included patients with a complete IES-R score at 3 months\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\n\nSetting\n\n35 Intensive Care Units in France\n\nICUs had to have > 8 beds\nPhysician leaders were members of the French Society of Intensive Care or French Society of Anaesthesiology\n3 of the ICUs were routinely using an ICU diary before the beginning of the trial\n\n\nData collected: October 2015 \u2013 January 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nAge >=18 years\nMechanically ventilated for at least 48 hours that was initiated within 48 hours of ICU admission\nHave a family member available for visiting during ICU stay\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nPre-admission diagnosis of psychosis or dementia\nAcute neurological diseases, cardiac arrest at admission, mute or deaf, status considered highly likely to lead to death or withdrawal of life support within 48 hours\n\n\n657 patients randomised, 402 patients alive at 3 months, and 339 assessed at 3 months after ICU discharge\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nAge (median): 62.5 vs. 61years\nMale: 67% vs. 59%\nSAPS II (median): 51.5 vs. 53\nMedical patient: 74% vs. 79%\nICU events\n\nPhysical constraint: 74% vs. 72%\nDelirium: 34% vs. 33%\nWeaning failure & re-intubation: 7% vs. 7%\n\n\nDuration of mechanical ventilation (median): 9 vs. 9 days\nDuration of ICU stay (median): 14 vs. 14 days\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of family members included in the study in intervention vs. control group\n\nAge: 57 vs. 55\nMale: 26% vs. 31%\nSpouse/partner of patient: 56% vs. 55%\nChild of patient: 30% vs. 31%\nEducational level \u2013 degree: 35% vs. 34%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nICU\u00a0diary\n\nCompleted by clinicians & family members\n1st page of diary is standardised explanation of the purpose of diary\nOnly instruction to the families & staff members about diary entries is to refrain from writing about confidential matters that could not be shared amongst the patients, staff & relatives\nAs a minimum, ICU staff write a brief entry at each weekly staff meeting. Prior to transfer out of the ICU, a concluding note was written by an ICU clinician\nPatients discharged to the ward are given their diaries. If the patient dies the diary is given to the family\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNo ICU diary completed\n\nPatients received usual ICU Care\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nSignificant post traumatic stress disorder symptoms at 3 months, defined as Impact Event Scale-Revised score >22 (range 0-88; higher scores indicate more severe symptoms)\n\nNo significant difference\n29.9% in intervention group vs. 34.3% in control group\nRisk difference -4% (95% C.I. -15 to 6%), p=0.39\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: Comparing\u00a0intervention vs. control group\n\nNo significant difference in\n\nMedian IES-R score\n\n12 (IQR 5-25) vs. 13 (6-27), p=0.38\n\n\nSymptoms of anxiety in patients: 31% vs. 31%, p=0.91\nSymptoms of depression in patients: 19% vs 24%, p=0.35\nNumber of family members with IES-R sore >22: 48% vs. 45%, p=0.53\nPresence of anxiety in family members (HADS-Anxiety score >8): 50% vs. 47%, p=0.56\nPresence of depression on family members (HADS-Depression score >8): 25% vs. 24%, p=0.77\n\n\nMultivariate analysis found that the occurrence of an unexpected cardiac arrest, emotional memories and delusional memories of the ICU stay were significantly associated with an IES-R score >22 in patients\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe use of an ICU diary did not significantly reduce the number of patients that reported significant PTDS symptoms at 3 months\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nOutcomes assessed by psychologists who was blinded to treatment intervention\nMulti-centre\nRegistered with clinicaltrials.gov\nControl centre performed content analysis of a random sample of diaries\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSymptoms of PTSD, anxiety & depression were not assessed at baseline\nDid not meet sample size, and control rate of post-traumatic stress disorder was lower than anticipated\nStudy only performed in France limits generalisability. Rate of physical constraint is much higher than in many UK units\nOnly studied one type of ICU diary\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis randomized controlled trial demonstrated that an ICU diary completed by clinicians & family members did not reduce significant symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder at 3 months, in patients in France\nFurther studies are needed to demonstrate if an ICU diary offers any other benefits, or if a different form of an ICU diary would be of advantage\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of an ICU Diary on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms Among Patients Receiving Mechanical Ventilation: A Randomized Clinical Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0The effect of family-authored diaries on posttraumatic stress disorder in intensive care unit patients and their relatives: A randomised controlled trial (DRIP-study)\n[further reading] ICU-diary.org\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 3rd October 2019\nPeer-review editor: @duncanchambler\n\n\n"
