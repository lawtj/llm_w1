New England Journal of Medicine August 1st 2019; 381:5; 420-431. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1900100\nClinical Question\n\nIn African children presenting to hospital with severe anaemia, is a blood transfusion volume of 30 ml/kg superior to 20 ml/kg in reducing 28 day mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nSevere anaemia is a major cause of death and morbidity in sub-Saharan African children\nBlood products are a scarce resource in most African countries\nWorld Health Organisation guidelines recommend a 20 ml/kg blood transfusion for children with profound anaemia (<4g/dL) or life-threatening severe anaemia (4 to 6 g/dL)\nThis may under estimate transfusion requirements\nIt is possible that a higher transfusion volume may reduce the need for further transfusions, and the associated risk of transfusions from multiple donors\nThis is the first prospective study to investigate whether a 30 ml/kg blood transfusion is superior to a 20 ml/kg transfusion\nImmediate versus delayed transfusion was also investigated as part of this study\u00a0TRACT study immediate vs. delayed transfusion\n\nDesign\n\nOpen-label, multi-centre, factorial, randomised trial\nChildren were stratified by centre and according to illness severity\nChildren with profound anaemia (< 4 g/dL and/or severity features) were randomised to 30 ml/kg or 20 ml/kg\nIn children with a haemoglobin level of 4-6 g/dL and no severity features, randomisation to immediate or delayed transfusion groups took place initially, as part of the factorial design\nOnly those children randomised to the immediate transfusion arm were included in this part of the study\nGroups were analysed on an intention to treat basis\nPower calculation performed to detect a 30% relative difference in 28-day mortality (13.7% in 20ml/kg group and 9.6% in 30 ml/kg group) with 80% power and alpha significance of 0.013 (0.05 \u00f7 4 for multiple testing of four interventions), assuming 6% lost to follow-up\n10 subgroup analysis were pre-specified in the study protocol\nThe factorial study design also investigated three other randomised analyses: immediate compared with no immediate transfusion, administration of post-discharge micronutrients, and post-discharge prophylaxis with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole\n\nSetting\n\nThree hospitals in Uganda and one in Malawi\nSeptember 2014 to May 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Children aged between 2 months and 12 years of age admitted to hospital with complicated, severe anaemia and uncomplicated, severe anaemia after randomisation to immediate or delayed transfusion as part of factorial study design\n\nComplicated, severe anaemia defined as a haemoglobin level of < 4 g/dL OR < 6 g/dL AND reduced consciousness, respiratory distress, acute haemoglobinuria, sickle cell disease or a combination of these features\nUncomplicated severe anaemia defined as a haemoglobin level of 4-6 g/dL without signs of severity\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nChronic disease (kidney or liver failure, malignant conditions, heart failure, congenital heart disease)\nChildren admitted with burns, trauma or surgery\nChildren who had already received a transfusion during the primary hospitalisation\nInfants exclusively breastfed\n\n\n3,199 children were randomised\n\n3 children had consent refused\n7 children died before the start of transfusion and 1 child had a lost health form\n2,418 (75.7%) children had a haemoglobin level of < 4 g/dL\n1,137 (35.6%) had two or more severity features\n64.1% of children had malaria\nAlmost 40% of children had a temperature of greater than 37.5 degrees at baseline\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n30 ml per kilogram of whole blood equivalent (15 ml per kilogram of packed red cells)\n\nControl\n\n20 ml per kilogram of whole blood equivalent (10 ml per kilogram of packed red cells)\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nWhole-blood cells transfused over a period of 3-4 hours\nPacked cells transfused over 2-3 hours\nEnrollment was suspended if blood was unavailable\nAdditional transfusions permitted for new or persistent haemoglobin levels of < 4 g/dL or severity features if the haemoglobin level remained below 6g/dL\nSecond transfusions followed the initial randomised volume\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: No difference in 28-day mortality between the two groups\n\n30 ml/kg: 55 children out of 1,592 (3.4%) died by day 28\n20 ml/kg: 72 children out of 1,596 (4.5%) died by day 28\nHazard ratio: 0.76 (95% CI 0.54\u20131.08; p=0.12)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nNo difference in death at 48 hours (2.0% vs. 2.1%), 90 days (5.8% vs. 7.1%), or 180 days (8.4% vs. 9.6%; overall p value 0.12)\nTime until hospital discharge shorter in the intervention arm than the control arm (HR 1.12; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.20)\nCorrection of anaemia (a haemoglobin level of > 9 g/dL) during the primary hospitalisation was higher in the intervention arm, when compared with the control arm (42.4% vs. 21.8%)\nRepeat transfusions were lower in the 30 ml/kg group (12.4% vs. 18.8%; 95% CI for the absolute difference: 3.9-8.9)\nHospital readmission within 180 days occurred in 301 children (18.8%) in the higher-volume group and in 278 children (17.4%) in the lower-volume group (HR 1.08; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.27)\nNo difference in adverse events\nMinimal cost difference in economic analysis ($80.62 in higher-volume group and $81.97 in lower-volume group)\n\n\nOf the ten pre-specified subgroups analyses, only body temperature showed significant heterogeneity between the intervention and control groups\n\nIn 1943 children (60.8%) with a body temperature of 37.5\u00b0C or less at screening, 24 of 963 (2.5%) in the higher-volume group and 56 of 980 (5.7%) in the lower-volume group died by 28 days (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.69)\nIn contrast, in 1253 children (39.2%) with fever at screening, 31 of 635 (4.9%) in the higher-volume group and 16 of 618 (2.6%) in the lower-volume group died by 28 days (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.04 to 3.49)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\u201cIn this large, multi-centre trial involving children with severe anaemia, we observed no overall evidence of differences in mortality at 48 hours, 28 days, or 180 days between those receiving a transfusion volume approximately one third higher than recommended (30 ml per kilogram) and those receiving the recommended volume (20 ml per kilogram)\u201d.\n\nStrengths\n\nLarge multi-centre randomised controlled trial assessing an important clinical question\nMinimal loss to follow-up despite the resource-poor setting (over 95% follow-up rate)\nGroups were well-matched at baseline\nIntention to treat analysis used\nPrimary outcome was patient-centred\nAppropriate power calculation performed\nThe subgroup analysis of heterogeneity of outcomes with respect to the presence or absence of fever may be hypothesis-generating for a future study\n\nWeaknesses\n\nExpected mortality was over-estimated and this resulted in an under-powered study\nBetween group separation may not have been sufficient to detect a meaningful difference\nThe open-label nature of the study may have introduced bias\n\nThis is unlikely to have affected the primary outcome but may have influenced secondary endpoints such as discharge decisions\n\n\nChildren with chronic medical conditions were excluded from the study, as were children who were breastfed\nChildren requiring an urgent transfusion prior to randomisation were not included in the study\nIt is unclear how closely management in the study population represents usual care, particularly in view of the lower than expected mortality\nThe median time to transfusion of 1.2 hours may have been faster than usual care, particularly in the children who were less severely ill, as this group had been randomised to the immediate-intervention arm as part of the factorial study design\nStudy results have limited external validity to the developed world setting\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA blood volume one-third higher than the WHO recommendation did not result in lower 28-day mortality in sub-Saharan African children hospitalised with anaemia, so a change from current practice cannot be justified from this data\nThe interaction with temperature may be an interesting area for future research\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Original article] NEJM\n[editorial] NEJM Editorial\n[further reading] Appraisal by 2MinuteMedicine\n[further reading] TRACT Immediate vs Delayed\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Fraser Magee\nSummary date: 23rd August 2019\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
