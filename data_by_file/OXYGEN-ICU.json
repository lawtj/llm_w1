JAMA 2016; published on-line October 2016. doi:10.1001/jama.2016.11993\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill adults, does conservative oxygen therapy compared to liberal oxygen therapy reduce mortality?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nComputerised random number generator\nAllocation concealment maintained with use of sequentially numbered, closed, opaque envelopes\nNon-blinded\nSample size calculation: 660 patients required to detect and absolute difference in mortality of 6% from a baseline of 23%, with a false negative rate of 20% and a false positive rate of 5%\n\nStudy stopped after\u00a0unplanned interim analysis following earthquake that led to reduction in study hospital beds and low recruitment\n\n\nModified intention-to-treat analysis\n\nPatients excluded if withdrew consent (n=2), lack of data during ICU stay/did not receive at least 1 arterial blood gas analysis per day (n=9), ICU stay <72 hours (n=35)\n\n\nIntention-to-treat analysis also performed on all randomised patients\u00a0excluding those that withdrew consent\n\nSetting\n\nSingle medical-surgical ICU of University Hospital, Italy\nData collected March 2010 \u2013 October 2012\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nAged \u226518\nAdmitted to ICU with expected length of stay of \u226572 hours\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nPregnancy\nICU readmission\nDecision to withhold life sustaining treatment\nImmunosupression or neutropenia\nARDS with P/F ratio <150\nAcute decompensation of COPD\nEnrollment in another study\n\n\n480 patients randomised, of whom 434 analysed in modified intention-to-treat population\n\nIntervention\n\nConservative oxygen therapy: Target SpO2 94%-98% (n=236)\n\nLowest possible FiO2 to maintain PaO2 of 70-100mmHg\nDuring intubation, airway suction, and hospital transfer patients only received supplemental oxygen if SpO2 <94%\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard oxygen therapy: Target SpO2 97%-100% (n=244)\n\nFiO2 of at least 0.4, allowing PaO2 of up to 150mmHg\nPatients received FiO2 of 1.0 during intubation, airway suction, hospital transfer\n\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics in conservative vs. conventional group:\n\nAge (median): 63 vs. 65\nSurgical admission: 64% vs. 61%\nRespiratory failure: 56% vs. 59.%\nMechanical ventilation: 66% vs. 68%\nShock: 31% vs. 33%\nLiver failure: 19% vs. 21%\nRenal failure: 15% vs. 16%\nInfection: 38% vs. 40%\nSimplified Acute Physiology Score II (median): 37 vs. 39\n\nComparing oxygen control in\u00a0conservative vs. control group (for modified intention to treat population):\n\n\u00a0Median FiO2 was significantly lower (p<0.001)\n\n\u00a00.36 (IQR 0.30-0.40) vs. 0.39 (IQR 0.35-0.42)\n\n\nMedian PaO2 was significantly lower (p<0.001)\n\n87mmHg (IQR 79-97) vs. 102mmHg (IQR 88-116)\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\u00a0ICU mortality \u2013 significantly lower in conservative oxygen group\n\n11.6% vs. 20.2% (Absolute risk reduction [ARR] 8.6%, 95% C.I. 1.7%-15%, p=0.01)\nNumber needed to treat 12\nFragility index 3 patients\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: comparing conservative vs. conventional group\n\nNew organ failure during ICU stay\n\nAny new organ failure: no significant difference\n\n19% vs. 25.7%, p=0.09\n\n\nRespiratory failure: no significant difference\n\n6.5% vs. 6.4%\n\n\nShock: significantly lower in conservative group\n\n3.7% vs. 10.6%, p=0.006\nFragility index 4 patients\n\n\nLiver failure: significantly lower in conservative group\n\n1.9% vs. 6.4%, p=0.02\nFragility index 1 patient\n\n\nRenal

vs. 33.9% (ARR 9.9%, 95% C.I. 1.3%-18.2%, p=0.03)\n\n\nMechanical ventilation free hours (median)\u00a0\u2013 significantly higher in conservative oxygen group\n\n72 vs. 48, p=0.02\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of intention-to-treat population yielded results similar to those of modified intention-to-treat population with regard to primary and secondary outcomes\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\u00a0For critically ill patients with an ICU length of stay of >72 hours, a conservative vs. a conventional protocol for oxygen therapy resulted in a lower ICU mortality\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised control trial\nReporting of intention-to-treat analysis as well as modified intention-to-treat analysis\nClear difference achieved between median PaO2\u00a0for conservative and conventional groups\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle centre\nNon-blinded\nUnplanned early termination of study \u2013 this is known to increase the likelihood of effect overestimation\nBaseline imbalances in study population, favouring the conservative oxygen therapy group\n\u00a0The results had a low fragility index, meaning that if the outcomes had been different for a few patients, then the results reported would have no longer been statistically significant\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis single centre under powered study found that for critically ill patients a conservative, compared with a conventional, oxygen strategy resulted in a dramatic mortality benefit. As the authors state, a further multi-centre study is needed to confirm these findings. I hope that future trials also investigate the use of permissive hypoxia, which this trial did not investigate. Whilst awaiting for these trials I will avoid hyperoxia.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of Conservative vs. Conventional Oxygen Therapy on Mortality Among Patients in an Intensive Care Unit\n[further reading]\u00a0Oxygen in the ICU: Too Much of a Good Thing?\n[further reading]\u00a0Conservative vs. Liberal Oxygenation Targets for Mechanically Ventilated Patients.
