NEJM 2023. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2212663\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with sepsis-induced hypotension does a restrictive fluid strategy (with early vasopressor usage) compared to a liberal fluid strategy result in lower mortality before discharge by day 90?\n\nBackground\n\nThe 2021 SSC Guidelines recommend the use of large volumes of fluid (30ml/kg) during the initial resuscitative phase of septic shock\n\nThis however is based on low quality evidence \u2013 with only a weak, low quality recommendation in the above guidelines\n\n\nPractice varies widely, with an Australian observational study showing a median of 4.2L of fluid given to septic patients within the first 24 hours\nThe recently published CLASSIC trial\u00a0showed no difference in 90-day mortality when comparing a restrictive fluid strategy to standard care; however randomisation for this trial occurred in ICU after initial fluid resuscitation\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, randomized, unblinded superiority trial\nPatients randomly assigned in 1:1 manner to restrictive or liberal strategies\nRandomised via central web based system\n\nStratified by trial site\n\n\nProtocol amended in October 2019\n\nLimited initial infusion to 1000ml if vitals signs stabilised and felt to be volume replete\n\n\nPre-specified stopping boundaries (for both futility or efficacy in either group) at 1/3 or 2/3rds recruitment\n\nStudy was stopped at the 2nd interim analysis due to futility, there were no concerns of harm from the DSMB\n\n\nInformed consent required from patients or legal representatives\nProtocol adherence monitored for first 300 patients and in 10% (random sample) during remainder of trial\nPower calculation:\n\nAssuming baseline mortality of 15% and an absolute difference of 4.5% in the restrictive group\n2320 patients needed to have 90% power at a significance level of 0.05\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n60 US centres\nMarch 2018 to January 2022\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdult patients with suspected / confirmed infection\nSepsis induced hypotension (SBP < 100 mmHg or MAP <65mmHg following > 1000ml IV fluid)\n\n\nExclusion:\n\n> 4 hours since meeting inclusion criteria for sepsis induced hypotension\n>24 hours since hospital presentation\n> 3L IVT (including pre-hospital)\nInability to obtain informed consent\nPregnancy\nFluid overload\nBlood pressure is at known or reported baseline level\nHypotension suspected to be from non-sepsis cause\nSevere volume depletion from non-sepsis causes\n\n\n12276 met inclusion criteria \u2192 4868 met eligibility criteria (i.e. no exclusion criteria) \u2192 1563 randomised\n\n782 restrictive group\n781 to liberal group\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of restrictive vs. liberal group\n\nGenerally well matched\n\nAge: 59.1 vs 59.9\nFemale: 47 vs 47%\nChronic heart failure: 13 vs 10%\nESRF with haemodialysis: 4 vs 5%\nSOFA score: 3.4 vs 3.5\nSBP: 93 vs 94 mmHg\nLactate: 2.9 vs 2.9\nMedian time from eligibility to randomisation: 61 vs 60 mins\nMedian volume of fluid administered before randomisation: 2050 mls vs 2050 mls\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nRestrictive Group\n\nIf SBP < 100mmHg or MAP < 65 mmHg after receipt of 1 \u2013 3L crystalloid:\n\nAll bolus and maintenance fluids ceased\nUp to 2L fluid boluses allowed (including pre-randomisation) at discretion of clinician\nFollowing this if, MAP < 65 mmHg or SBP < 90 mmHg\n\nTitration of norepinephrine +/- second vasopressor aiming MAP > 65\n\n\nOnce MAP in target then fluids limited to KVO, medications and nutrition\n\n\nRescue fluids recommended for (500ml bolus):\n\nSevere hypotension (SBP < 70, MAP < 50 mmHg)\nRefractory hypotension (SBP <90 or MAP <65 on Norepinephrine > 20 mcg min or equivalent)\nLactate > 4 mmol/L and increasing after 2 hours of therapy\nSinus HR > 130 for 15 mins\nEchocardiographic evidence or haemodynamic evidence of extreme hypovolaemia\nFelt to be in best interests by treating team\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nLiberal Group\nSBP < 100mmHg or MAP < 65 mmHg after receipt of 1 \u2013 3L crystalloid\n\nHalt all maintenance\nPrescribe 2L at randomisation (to be completed within 180 mins)\n\n2nd litre can be with-held if volume replete following clinical assessment following first litre\n\n\nIf any of the following present then further 500ml bolus:\n\nMAP < 65 or SBP < 90 mmHg\nLactate > 4 mmol/L and increasing\nUOP < 30mls/hr\nHR > 110 bpm (sinus)\nRequirement for vasopressors\nMeasured or clinical assessment\n\n\n\n\nRescue vasopressors allowed if severe hypotension (defined as per restrictive group), lactate > 4 mmol/L and increasing after 2 hours, > 5L total IV fluid given, clinical manifestations of fluid overload or treating team felt to be in best interests\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAssigned protocol followed for 24 hours\nHourly reassessments or after any intervention\nProtocol could be over-ridden at any time if felt to be in best interests of patient\nVasopressors could be administered peripherally\n\n40% in restrictive group and ~25% in liberal group had peripheral vasopressor infusion\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nDeath before discharge home by day 90: 14.0% in restrictive group vs 14.9% in liberal group\n\nEstimated difference -0.9% (95% CI -4.4 to 2.6), p = 0.61\n\n\n\n\nEfficacy and Safety outcomes:\n\nNo significant difference in\n\ndays free from organ support therapy by day 28:\ndays free from ventilator use at 28 days\ndays out of ICU from day 1 to 28\nnew intubation with mechanical ventilation by day 28\nARDS onset between day 1 and day 7\nSerious Adverse Events:\n\n3 vs 0 counts of extravasation of vasopressors in restrictive group (all managed conservatively)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubgroup Analysis:\n\nNo subgroup favoured with liberal or restrictive fluid use\n\nThese included: age, sex, race, location at randomisation, pneumonia, baseline SBP < 90 or vasopressor use\n\n\n\n\nPost-hoc Analysis:\n\nHigher rates of ICU admission in restrictive group (Table S8):\n\n0 \u2013 24 hours: 67 vs 59%\n0 \u2013 7 days: 70% vs 62%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nA restrictive fluid strategy (with earlier vasopressor use) did not result in significantly lower (or higher) \u00a0mortality before discharge home by day 90 than a liberal fluid strategy\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised\nMulti-centre trial with broad inclusion criteria means results applicable to ED and early ICU practice where patients present in undifferentiated manner\n\nThe caveat to this is that sepsis is a heterogenous process and different causes of sepsis may respond differently to fluid\n\n\nExcellent design with high internal validity that helps answer an important and frequently occurring question with prior limited evidence base\nHigh level of adherence to protocol\n\n97% adherence in restrictive group and 96% in liberal group (within audited sample)\nThis is impressive given time constraints on ED management\n\n\nAchieved separation in fluid administered in first 24 hours\nAlmost identical amounts of fluid administered in both groups following the intervention to day 7 (Table S3)\nExcellent safety outcome reporting including on peripheral vasopressor administration\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnblinded\nSingle country may limit external validity\nEarly cessation\nLarge numbers eligible but not enrolled (n = 3303, ~25% of all those screened) \u2013 this may introduce a selection bias. This includes:\n\n900 as study team unable to obtain informed consent\n887 patient or surrogate refused consent\n873 MD refusal\n346 not excluded but not enrolled\n\n\nPatients may not have been that unwell at baseline (median SBP > 90, low lactate levels, an ICU admission rate of ~63% and only ~60% patients in restrictive group required vasopressors)\nNo dynamic methods used to assess fluid responsiveness\nThe fluid regimes don\u2019t account for patient weight / size \u2013 2L in a 50kg patient is likely to have a different physiological response to that in a 120kg patient\nSignificant amounts of the study were left to individual clinician preference, introducing bias\nThis trial compares to protocolised approaches \u2013 other approaches may have different outcomes\n\nARISE-FLUIDS\u00a0and ANDROMEDA-SHOCK 2 will add more information\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial dovetails with the CLASSIC trial with respect to the time course of fluid restriction in critically ill septic patients\nThis paper will not change my current practice. It appears both approaches are safe and therefore I will continue to use a multi-modal approach to assess my patients and their requirement for fluid and make the decision to prescribe further fluid or commence vasopressors based on this assessment and prior response to fluid already administered\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Early Restrictive or Liberal Fluid Management for Sepsis-Induced Hypotension\nFurther reading CLASSIC trial\u00a0\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker @hgmwalker89\nSummary date: 22nd January 2023\nPeer-review editor: Segun Olusanya\nPicture by: Pixabay\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
