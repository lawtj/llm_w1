While this reflects \u201creal world\u201d practice, it does reduce the internal and external validity of the trial data.\nAdding a co-primary outcome measure just before the trial ended. While this did not affect the actual recorded primary outcome, the trial was not designed to examine this variable.\nDespite trial conditions, a significant number of protocol violations were observed \u2013 34 patients (45%) in the restrictive group, and 23 patients (30%) in the control group. This considerably reduces the impact of the intervention. Most notably:\n\n27 patients (36%) in the intervention groups received fluid boluses outside indication\n16 restrictive patients (21%) and 18 control patients (24%) received colloids.\n\n\nThere was no significant difference in total fluid given to both groups of patients either during the first 5 days or overall during their ICU stay. The 1L deficit in resuscitation fluid seems to have been corrected for elsewhere (NG feeding and fluids with medication). The restrictive group may not have been truly restricted after all.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial demonstrated the feasibility of a fluid restrictive strategy post initial resuscitation of patients with septic shock.\nHowever, a truly restrictive strategy seems difficult to implement without protocol violations, and total fluid volumes were actually no different between the groups. In this trial this makes safety of this approach difficult to truly gauge.\n\u00a0A strategy of limiting any post-resuscitation fluid to patients who are either fluid responsive or tolerant, using dynamic indices of fluid responsiveness, seems to be supported by this trial, and by other available data from the FEAST and FACTT trials. This will remain my current strategy.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Restricting volumes of resuscitation fluids in adult with septic shock after initial management: the CLASSIC randomised, parallel-group multi centre feasibility trial\n[further reading] Acheampong A, Vincent JL.
