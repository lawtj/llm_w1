World J Surgery 2020; 44:1844-1853. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-020-05391-8\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with severe traumatic brain injury, does the administration of Beta-Blockade, compared with standard care alone, improve in-hospital mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nThe main aim of neurocritical in the management of traumatic brain injury is to mitigate the burden of secondary brain injury. The brain trauma foundation guidelines advocate augmenting blood pressure to maintain cerebral perfusion in the context of raised intracranial pressure whilst the Lund protocol aims to reduce cerebral hydrostatic pressure to avoid cerebral oedema\nSevere traumatic brain injury is the predominant cause of death and disability after trauma, and any potentially effective treatments to reduce mortality and disability should be explored\nMultiple observational cohort studies and retrospective matched case control studies have indicated that B-blockade is associated with a survival benefit and reduction in disability after severe traumatic brain injury. It is hypothesised that the benefit is caused by a reduction in the adrenergic effects of the initial insult thereby reducing secondary vasoconstriction and ischaemia\n\nDesign\n\nProspective Single Centre Randomised Controlled Trial\nUnblinded and no placebo in control arm as funding not available\nConsent sought from patients or next of kin\nPower calculation showed that 210 patients were needed to detect a 65% relative risk reduction with a significance level of 5% assuming a event rate of 20% in the control group\nRandomised by random number generator at 24 hours\nPatients with an isolated severe head injury (as opposed to poly-trauma) were determined as a specified sub-group for analysis\nAssociation between B-blocker therapy and in hospital survival, GOS-E at discharge and 6 months was evaluated using Poisson regression models\nRegistered at Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials\nModified intention to treat analysis (excluded patients who received b-blocker and developed bradycardia (n=3) or hypotension, or refused to continue treatment\n\nSetting\n\nConducted in the neurosurgical intensive care in the Emtiaz Trauma Hospital in Shiraz, Iran\nPatients recruited between December 1 2017 until August 31 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nPatients over 18 years old with blunt head trauma and an intracranial injury with an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of 3-5 (evaluated by a neurosurgeon and radiologist within 24 hours of admission)\nAdmitted to neuro-intensive care unit (main NICU admission criteria are severe TBI detected on admission CT or GCS <12)\nHaemodynamically stable at 24 hours after admission (BP>100, not requiring vasopresor or blood transfusion, and allowed to start enteral feeding)\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nExtracranial injury requiring surgery within first 24 hours (laparotomy, sternotomy, pelvic packing, long bone fracture fixation, surgery for spinal cord injury)\nPatients already on B-blocker therapy\nPersistent shock (SBP<100mmHg, base deficit >4 or oliguria) at 24 hours after admission\nPatients transferred from another hospital\n\n\n356 patients were assessed for eligibility, and after exclusion or lack of consent 222 patients were randomised. 102 were allocated to intervention arm (3 lost to follow up, 3 treatment discontinued due to bradycardia). 120 were allocated to the control arm\nComparing baseline characteristics of beta-blocker vs. control group \u2013 no significant differences:\n\nMale: 87% vs. 86%\nAge: 37 vs. 39\nHypertension: 9% vs. 11%\nDiabetes: 4% vs. 7.5%\nGCS <=8: 33% vs. 41%\nHead AIS >=4: 63% vs. 66%\nISS >=16: 83% vs. 74%\nEpidural haemorrhage: 34% vs. 37%\nSubdural haemorrhage: 37% vs. 47%\nSubarachoid haemorrhage: 35% vs 38%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nB-blocker and routine care\n\nPropranolol 20mg orally 12 hourly by mouth or NG\n\nGiven for 10 days or until hospital discharge whichever was first\nObserved for at least 24 hours with continuous BP monitoring in ICU\nPatients with bradycardia (<50 bpm) or Hypotension (<100mmHg) were excluded from further analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nRoutine NICU care (not defined)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: In-hospital mortality \u2013 no significant difference (b-blocker vs. control group)\n\n8.1% (n=8) vs. 16.7% (n=20), p=0.058\nAfter adjustment for all clinical variables \u2013 no significant difference\n\nadjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) 0.6 (95% C.I. 0.3-1.2), p=0.2\n\n\nNo significant difference in survival to hospital discharge in primary study gro\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: comparing b-blocker vs. control group \u2013 no significant differences\n\nGood functional outcome (GOS-E >=5) at:\n\nDischarge:\n\n72.4% vs. 66.7%, p=0.36\nAfter adjustment for all clinical variables\n\nAdjusted IRR 1.0 (95% C.I. 0.9-1.2), p=0.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 months:\n\n86.5% vs. 77.5%, p=0.09\nAfter adjustment for all clinical variables\n\nAdjusted IRR 1.1 (95% C.I. 0.9-1.2), p=0.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-specified sub-group analysis: Isolated severe TBI (n=154), comparing b-blocker (n=68) vs. control group (n=86)\n\nIn-hospital mortality \u2013 significantly reduced in b-blocker group\n\n4.4% vs. 18.6%, p=0.012\nPoisson regression analysis: control group had significantly increased mortality rate\n\nAdjusted IRR 3.1 (95% C.I. 1.1-8.9), p=0.037\n\n\n\n\nGood functional outcome at:\n\nDischarge \u2013 no significant difference\n\n77.9% vs. 65.1%, p=0.08\n\n\n6 months \u2013 significantly reduced in b-blocker group\n\n92.3% vs. 79.1%, p=0.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe results of the trial show that the use of early oral propranolol in patients suffering isolated severe traumatic brain injury lead to improved survival and better functional outcome up to 6 months following injury. This provides support for the routine administration of beta-blocker therapy as part of a standardised neuro-intensive care protocol.\n\nStrengths\n\nPragmatic RCT\nImportant clinical question\nRelevant patient outcomes (mortality and morbidity short term and longer term)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle Centre RCT\nSmall patient numbers (especially in final sub group analysis)\nNot blinded/No placebo\nResults only statistically significant after examination of predetermined sub-group\nRoutine care not specified\nOther interventions used in severe TBI not recorded (osmotic therapy, thiopentone coma, hypothermia which may have differed between groups)\nPatients who experienced side effects from b-blockers were excluded from analysis. Authors report that all of these patients had good functional outcome at discharge\nStudy performed in Iran only. This limits external validity to other healthcare settings\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThere is increasing evidence that propranolol may improve patient centred outcomes in patients with isolated severe traumatic brain injury\nI will consider starting propranolol in all cardiovascular stable patients with isolated severe TBI, but I will wait for further larger studies or a prospective multi-centre RCT before using it for all patients, or as part of a standard TBI protocol\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Beta-Blocker Therapy in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Joel Swindin \u2013 @JSwindin\nSummary date: 31/8/2020\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\nPhoto by: Lisaleo at Morguefile.com\n\n\n"
