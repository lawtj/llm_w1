Chest 2017; Published first online. doi:10.1016/j.chest.2017.08.1163\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients undergoing intubation, does the use of a pre-intubation checklist compared to no checklist prevent oxygen desaturation or systolic hypotension?\n\nBackground\n\nComplications occur in up to one-third of critically ill patients undergoing airway intubation, with hypoxaemia and hypotension being the most common event\nOperator inexperience and inadequate preparation are associated with increased incidence of complications\nA checklist is a cheap intervention that can improve non-technical \u201chuman\u201d factors during times of stress and high-intensity mental activity\n\nDesign\n\n2 x 2 factorial design\n\nOther side of the study assessed the effect of the ramped position vs the sniffing position for intubation of the critically ill adults: CHECK-UP-position\n\n\nRandomised, multicentre pragmatic trial\nPatients randomised in a 1:1 ratio using a computer and permuted blocks\nData collected by an independent observer, with quality/accuracy assurance carried out on 11% of the cases\n248 patients required to power the study at 80% to detect a difference between the two groups in lowest recorded saturation of 5%\n\n5% chosen based on previous similar studies\nInitial power calculations required only 170 patients\n\nAfter assessment of the standard deviations (SD) of the primary outcome for the whole study population at 6 months, the SD was larger than anticipated so a new power calculation was performed\nGroup assignments remained concealed\n\n\n\n\nWith respect to the lowest systolic blood pressure (SBP), 260 patients gave a 76.4% power to detect a 10mmHG difference in SBP between groups\n\nSetting\n\nFive tertiary ICUs in the United States\n\nThree of which were part of the factorial design with CHECK-UP-position, whilst the other two only randomised for CHECK-UP-checklist\n\n\nJuly 2015 to July 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\u00a0Patients over the age of 18 undergoing endotracheal intubation by critical care fellows or pulmonary fellows or anaesthetic residents in the ICU\nExclusion:\n\nIf awake intubation planned\nIf intubation was so urgent that the clinician felt the randomisation envelope could not be obtained in time\nOr if the clinician felt a specific checklist was required based on clinical need\n\n\n318 patients eligible, 51 excluded, 267 randomised, 262 analysed\n\n5 were excluded after randomisation\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nPre-intubation checklist\n\nA printed checklist was read aloud by a team member with a verbal acknowledgement of each item by the person performing the intubation\nThe checklist contained 10 items focusing on the set up and non-technical skills\nIt did not dictate technique, medications or method for pre-oxygenation\nThe checklist had to be performed prior to the administration of the procedural medications\n\u00a0Operators could abort the checklist at any point if they thought the clinical situation required so\n\n\n\nChecklist used for CHECK-UP-checklist trial.
