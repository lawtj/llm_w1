Lancet Gastroenterology Hepatology 2019; published online 29 May 2019. doi:10.1016/S2468-1253(19)30090-1\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding, does early transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) compared to standard care increase transplant-free survival?\n\nBackground\n\nAcute variceal bleeding, associated with advanced liver cirrhosis, has a poor prognosis with 6-week mortality as high as 55%\nStandard care involves vasoactive drugs, prophylactic antibiotics, endoscopic therapies and organ support\nWhen standard care has failed, TIPS procedures can be performed to reduce porto-venous pressures at the cost of increased encephalopathy\nEarly TIPS have been advocated but previous trials have been criticised for excessive bias from poor methodology, inappropriate outcome measures or under-powered sample sizes\n\nDesign\n\nSingle-centre randomised, controlled trial\nWritten informed consent from all patients or their next of kin\nRandomised 2:1 ratio\n\nManuscript justifies this ratio by stating \u201con the basis of previous studies that showed early TIPS improved survival \u2026 and to encourage recruitment\u201d\nPerformed through web-tool with adequate concealment of random sequence\nDynamically balanced using Pocock and Simon\u2019s minimisation method, balanced for:\n\nChild Pugh class B vs C\nPresence or absence of active bleeding\n\n\n\n\nClinicians and patients were not blinded to allocation due to the nature of the intervention\n\nOutcome assessors and investigators remained unaware of group allocation\n\n\nTarget sample size was 120 assuming:\n\nPower 80% and alpha significance level 0.05\nBaseline survival in Standard Care group 60%\nAbsolute survival increase of 25% (i.e. survival in Early TIPS group of 85% \u2013 this would equate NNT 4)\nDrop-out rate 5%\n\n\nModified Intention-to-treat analysis after removing patients that were randomised but did not meet inclusion criteria\n\nSupplemented by per-protocol analysis\nPre-specified and post-hoc subgroup analyses performed\n\n\nPrimary analysis performed using probability curve estimates (Kaplan-Meier), which look at the estimated rate of events occurring over time (rather than a simple count of events that have occurred at a specific follow-up time)\n\nEach estimate is expressed as a Hazard Rate and the comparison of two Hazard Rates is expressed as the Hazard Ratio\nThis increases the power of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (a true positive conclusion) despite a smaller sample size\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre in tertiary university hospital in China\nJune 2011 to Sept 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adults between 18 and 75 years of age; liver cirrhosis; endoscopically proven acute variceal bleeding; Child-Pugh B or C\nExclusion: Uncontrolled bleeding prior to randomisation; bleeding from isolated gastric or ectopic varices; severe cardiopulmonary disease; spontaneous recurrent hepatic encephalopathy; complete portal vein thrombosis; creatinine greater than 3 mg/dL (265 umol/L); malignancy; uncontrolled infection or sepsis; previous shunt (TIPS or surgical procedure) or previous standard care (beta-blockade and variceal banding); contra-indications to TIPS; pregnancy; unable to give consent or declined consent\n373 screened; 132 randomised (TIPS = 86; Standard Care = 46)\n\n3 excluded after randomisation as did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria\n\n\nBaseline demographics were similar between groups (Early TIPS vs Standard Care)\n\nMean age: 50 vs 50 years\nGender: 63% vs 76% male\nCirrhosis aetiology:\n\nHep B Virus: 74% vs 76%\nHep C Virus: 4% vs 9%\nAlcohol: 2% vs 9%\nAutoimmune: 4% vs 2%\nPrimary biliary cholangitis: 5% vs 0%\nUnknown: 12% vs 4%\n\n\nMean MELD score: 14.0 vs 13.4\nMean Child-Pugh score: 8.0 vs 8.0\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nEarly TIPS\n\nTransjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt performed within 72 hours (preferably within 24 hours) of initial diagnostic endoscopy\nVasoactive drugs continued until TIPS performed\nProphylactic antibiotics given for 5\u20137 days from admission\nTIPS performed under conscious sedation and with local anaesthetic at the puncture site\n8 mm covered stent inserted and dilated to 8 mm\nIf portal hypertension recurred or ultrasound demonstrated shunt dysfunction, a TIPS revision with angioplasty or replacement stent was performed\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard Care\n\nVasoactive drugs continued from admission up to day 5\nPropranolol started on day 6 at 20 mg twice daily\n\nTitrated to reduce resting heart rate by 25% but not lower than 55 bpm\n\n\nPlanned endoscopic band ligation was performed within 7\u201314 days after initial diagnostic endoscopy\n\nRepeated approximately every 14 days until varices were gone\nMonitoring endoscopy was performed every six months\n\n\nTIPS were inserted if bleeding failed to be controlled or clinically significant bleeding occurred\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nInitial bleeding episode was controlled by vasoactive drugs and endoscopic therapy in both groups\n\nVasoactive drugs: octreotide, somatostatin, terlipressin\nEndoscopic therapy: banding, sclerotherapy\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: transplant-free survival was greater in the Early TIPS group\n\nSurvival estimates model\n\nHazard Ratio: 0.50 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.98; P = 0.04)\n\nThis means the average event rate (death or transplant) during follow-up was half in the Early TIPS group compared to the Standard Care group\nThe wide 95% CI means that the true effect probably lies somewhere between an event rate in the Early TIPS group of one-quarter that of the Standard Care group (clinically a very significant difference) or almost equal (no effect difference from Early TIPS)\n\n\nAbsolute Risk Difference: -16% (95% CI -31% to 0.04%)\nNumber Needed to Treat: 7\n\n\nIncidence of death or transplant by last follow-up :\n\nEarly TIPS group: 20%\nStandard Care group: 36%\nAbsolute Risk Reduction (ARR): 15.48% (95% CI -0.55% to 31.50%; P = 0.0529)\nFragility Index: 0\n\nThis time-point analysis has used Fishers\u2019 Exact test\nThis biostatistical method has a lower power of identifying a true positive result than the event-rate analysis used by the trial authors\nA Fragility Index of zero indicates that the conventional statistical significance threshold is not met by simply using an alternative biostatistical method, and illustrates that the strength of the conclusion from this trial is not very robust\n\n\n\n\nIncidence of liver transplant by last follow-up:\n\nEarly TIPS group: 2%\nStandard Care group: 2%\nHazard Ratio: 0.87 (95% CI 0.08 to 9.57; P = 0.91)\nAuthors postulate that Chinese policy and availability of organs for transplant reduced the incidence of transplant\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nFailure to control bleeding or re-bleeding occurred less in the Early TIPS group\nNew or worsening ascites occurred less in the Early TIPS group\nOvert hepatic encephalopathy was not different between groups\nOther complications and adverse events were not different between groups\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with advanced liver cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding, early TIPS is superior to standard care (vasoactive drugs and endoscopic therapy)\n\nStrengths\n\nImportant question in high-risk and high-occurrence population\nClearly postulated hypothesis and reasonable methodology to test this\nGood biostatistical methods using event-rate analysis rather than time-point analysis\nAdequate concealment of randomisation sequence\nBlinding of assessors and investigators\nGood period of follow-up (median two years)\nMeasured benefits and possible harm from intervention\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnclear why 2:1 ratio used\n\nIf there was the belief that early TIPS was best, then was there equipoise to ethically conduct the trial?\n\n\nImpossible to blind clinician and patient, possibly introducing bias that usually favours the intervention group\nThe result is Fragile\n\nThe null hypothesis is not rejected when a more conventional, albeit weaker, statistical analysis is performed\nThis indicates that this trial is probably under-powered, that the precision of the estimated effect size is poor (wide confidence interval) and the possibility of the result actually being a false positive is higher than would be ideal\n\n\nSingle-centre study from China reduces external validity (generalisability)\n\nThe authors note differences in porto-caval pressure gradients before and after TIPS compared to a similar European trial and suggest that ethnicity is relevant\n\n\nThe majority of patients had cirrhosis due to viral disease, with a minority due to alcohol consumption\n\nThis may not be representative of other populations (certainly not my local population!) and therefore the result may not be generalisable\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis well conducted trial demonstrated that early TIPS was associated with a reduction in death or transplant events, and the conclusion is probably correct\nThe limitations of this trial make the strength of the conclusion weak and impossible to generalise to non-Chinese populations (and probably to non-viral cirrhosis patients too)\nThe hypothesis should be tested again in a broader population with a greater sample size\nIn the meantime, I will engage with my hepatology / endoscopy team early to discuss ideal management including TIPS for each individual patient\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Early TIPS with covered stents versus standard treatment for acute variceal bleeding in patients with advanced cirrhosis\n[further reading]\u00a0Biostatistics Primer: What a Clinician Ought to Know: Hazard Ratios\n[further reading]\u00a0TIPS on LITFL\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Duncan Chambler\nSummary date: 17 July 2019\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\n\n\n"
