NEJM 2018; published online Jan 9, 2019.DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa1806311\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, does caplacizumab compared with placebo, \u00a0reduce the time to normalisation of the platelet count?\n\nBackground\n\nAcquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a thrombotic microangiopathy characterised by thrombocytopenia and haemolytic anaemia\nAutoantibodies inhibit activity of the von-Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS13 which leads to platelet consumption and microvascular thrombosis\nCaplacizumab, an immunoglobulin fragment, targets the A1 domain of von Willebrand factor, preventing interaction with the platelet glycoprotein receptor and the subsequent microvascular thrombosis\nThe phase II TITAN study demonstrated a significantly reduced time to normalisation of platelet count in patients treated with caplacizumab compared with placebo\n\nDesign\n\nDouble blind randomised controlled trial\nStratified according to baseline GCS\nFollowed up for 28 days post treatment period\nEfficacy analyses conducted in the intention to treat population\nSafety analyses conducted in per-protocol population (all patients who received at least 1 dose of caplacizumab or placebo)\nSample size calculation: 132 patient would give the trial\n\n80% power to detect a 40% reduction in the primary outcome, with a 5% significance level and a 10% dropout rate\n83% power to detect a 20% reduction in the first key secondary outcome with a 5% significance level\n\n\nIndustry sponsored\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\n\nSetting\n\n92 centres worldwide (Australia, USA, Europe)\nData collected November 2015 \u2013 April 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nTTP diagnosed on the basis of clinical presentation\n\nboth thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia with schistocytes seen on blood smear\n\n\nHad received 1 plasma exchange treatment\nAge >=18 years, and in some sites children aged 2-18 years were eligible\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nCongenital TTP\nSuspected thrombotic microangiopathy that was not associated with TTP, such as haemolytic uraemic syndrome\n\n\n145 patients randomised\n\n1 patient withdrew consent prior to receiving study medication\n36 patients who had received at least 1 dose of study drug discontinued trial regimen (13 in the intervention group and 23 in the placebo group). The most common reasons for discontinuation were adverse events, withdrawal of consent, physician decision\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. placebo groups:\n\nAge: 45 vs. 47\nRecurrent TTP: 33% vs. 53%, p<0.05\n\nconsistent with more severe disease in intervention group as initial TTP episodes tend to be more severe at presentation than recurrent episodes\n\n\nMedian platelet count: 24,000 vs. 25,000\nMedian LDH: 449 vs. 403 U/l\nMedian creatinine: 77 vs. 82 umol/l\nADAMTS13 activity <10%: 81% vs. 89%\nGCS <=12: 8% vs. 7%\nImmunosuppressive therapy\n\nGlucocorticoids: 96% vs. 97%\nRituximab: 39% vs. 48%\n\nStarted by trial day 3: 12% vs. 22%\n\n\nMycophenolate mofetil: 8% vs. 0%\nOther: 8% vs. 4%\n\n\nImmune globulin concentrate infusion: 6% vs. 0%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nCaplacizumab\n\n10mg IV loading dose before the start of the 1st plasma exchange post randomisation\nSubsequent 10mg doses given subcutaneously once daily until 30 days after last daily plasma exchange\nTreatment could be extended for maximum of further 28 days, dependent on risk factors for recurrence of TTP\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\nDosing schedule as per intervention group\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nStandard of care treatment for TTP\n\nDaily plasma exchange\n\n1-1.5 * plasma volume, until at least 2 days after normalisation of the platelet count\n\n\nGlucocorticoids\n\nPrednisone or prednisolone at a dose of >=1mg/kg/day during daily plasma-exchange period and continuing for 1st week after the end of the daily plasma exchange period. Subsequent tapering of steroids at physician discretion with aim of stopping completely within 30 days after last plasma exchange\n\n\nOther immunosuppressive therapy allowed in accordance with clinical practice at each site\nIf new decrease in the platelet count that necessitated the re-initiation of daily plasma exchange then patients switched to open-label caplacizumab\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Time from 1st administration of study drug to normalisation of platelet count (>150,000), with discontinuation of daily plasma exchange within 5 days thereafter \u2013 significantly reduced in the intervention group\n\nAt any given time point, patients in the intervention group were 1.55 times as likely to have a normalisation of the platelet count compared with placebo\nRate ratio 1.55; 95% C.I. 1.09-2.19, p=0.01\nTime to normalisation of platelet count:\n\n25th centile: 1.75 vs. 1.94 days\n50th centile: 2.69 vs. 2.88 days\n75th centile: 2.95 vs. 4.50 days\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\n1st key secondary outcome: composite of TTP related death, recurrence of TTP, or a major thromboembolic event during the double blind treatment period \u2013 significantly reduced in the intervention group\n\n12% vs. 49%, p<0.001\n\n\nTTP related death \u2013 no significant difference\n\n0% vs. 4%\n\n\nRecurrence of TTP \u2013 significantly reduced in the intervention group\n\nAt any time: 12% vs. 38%, p<0.001\nDuring double blind treatment protocol: 4% vs. 38%\nAll 6 patients who had a relapse after stopping caplacizumab had an ADAMTS13 activity level <10% when the caplacizumab was stopped\n\n\nMajor thromboembolic event \u2013 no significant difference\n\n8% vs. 8%\n\n\nRefractory disease \u2013 no significant difference\n\n0% vs. 3%, p=0.06\n\n\nIn the intervention group significantly reduced:\n\nNumber of days of plasma exchange\n\n5.8 vs. 9.4 days\n\n\nLength of ICU stay\n\n3.4 vs. 9.7 days\n\n\nLength of hospital stay\n\n9.9 vs. 14.4 days\n\n\n\n\nAll cause mortality \u2013 no significant difference\n\n1% vs. 4%\n\n\nSerious adverse events \u2013 significantly increased in the intervention group\n\nOverall: 32% vs. 16%\nBleeding: 11% vs. 1%, most commonly epistaxis\nCardiac disorders: 6% vs. 1%\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\u00a0In patients with TTP, calpacizumab was associated with faster normalisation of the platelet count, a lower incidence of the composite of TTP related death, recurrence of TTP or a thromboembolic event during the treatment period\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nMulti-centre, multi-national\nDouble blinded\nUse of matched placebo\nIntention to treat analysis performed\nStratification by GCS to ensure equal balance in both groups\nAppropriate statistical models used\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPrimary outcome is not patient orientated\nThe significant improvement in time to platelet count resolution was driven by differences seen in the 75th centile. There was no significant difference in the 25th and 50th centile groups\nThere was a large dropout rate, with 13 of those receiving the intervention, and 25 of those receiving placebo not completing treatment. It is possible that the twice-higher rate of dropout in the placebo group meant that these patients differed in some way from those in the intervention arm\n1st key secondary outcome is a composite outcome. This includes TTP related mortality rather than all cause mortality\nIndustry sponsored\nDifferences in baseline characteristics\nThe use of other immunosuppressive therapy was not standardized which may have led to differences in the rates of use between the two groups\nPatients were only followed-up for 28 days so long-term data on the safety of caplacizumab was not investigated\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with acquired TTP, the use of caplacizumab compared with placebo significantly reduced the time to normalisation of platelet count. The difference was driven predominately by changes at the 75th centile with no significant differences at the 25th and 50th centiles\n\u00a0The 1st key secondary outcome found that the composite of TTP related death, recurrence of TTP or major thromboembolic event was significantly reduced in the intervention group. This was predominantly due to a reduction in the recurrence rate of TTP. The duration of ICU and hospital stay as well as the number of cycles of plasma exchange were significantly reduced in the intervention group\nThe number of serious adverse events was significantly increased in the intervention group\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Caplacizumab Treatment for Acquired Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\n[further reading]\u00a0Safety of Caplacizumab for the Treatment of Patients with Acquired Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Dave Slessor\nSummary date: 20th January 2019\nPeer-review editor: Fraser Magee\n\n\n"
