However, there was still a difference of 1.5g/dl between the daily lowest Hb levels in the intervention and the control groups. The authors also performed a per-protocol analysis which found no difference in the primary outcome.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with septic shock and managed in an ICU setting, a transfusion threshold of 7g/dl compared with 9g/dl resulted in no difference in mortality or ischaemic events. This paper supports my current practice. Avoiding unnecessary blood transfusion removes the risk of infectious, immune and non-immune related complications as well as conserving this limited resource.\u00a0However, in this study 10% of patients, in the low threshold group, \u00a0received transfusions despite being above the treatment threshold, therefore there may be times when the threshold needs to be modified.\nPatients with acute\u00a0coronary syndromes were excluded from this trial. Further research is needed to assess the safety of lower haemoglobin thresholds for transfusion in these patients.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Abstract only]\u00a0[Lower versus Higher Hemoglobin Threshold for Transfusion in Septic Shock]\n[Further reading]\u00a0Summary of TRICC\u00a0\u2013 The Bottom Line\n[Further reading]\u00a0Summary of Transfusion Strategies for Acute Upper GI Bleeding\u00a0\u2013 The Bottom Line\n[Videocast]\u00a0ESICM Lars Holst Hot Topics Session\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date: 7th October 2014\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@stevemathieu75\n\n\n"
