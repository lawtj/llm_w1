NEJM May 21 2017. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1704154\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with refractory vasodilatory shock does the addition of angiotensin II improve blood pressure compared with standard vasopressor therapy?\n\nBackground\n\nATHOS-3 (Angiotensin II for the Treatment of High-Output Shock) was conducted in an attempt to assess a third class of vasopressor for vasodilatory shock\nIt is known that patients who have refractory shock have high mortality (50% 30 day all- cause mortality) and we currently only have catecholamines (such as noradrenaline) and vasopressin in the armamentarium to support blood pressure\nAT II activates AT1a and AT1b receptors to increase intracellular Calcium in smooth muscle and activate the myosin contractile mechanism, thus promoting vasoconstriction. Exogenous administration of AT II augments the endogenous renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n1:1 assignment\nBlock randomisation\nAllocation concealment through a central Web-based system\nStratification according to MAP (<65mmHg or >65mmHg) and APACHE II score\u00a0(<30, 31-40 or >40)\nBlinded:\u00a0staff and patients\nInfusions of angiotensin II and placebo were in identical bags\n\nSetting\n\n75 Intensive Care Units across 9 countries (North America, Australasia, Europe)\nTrial conducted May 2015 \u2013 January 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n>18 years\nRequire a total sum catecholamine dose of >0.2mcg/kg/min for a minimum of 6 hours and a maximum of 48 hours to\u00a0maintain a MAP 55-70mmHg\nClinical features consistent with high-output shock (1 of ScvO2 >70% and CVP >8mmHg OR CI >2.3 L/min/BSA)\nPatient had urinary catheter, CVC and A-line in situ\nReceived at least 25 ml/kg of crystalloid or colloid over previous 24 hours\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nBurns > TBSA 20%\nAcute coronary syndrome\nBronchospasm\nLiver Failure\nMesenteric Ischemia\nActive bleeding\nAAA\nNeutrophil count < 1000 cm3\nVA ECMO\nHigh dose glucocorticoids\n\n\nParticipant numbers:\n\n404 eligible, 344 randomised (172 placebo, 172 angiotensin II)\n158 received placebo (13 withdrawn, 1 re-randomised to angiotensin II\u00a0) and 163 received angiotensin II (10 withdrawn) and were analysed by a modified intention to treat analysis\n\n\nComparison of baseline demographics;(ATII vs Placebo)\n\nAge: 63 vs 65 years\nMen; 56.2% vs 65.2%\nAPACHE II;\u00a0 27 vs 29\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nPatients on high dose vasopressors were commenced on 20ng/kg/min\u00a0of\u00a0ATII. The dose was adjusted over the first 3 hours to increase the MAP to at least 75mmHg. During the adjustment period the dose of vasopresors was held constant and could not be increased except for safety reasons. If the dose was increased the patient was deemed as not having had a response to the study intervention. The maximum rate of administration of the study medication during the first 3 hours was equivalent to a dose of 200ng/kg/min\nBetween 3-48 hours the dose of angiotensin II or placebo could be adjusted to a dose of 1.25-40ng/kg/min\n\nControl\n\nPatients on high dose vasopressors were commenced on placebo. The \u2018dose\u2019 of placebo was up-titrated over the next 3 hours. If the dose of the background vasopressors increased then the patient was deemed as a non-responder\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nAt\u00a0 hour 3,\u00a0the number of patients in whom\u00a0MAP increased to 75mmHg OR 10mmHg higher than baseline, without an increase in baseline vasopressors, was higher in the ATII group\n\n69.9% vs 23.4%\nOR 7.95; 95% CI 4.76-13.3; P < 0.001\nFragility Index: 57\nMean doses of background vasopressors were consistently less in the ATII group\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nCardiovascular component of the SOFA score at 48 was improved in ATII group:\u00a0-1.75 vs -1.28, P=0.01\nTotal SOFA score at 48 hours:\u00a0No difference\nAll-cause mortality was lower (not statistically significant) at day 7 in the ATII group:\n\n47/163 (28.8%) vs 55/158 (34.8%)\nHR 0.78 95% CI 0.53- 1.16, P=0.22\n\n\nAll-cause mortality was lower (not statistically significant) at day 28 in the ATII group:\n\n75/163 (46%) vs85/158 (53.8%)\nHR 0.78; 95% CI 0.57-1.07, P=0.12\n\n\nAdverse Events (ATII vs Placebo)\n\nSerious adverse events (60.7% vs 67.1%)\nAdverse event-related drug discontinuation (14.1% vs 21.5%)\nAll adverse events (87.1% vs 91.8%)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAngiotensin II effectively increased blood pressure in patients with vasodilatory shock that did not respond to high doses of conventional vasopressors\n\nStrengths\n\nStrong internal validity: allocation concealment, baseline balance, modified intention to treat analysis, block stratified randomisation, blinding, complete follow-up (for primary outcome measure)\nMulti-centre improves the external validity\nThe drug was tested in a patient group that had already trialed conventional therapy, so this was a particularly sick cohort of patients\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPrimary outcome measure was not clinically meaningful\nThe trial was not powered to detect mortality differences and did not measure other key ICU outcomes such as ICU length of stay, need for renal replacement therapy\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAngiotensin II increases blood pressure in patients with vasodilatory shock\nNumerically patients were less likely to have adverse events and die compared with the control group\nThis trial is likely to make angiotensin II available (the trial was conducted in consultation with the FDA)\nAngiotensin II is coming to an ICU near you\nFuture trials assessing clinically meaningful outcomes are needed to assess it\u2019s exact\u00a0role in this patient group\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Article]\u00a0Angiotensin II for the Treatment of Vasodilatory Shock\n[Further reading]\u00a0Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines\n[Further reading]\u00a0Podcast: Finfer on Sepsis.
