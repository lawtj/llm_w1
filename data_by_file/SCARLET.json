doi:10.1001/jama.2019.5358\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy does the administration of human recombinant thrombomodulin (rhsTM) compared to placebo reduce 28 day mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nThe presence of a sepsis-associated coagulopathy and its severity has been independently associated with an increased hospital mortality\nHaematological manipulation in patients with septic shock is a controversial area following the PROWESS and PROWESS-SHOCK trials involving Activated Protein C (Drotrecogin Alfa)\nART123 is a rhsTM, and acts as co-factor with thrombin in the activation of Protein C\nA Phase 2b study had shown the use of rhsTM to be safe, and there was a suggestion of efficacy (although this was not statistically proven) when 28 day mortality was analysed\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, double-blind, placebo controlled phase III trial\n\nRandomisation stratified by site with a block size of 4\nAllocation in a 1:1 ratio\n\n\nConsent sought prospectively\nAll potential patients discussed with a physician from one of the 2 regional coordinating \u00a0centres to confirm the inclusion criteria (listed below)\nWindow 1 (24 hours) commenced when a patient with suspected or confirmed bacterial infection developed either organ dysfunction or coagulopathy\nWindow 2 (12 hours) commenced from when the other inclusion criteria of organ dysfunction is met and allowed for discussion with coordinating centres, consent and randomisation\n\nWindow length changed from 15 hours to 40 hours from first qualifying measure during the study to enable more time for participant identification and enrolment\n\n\nStudy supported by Asahi-Kasei Pharma America Corporation (involved in design, collection, management, and analysis)\n\nSetting\n\n319 sites in 27 countries\nPatients enrolled from October 2012 \u2013 March 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n> 18 years old and\nclinical objective evidence of bacterial infection with a known site of infection (from clinical, microbiological and radiological evidence) and SIRS response (WBC count and temperature) and\n\nWBC < 4000/mm\u00b3 or > 12000/mm\u00b3\nTemperature < 36\u00baC or > 38\u00baC\n\n\nconcurrent cardiovascular and/or respiratory dysfunction and\n\nvasopressors to maintain MAP > 65 mmHg following adequate fluid resuscitation\nmechanical ventilation and P/F ratio < 250 (or < 200 if respiratory infection)\n\n\ncoagulopathy\n\nINR > 1,4 (not explained by another known aetiology)\nPlatelets 30 \u2013 150 x 109\n\n\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nMultiple, but important ones include:\n\nPlatelets < 30 x 109\nUse of anticoagulants / antiplatelets in three days prior to receiving study drug (except DVT prophylaxis, aspirin < 325mg per day, heparin locks, and anticoagulation for RRT)\nRecent CVA, trauma with increased risk of bleeding (< 3 months), GI Bleed (6 weeks, unless corrective interventional procedure), completion of surgery that may be haemorrhagic within prior 12 hours of study drug, bleeding diathesis or hereditary hypercoagulable state\nRenal dysfunction (chronic necessitating RRT, or acute with oliguria > 48 hours to receiving study drug\n\n\n\n\nSample size of 800 calculated to provide 80% power at a 5% 2 level \u03b1 level based on an ARR of 8% (24% placebo and 16% rhsTM)\n\n405 allocated to placebo and 395 rhsTM\n\n\nWell balanced baseline characteristics of both control and rhsTM groups with regards to demographics, coagulation, illness severity, organ dysfunction, and site of infection\n\nIntervention\n\nART-123 \u2013 a recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin\n\n0.06mg/kg/d (max 6mg/day) for 6 consecutive days\ngiven as IV bolus or diluted in 50mls 0.9% saline for 15 minute infusion\nmust be administered within 4 hours from closure of window 2\n\n\n\nControl\n\nMatching placebo\n\nsupplied in identically labelled, individual glass ampoules containing the same volume (1ml)\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nOther treatment guided as per clinical state, no specified similarities in treatment\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\n28 Day Mortality\n\n26.8% rhsTM vs 29.4% placebo\nARR 2.55% (95% CI -3.68% to 8.77%)\n\n\n\n\nSubgroup Analyses\n\nPre-specified\n\nNon significant mortality difference in those with higher severity score (APACHE II > 25) or concomitant heparin use\nNo other pre-specified or post-hoc subgroup significant with respect to 28 day mortality\nIn those with a baseline INR > 1.4 the Kaplan-Meier Plot does show a suggestion of reduced mortality\n\nThe ARR is 4.01% (-3.04 to 11.06%) compared to an ARI of 5.45% for those with a baseline INR < 1.4 (-6.68% to 17.59%)\n\n\n\n\nCoagulation Markers\n\nAt day 6 the plasma D-dimer concentration, Prothrombin fragment F1.2 (a marker of thrombosis) and thrombin-antithrombin complex levels were lower\nIn a post-hoc analyses the change from baseline of these markers was statistically significantly greater (p < 0.5) in the rhsTM group\n\n\n\n\nSafety Outcome:\n\nAdverse Event Rate at day 28 (including major bleeding this includes life threatening, resulting in serious morbidity or \u00a0>6 units\u00a0packed red blood cells over 2 days)\n\nSerious Adverse Events 52% rhsTM vs. 50% placebo\nSerious Major Bleeding 5.8% rhsTM vs 4% placebo\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe administration of rhsTM to patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy did not significantly reduce 28 day mortality\n\nStrengths\n\nGiven the mortality trend and safety profile shown in the phase 2b study any study that tries to improve sepsis mortality is worthwhile\nMulti-centre, international, randomised and double-blind with similar baseline characteristics increase external validity\n\nHowever, 55/159 sites enrolled only one patient\n\n\nSensible inclusion of need for vasopressors and/or mechanical ventilation as a selection criteria\nThe collection of coagulation markers and the findings are interesting however I am not sure what clinical outcome this reduction in markers would translate to?\nWell reported safety outcomes important (reported in supplementary material) to allow clinicians\nDesign minimises bias:\n\nSelection bias minimised by need to discuss with coordinating centres\nPerformance and Detection bias minimised by strict blinding protocols\nAttrition bias low (16 patients randomised but not included)\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDecision to extend time window for treatment meant that ~ 20% of study population no longer had a coagulopathy by time of drug administration\nSample calculations based on 8% difference, previous Phase 2b study had only shown a difference of 3.8% (17.8% in rhsTM group vs 21.56% in placebo)\nAs with any sepsis trial the population is heterogenous\nSome of the reported outcomes (including the subgroup analysis of INR <1.4 or > 1.4 and reduction from baseline in coagulation markers) were post-hoc analyses (the author\u2019s quite rightly highlight the need to interpret these with caution)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBased on this study I will not be advocating for the use of rhsTM in patients with a septic coagulopathy\nThe continued research into improving outcomes of this cohort of patients should be continued given its independent association with hospital mortality\n\nExternal
