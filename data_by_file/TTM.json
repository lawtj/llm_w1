NEMJ 2013;369:2197-206\nClinical Question\n\n\nIn adults that suffer an out-of-hospitals (OOH) cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause, does induced therapeutic hypothermia targeting 36\u00b0C compared to 33\u00b0C reduce mortality or reduce neurological deficit?\n\n\nDesign\n\n\nRandomised, controlled clinical trial\nSingle blinded\n\n\nSetting\n\n\n36 intensive care units\nEurope and Australia\nNovember 2010 and January 2013\n\n\nPopulation\n\n\nInclusion: adult patients who were unconscious (GCS < 8) on admission to hospital after OOH cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause.\nExclusion: > 6 hours from ROSC to enrolment screening, unwitnessed arrest with systole, hypothermia < 30\u00b0C, suspected or known intracranial haemorrhage.\n950 patients enrolled\n\n\nIntervention\n\n\n28 hours of temperature management with a target of 36\u00b0C using invasive or surface cooling, followed by gradual warming to 37\u00b0C at 0.5\u00b0C per hour and avoidance of pyrexia for 72 hours from randomisation.\n\n4 patients did not receive this intervention as assigned\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\n\n28 hours of temperature management with a target of 33\u00b0C using invasive or surface cooling, followed by gradual warming to 37\u00b0C at 0.5\u00b0C per hour and avoidance of pyrexia for 72 hours from randomisation\n\n3 patients did not receive this control as assigned\n\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\n\nPrimary outcome: There was no difference in all-cause mortality through to the end of the trial (mean follow-up period was 256 days).\n\n48% had died in the 36\u00b0C group and 50% had died in the 33\u00b0C group.\nThe hazard ratio for death was 1.06 for cooling to 33\u00b0C (CI 0.89 to 1.28; p=0.51)\n\n\nSecondary outcome: There were no differences between the groups regarding their neurological status (modified Rankin scale or Cerebral Performance Category).\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\nThis trial does not provide evidence that targeting a body temperature of 33\u00b0C confers any benefit for unconscious patients admitted to the hospital after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, as compared with targeting a body temperature of 36\u00b0C.\n\n\nStrengths\n\nHighly relevant clinical question\nWell designed, pragmatic methodology\nObjective outcomes assessed by blinded external physicians\nIntention-to-treat analysis with minimal drop-out / loss-to-follow-up\n\nWeaknesses\n\n\nNot generalisable to arrests with long or unknown \u2018down-time\u2019\n\nUnwitnessed arrests with systole as initial rhythm were excluded\n90% had bystander witness; 73% had bystander CPR\nMedian time to basic life support was 1 minute!\nMedian time to advanced life support was 9 and 10 minutes\nMedian time to ROSC was 25 minutes\n\n\nFollow-up was relatively short-term; unclear if 36\u00b0C confers long-term neurological benefit or harm.\nWide confidence intervals: with 95% certainty, true hazard ratio for 33\u00b0C could be anywhere between 0.89 (strong benefit) and 1.28 (strong harm).\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\nThis trial has not shown any benefit of therapeutic hypothermia at 33\u00b0C over 36\u00b0C after OOH cardiac arrest. Not everyone agrees this is the same as \u201c36\u00b0C is equivalent to 33\u00b0C\u201d.\nMy conclusion: if cooling a patient to the conventional 33\u00b0C induces unwanted effects, aim for 36\u00b0C instead and it probably will make no difference to the patient\u2019s outcome.\n\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf not available without subscription / abstract\u00a0/ doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1310519\nEditorial or Commentaries\nSo many to choose!\n\n\nSimon Carley at St Emlyn\u2019s Blog: JC: What\u2019s the target temperature for OOHCA cooling.
