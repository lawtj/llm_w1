DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1912388\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients post myocardial infarction, does low dose colchicine compared with placebo, reduce ischaemic cardiovascular events?\n\nBackground\n\nEvidence supports the role of inflammation in atherosclerosis and its complications\nThe CANTOS study reported that the monoclonal antibody canakinumab, that inhibits interleukin-1b, decreased cardiovascular events but also increased fatal infections\nColchicine is an anti-inflammatory that is used to treat gout & pericarditis. It is hypothesised that this may reduce the risk of atherosclerotic events in patients with coronary artery disease\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n\n1:1 ratio\n\n\nDouble blinded, placebo-controlled\nBlinded assessment of outcomes\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\nSample size calculation: 4500 patients would give 80% power with a false positive rate of 5% assuming a 27% lower relative risk of the primary outcome with colchicine, based on an assumed event rate in the placebo group of 7%\n\nSetting\n\n167 centres in 12 countries (predominately Canada, South America & Europe)\nTrial enrolment December 2015 \u2013 August 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nAdult patients who had had a myocardial infarction within the last 30 days\nHad completed any planned percutaneous revascularisation procedures\nWere treated according to national guidelines that included the intensive use of statins\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nSevere heart failure, ejection fraction <35%\nStroke within previous 3 months\nType 2 MI\nCABG within previous 3 years or planned\nHistory of non-cutaneous cancer within the previous 3 years\nInflammatory bowel disease or chronic diarrhoea\nNeuromuscular disease, severe renal or hepatic disease, drug or alcohol abuse, long term steroid use\n\n\n4745 patients randomised\n\nFor 23 patients (0.5%) vital status not available\n89 (1.9%) patients lost to follow up\n30 patients (0.6%) withdrew consent\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nAge: 60.6 vs. 60.5 years\nFemale sex: 19.9% vs. 18.4%\nWhite race: 73% vs. 72%\nTime from index MI to randomisation: 13.4 vs. 13.5 days\nPCI for index MI: 92.7% vs. 93.3%\nMedication use\n\nAspirin: 98.6% vs. 98.9%\nOther anti-platelet agent: 97.6% vs. 98.2%\nStatin: 98.9% vs. 99.1%\nBeta-blocker: 89.4% vs. 88.3%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nLow dose colchicine\n\n0.5mg once daily\nMedian duration of trial drug: 19.6 months\nAt the end of the trial, the trial regimen had been discontinued in 18.4% of patients with a median duration of 7.1 months\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\nMedian duration of trial drug was 19.5 months\nAt the end of the trial, the trial regimen had been discontinued in 18.7% of patients with a median duration of 6.1 months\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nTreated according to national guidelines that included the intensive use of statins\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Composite of death from cardiovascular causes, resuscitated cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, stroke or urgent hospitalisation for angina leading to coronary revascularisation \u2013 significantly reduced in colchicine group\n\n5.5% vs. 7.1% (Hazard ratio 0.77; 95% C.I. 0.61-0.96, p=0.02)\nNNT 63\nFragility index 5 patients\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: \u2013 comparing intervention vs. control group\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nDeath from cardiovascular causes \u2013 no significant difference\n\n0.8% vs. 1%\nHR 0.84; 95% C.I. 0.25-2.73\n\n\nResuscitated cardiac arrest\n\n0.2% vs. 0.3%\nHR 0.83; 95% C.I. 0.25-2.73\n\n\nMyocardial infarction\n\n3.8% vs. 4.1%\nHR 0.91; 95% C.I. 0.68-1.21\n\n\nDeath\n\n1.8% vs. 1.8%\nHR 0.98; 95% C.I. 0.64-1.49\n\n\n\n\nSignificantly reduced in colchicine group\n\nStroke\n\n0.2% vs. 0.8%\nHR 0.26, 95% C.I. 0.1-0.7\nNNT 171\nFragility index 3\n\n\nUrgent hospitalisation for angina leading to coronary revascularisation\n\n1.1% vs. 2.1%\nHR 0.5, 95% C.I. 0.31-0.81\nNNT 96\nFragility index 7\n\n\n\n\nSide effects\n\nAny related adverse event \u2013 no significant difference\n\n16% vs. 15.8%, p=0.89\n\n\nDiarrhoea \u2013 no significant difference\n\n9.7% vs. 8.9%, p=0.35\n\n\nPneumonia \u2013 significantly increased in colchicine group\n\n0.9% vs. 0.4%, p=0.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with a recent myocardial infarction, low dose colchicine significantly reduced ischaemic cardiovascular complications\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nBlinding of outcome assessors\nMulti-centre, multi-national\nFollowed standardised guideline\n\nWeaknesses\n\nComposite outcome\nPrimary outcome had a fragility index that was less that the number of patients whose vital status was unknown\nDuration of follow-up was relatively short at ~23 months\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients following myocardial infarction, the use of colchicine compared with placebo, started at a median of 13 days post-infarct, significantly reduced the composite outcome of ischaemic cardiovascular events\nThis was primarily due to a reduction in the number of patients who had a stroke and the number of patients that had an urgent hospitalisation for angina leading to coronary revascularisation. There was no change in mortality\nDue to the low fragility index there should be some caution with the interpretation of these results\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Efficacy and Safety of Low-Dose Colchicine after Myocardial Infarction\n[further reading]\u00a0Trial presentation by primary author\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: David Slessor\nSummary date: 21st November 2019\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
