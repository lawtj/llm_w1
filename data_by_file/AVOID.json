DOI: 10.1161/circulationaha.114.014494\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with ST-elevation-myocardial infarction (STEMI), without hypoxia, does receiving supplemental oxygen compared with no supplemental oxygen reduce early myocardial injury?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled clinical trial\nComputer-generated randomisation sequence\nSealed opaque envelopes ensured allocation concealment\nBlock randomisation; size/variability unclear\nSingle blinded: clinicians and patients were aware. Outcome assessors and statisticians were blinded\n326 patients required to power the study at 90% to detect a 20% reduction in myocardial injury as assessed by peak cardiac troponin (cTnI) level and a probability of a type 1 error of 0.01.The sample size was increased to allow for an inaccurate prehospital diagnosis of STEMI. The final recruitment target was 600 prehospital randomisations, with 490 meeting inclusion criteria on arrival to hospital\n\nSetting\n\nPre-hospital Ambulance Victoria and 9 metropolitan hospitals with 24-hour PCI in Melbourne, Australia\nOctober 2011 to July 2014\nInclusion: adult patients with acute STEMI\n\nage >18\nchest pain <12 hours\nprehospital ECG evidence of STEMI, as determined by the paramedic, defined at ST-segment elevation of >0.1mV in 2 contiguous limb leads, or >0.2mV in 2 contiguous chest leads, or new LBBB pattern\n\n\nExclusion:\u00a0SaO2\u00a0< 94%, bronchospasm requiring nebulised salbutamol with oxygen, altered\u00a0conscious state or planned transport to a nonparticipating hospital\n638 patients were screened and randomised. 470 patients (74%) were subsequently included in analysis. All had emergent angiography\n\n50 patients excluded due to pre-hospital protocol violation\n118 excluded after physician assessment suggested an alternative diagnosis to STEMI\n\n\nBaseline characteristics similar: age; male preponderance; risk factors for cardiovascular disease; pain scores; physiology; and times to hospital arrival and medical intervention\n\nIntervention\n\nOxygen group\nPatients received supplementary oxygen via face mask at 8L/min administered by the paramedics and continued until transfer from the cardiac catheter lab to the cardiac ward.\n\n1 patient did not receive oxygen in this group\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNo oxygen group\nPatients did not receive oxygen unless\u00a0SaO2<94% in which case they received oxygen via nasal prongs (4L/min) or\u00a0a mask (8L/min) to achieve\u00a0SaO2>94%\n\n17 patients required oxygen\n\n\n\nIn both groups\n\nAll patients received aspirin 300mg orally by paramedics. Additional antiplatelet therapy and choice of anticoagulation and PCI strategy were at the discretion of the treating interventional cardiologist.\nTime to PCI was similar between the 2 groups (150.5 minutes in oxygen group vs 162 minutes in no oxygen group p =0.09)\nThere were similar procedural related details in the 2 groups such as use of stents, administration of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: myocardial injury\n\nNo difference in mean peak troponin level in the oxygen and no oxygen group\n\n57.4 vs 48 mcg/L (CI 0.92-1.56; p=0.18)\n\n\nSignificant increase in mean peak creatinine kinase (CK) in the oxygen group compared with the no oxygen group\n\n1948 vs 1543 U/L (CI 1.04-1.52; p=0.01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nRate of major cardiac arrhythmia (sustained and nonsustained ventricular and atrial tachyarrhythmia) at hospital discharge\n\nNo difference in the oxygen group compared with the no oxygen group\n40.4% vs 31.4% p= 0.05\n\n\n\n\nRecurrent myocardial infarction at hospital discharge\n\nIncreased in the oxygen group compared with the no oxygen group\n5.5% vs 0.9% p=0.006\n\n\nRecurrent myocardial infarction at 6 months\n\nNo significant difference\n7.6% vs 3.6% p=0.07\n\n\nMedian infarct size at 6 months as determined by cardiac MRI (CMR)\n\nIncreased in the oxygen group\n20.3 vs 13.1 p=0.04\nOnly 32% received CMR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdverse events at 6 months: no difference\n\nMajor cardiac events (all cause mortality, recurrent MI, repeat revascularisation, stroke) and STEMI\n\n46 (21.9%) vs 34 (15.4%) p=0.08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThis trial does not provide evidence that routine oxygen therapy for STEMI is beneficial and there is some suggestion that it may increase myocardial injury\n\nStrengths\n\nA relevant clinical question that challenges dogma. Clinical practice guidelines do not currently provide recommendations for oxygen therapy in STEMI\nAllocation concealment\nIntention to treat analysis of primary endpoints\nOnly 3% lost to follow-up\nOutcomes assessed by blinded assessors\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNot generalisable to all AMI, only STEMI\nTreatment not blinded\nPrimary outcome measures are surrogate endpoints\nThe median saturation in the oxygen arm was 100% and 98% in the no oxygen arm. This difference may not be clinically significant. PaO2\u00a0would be a better marker of hyperoxia\nNo information given about the location of the occlusion, although the culprit artery and extent of disease was documented. A more proximal occlusion would cause a greater infarct size and it is not clear if there is a difference between the oxygen and no oxygen group regarding this\nSecondary outcomes were not analysed on a intention to treat basis\nNot powered to detect differences in clinically meaningful outcomes\nOnly 32 % of patients had follow-up cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging which makes interpretation of this result impossible\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial fails to show any benefit in giving oxygen to normoxic patients with STEMI undergoing PCI and may in fact cause harm\nThe results should be interpreted cautiously as the endpoints are surrogate outcomes only\nHowever, there is sound physiological evidence to suggest hyperoxia is harmful\nWe await results of An Efficacy and Outcome Study of Supplemental Oxygen Treatment in Patients With Suspected Myocardial Infarction (DETO2X-AMI) which has clinical meaningful morbidity and mortality outcomes\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract] Air Versus Oxygen in ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction\n[further reading] An Efficacy and Outcome Study of Supplemental Oxygen Treatment in Patients with Suspected Myocardial Infarction (DETO2X-AMI)\n[further reading] 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction\n[further reading] Cabello.
