Lung (2022); DOI:10.1007/s00408-022-00530-5\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients with acute pulmonary embolism and right heart strain does a strategy of volume expansion or early diuretic therapy result in a more rapid resolution of troponin levels?\n\nBackground\n\nAcute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause for hospital presentation\nRight heart strain is associated with an increased mortality in patient\u2019s with PE\nCurrent ESC 2019 guidelines recommend consideration of \u2018cautious fluid loading\u2019 if CVP low\nRight ventricular (RV) dilatation may result in compression of the left ventricle and further compromise cardiac output\n\nThis may be ameliorated by diuretic therapy\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, unblinded parallel group randomised controlled trial\n1:1 randomisation but remainder of randomisation strategy not documented\nWritten informed consent\nNo information regarding allocation concealment\nStudy powered to 90% to demonstrate \u2018superiority of diuretics\u2019 in the normalisation of troponin at 72 hours\n\n44 patient required, but to offset any study exits 60 recruited\nNo mention of anticipated effect sizes\n\n\nTTE performed at admission, 4 hours post treatment and then daily until normalisation or post ICU discharge\n\nAll TTEs were checked by two blinded readers\n\n\nTroponin and BNP were measure on admission, then every 12 hours until normalisation\nMaximum time delay from definitive diagnosis to randomisation was 2 hours, and maximum time from randomisation to treatment was 1 hour\nAll patients followed for at least 30 days\nRegistered on clinical trials.gov (NCT02531581)\n\nSetting\n\nMulti-centre study but number of centres not reported\n\nThe authors were from two hospitals in Cannes and Nice\n\n\nJanuary 2016 \u2013 December 2019\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Patient presenting with acute pulmonary embolism confirmed on CT and all of:\n\nRV Dilatation (measured by RV:LV ratio > 0.9 in apical view or >0.7 in parasternal long axis)\nRV dysfunction tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) < 16mm and RV lateral wall velocity (RV S\u2019) < 10mm/s\nTroponin (Tn) 70ng/L and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) > 100 pg/mL\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nCardiogenic shock\nNeed for thrombolysis\nNeed for catecholamine infusion\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation on admission.\nSevere chronic renal disease (GFR , 30ml/min)\nAn IVC diameter < 21mm\nAlready received fluid or diuretic therapy in the prior 24 hours\nChronic diuretic use\n\n\n181 patients assessed for eligibility\n\n121 excluded\n\nNot meeting inclusion criteria (n=120)\nDeclined consent (n=1)\n\n\n60 randomised\n\n30 volume expansion\n30 diuretic therapy\n\n\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nVery similar between the two groups (volume expansion vs diuretic therapy):\n\nMedian age: 75 vs 71\nMale: 17% vs 20%\nBaseline Vital Signs\n\nMedian SBP (mmHg): 138 vs 132\nMedian HR: 94 vs 91\nSpO2: 95% vs 95%\nOxygen Rate: 3L/min v 3L/min\n\n\nBiomarkers\n\nCreatinine (\u03bcmol/L): 92 vs 89\nTroponin (ng/mL): 456 vs 620\nBNP (pg/mL): 384 vs 407\n\n\nECHO Parameters\n\nRV:LV ratio on 4 chamber view: 1.15 vs 1.1\nTAPSE (mm): 14 vs 13\nRV S\u2019 (mm/s): 9 vs 8\nSystolic pulmonary artery pressure (mmHg) 54 vs 58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nVolume expansion:\n\n500ml Saline infusion over 4 hours\nFollowed by a further 1000ml over 24 hours\n\n\nDiuretic therapy:\n\nIV Furosemide bolus 40mg\nFurther 40mg bolus after four hours in urine output < 500ml in that time period\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nImmediate therapeutic anticoagulation\nThrombolysis if indicated by hypotension of cardiogenic shock\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nNo difference in time to normalisation of Troponin concentrations (< 70 ng/L). 72 vs 76 hours (p = 0.74)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nBiomarkers\n\nLonger time to normalisation of BNP in volume expansion group 108 vs 56 hours (p = 0.05)\nTime to 50% reduction in BNP shorter in diuretic group and greater proportion (47% vs 13%) of participants in diuretic group had reduction in BNP at hour 12\n\n\nECHO Features\n\nSignificantly greater reduction in systolic pulmonary artery pressure at 4 hours in diuretic group: 0 vs -7mmHg (p = 0.006)\n\nThis was not significant at 24 or 48 hours\n\n\nSignificantly greater reduction in IVC diameter at 4 hours: 0 vs -3 mm (p= 0.008)\n\nThis was not significant at 24 or 48 hours\n\n\nNo significant difference in any of the following parameters at 4, 24 or 48 hours:\n\nTAPSE\nRV S\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nA single intravenous bolus of 40 mg furosemide was well-tolerated\nCompared with volume expansion, intravenous diuretic therapy modifies neither Tn kinetics nor RV echocardiographic parameters but accelerates BNP normalization, and reduction in sPAP and IVC diameter significantly\nThese findings, which need to be confirmed in trials with clinical end points, may translate to a rapid improvement in RV function using one-shot diuretic\n\nStrengths\n\nWell designed phase 2 trial\nAddresses a challenging clinical question in which there is little guidance\nDetailed ECHO and biomarker data obtained\nNo loss to follow up\nGood separation between groups with respect to urine output\n\nWeaknesses\n\nLimited methodology provided in the manuscript makes assessing internal validity hard\nThis was a Phase 2 trial that can only be hypothesis generating and further studies would be required prior to implementation in clinical practice\nAlthough the use of troponin or BNP at presentation has been used to risk stratify patients, it may not follow that normalisation of these biomarkers equates to improved prognosis\nThe conclusion that RV function may be improved by the administration of diuretics is not directly supported by the trial data\nThere was no measurement of cardiac output which may have been informative\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhen performing ECHO routinely on patients with PE,\u00a0 right ventricular dysfunction is present in a high proportion (33% in this study)\nDiuretics will likely reduce right atrial pressure and pulmonary artery pressure when given to these patients but it is not clear this will change outcomes\nI will continue to aim to provide a tailored approach to maintain cardiac output in patients with PE \u2013 this may include modifying pre-load with fluid or diuretics, contractility with inodilators, and afterload with vasodilators and anticoagulants\n\nExternal Links\n\nArticle: Diuretics vs Volume
