Intensive Care Medicine 2022. doi: 10.1007/s00134-022-06638-9\nClinical Question\n\nIn adults with an expected ICU stay of > 72 hours, does the provision of enteral melatonin compared to placebo increase the number of delirium-free assessments within 14 days or before ICU discharge?\n\nBackground\n\nDelirium is highly prevalent in ICU with associated increased mortality and morbidity\nMelatonin concentrations are lower in those patient with delirium compared to those without\nMelatonin has been shown to speed up sleep initiation and improve sleep efficiency without changing the sleep cycle\nSmall and predominantly single centre studies have shown a benefit of melatonin improving delirium rates; however these results haven\u2019t been reproduced in large, multi-centre RCTs\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial\nRandomised in 1:1 ratio via compute generated list\nStratified by site in blocks of 6\nMelatonin and placebo manufactured in liquid form with identical physical characteristics\nCAM-ICU assessment tool performed twice daily on all assessable patients\nSub-set of patients had serum melatonin concentrations measured 2-3 hours post administration\nLocal ethical approval\nDMSB included a sleep physician\nSample size\n\nBased on prospective data from two main hospital sites involved\n54% assessments deemed delirium free (SD 45%)\nTo detect a 10% absolute increase in delirium free assessments with 80% power and alpha of 0.05 required 319 patients in each arm\nRounded to 425 patients in each group to allow for non-parametric tests, missing data and loss to follow-up\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n12 ICUs in Australia\nJuly 2016 \u2013 September 2019\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdults (>18 yo)\nAdmitted to ICU with an expected LOS > 72 hours\nWithin 48 hours of ICU admission\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nAlready receiving melatonin\nPregnancy / Breastfeeding\nExpected death within 48 hours\nTreating clinician believed that a delirium assessment within the next 14 days would not be possible due to persistent neurological dysfunction\nNo enteral route\nHepatic impairment\n\n\n2764 met inclusion criteria\n\n1478 excluded \u2013> 1286 eligible\n847 enrolled\n\n\nBaseline demographics similar (comparing melatonin vs placebo)\n\nAge: 62 vs 62\nRegular alcohol use: 34% vs 39%\nPast psychiatric presentation: 16 vs 18%\nPre-DELIRIC score: 45.3 vs 42.7\nCAM +ve at baseline: 10% vs 8%\nEmergency ICU admission: 82% vs 80%\nSepsis as diagnosis: 24% vs 23%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nMelatonin\n\n4mg (2mls) at 21:00 for 14 nights or until ICU discharge\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\n2mls of placebo at the same time\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll other care at treating clinicians discretion\nStaff advised to de-sedate patients as much as possible and allow flexibility in time of CAM-ICU assessment to minimise un-assessable patients\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nNumber of delirium free assessments per patient: 79.2% (melatonin) vs. 80.0% (placebo); p = 0.547\n\nComparing melatonin group vs placebo group:\n\nNumber of assessments performed: 2975 vs 2846\nNumber of assessments per patient (median): 5 vs 6\nNumber of non-assessable time points: 19.8% vs 17.7%\nNumber of missed time points: 16.6% vs 17.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nComparing melatonin vs placebo\nNo significant difference in\n\nAverage percentage of delirium free days: 79.5% vs. 80.2%\nAverage percentage of delirium and coma free days: 64.2% vs 67.6%\n\n\nParticipants with delirium: 35.1% vs 32.7%\nNo difference in sleep quantity or quality\n\n> 40% in both groups had sleep quality and quantity rated as poor or very poor\n\n\nRequirement for anti-psychotics: 21.2% vs 19.4%\nICU LOS: 5 vs 5 days\nHospital LOS: 14 vs 12 days\n90 day mortality: 15.5% vs 15.6%\n\n\n\n\nSubgroups:\n\nNo difference in any subgroup (Age, Sex, Baseline delirium state, ICU diagnosis and risk of delirium by pre-DELIRIC)\n\n\nNo adverse events in any group\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nEnteral melatonin within 48 hours of ICU admission did not reduce the prevalence of delirium compared to placebo\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre\nRandomised\nDouble-blind and placebo controlled\nPre-published statistical analysis plan\nLocal data used in sample size calculation\nMinimal loss to follow up (increases power of study)\nPlausible rationale for use of melatonin and data collected to show that melatonin levels increased post administration\n\nMedian serum concentration was 19.4 ng/ml in melatonin group vs < 0.1 ng/ml in placebo\n\n\nExcellent collection of data (pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies) that could act as confounders\nLargest study to date regarding a treatment which is widely used with a mixed, limited and heterogenous evidence base\n\nWeaknesses\n\nLarge numbers excluded. Of those screened:\n\n~10% were not expected to improve within 14 days\n\u00a0~7% unable to perform CAM-ICU for preceding reason\n~11% other\n\n\nRates of missed assessments were marginally higher than expected, and allowed for in the sample size calculation\n~9% were CAM +ve at baseline\nOnly one dosing regime used for all patients \u2013 would a higher dose or SR release formulation be more appropriate?\n\nThe authors provide a solid rationale for the decision to use 4mg \u2013 10mg has been shown to have supratherapeutic day time level\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial provides high quality evidence that although safe, 4mg melatonin does not affect rates of delirium\nInterestingly sleep quantity and quality was not improved (albeit as a secondary outcome); this will make me re-consider my use of melatonin routinely\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Prophylactic melatonin for delirium in intensive care (Pro-MEDIC): a randomized controlled trial\neditorial Melatonin in ICU delirium: shining light on the hormone of darkness\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker @hgmwalker89\nSummary date: 5th December 2022\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\nPicture by: nambitomo/iStock\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
