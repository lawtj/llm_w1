This was after a number of ambulance services withdrew from the trial following the adverse press reports and political lobbying!\nOnly 16 patients survived to hospital discharge therefore unable to make any definite conclusions\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAdrenaline increased ROSC following cardiac arrest. However there was no improvement in survival to hospital discharge or neurological outcome. Other trials, including the trial by Hagihara\u00a0have provided some evidence that neurological outcome is worse in patients that are treated with adrenaline. Therefore we need to support a larger trial to determine the final answer.\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf / abstract / doi: 10.1016/j.resuscitation.2011.06.029\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\nNone\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 16 May 2014\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@stevemathieu75\n\n\n\n"
