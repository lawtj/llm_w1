Effort should be made to record baseline function and frailty, and further research should investigate how this aids decision making.\n\nStrengths\n\nImportant and topical clinical question\nPragmatic design \u2013 authors acknowledge that the selected longitudinal cohort\u00a0group will have selection bias, and validated statistical methods were used to obtain an accurate estimate for the unselected hospital cohort\u00a0group\nSensitivity analyses \u2013 suggested that the estimates obtained were robust, accurate and reliable\nGood external validity \u2013 included medical and surgical patients, with a range of diagnoses, co-morbidities and physiological disturbance from multiple hospitals\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSmall risk of attrition bias \u2013 follow-up complete for 83% of\u00a0longitudinal cohort\nLimitations to external validity \u2013 majority were white Caucasian, and all from Canada; 12 month recovery of function is very dependent on rehabilitation and social care services, which can differ substantially between countries.\nInternal validity concerns \u2013 the statistics are complicated and difficult to verify; the authors reassure readers that the methods are valid and the impact of the selection bias is easily adjusted for, but the outcomes for the unselected group are still only adjusted estimates\nClinical implementation \u2013 the comprehensive geriatric assessment required trained research personnel; this is not something that working clinicians can easily repeat for each patient over 80, and certainly not in an emergency to aid decisions; shorter tools need to be validated before frailty and functional assessment can be relied upon clinically\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPatients over 80 years old admitted to ICU for more than 24 hours have a poor recovery profile: 25% return to baseline after a year, 25% are alive but significantly worse than baseline and 50% are dead.\nThese data appear reliable and generalisable to most developed healthcare systems, and this might help guide communication and decision making with patients, families and referring clinicians.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Recovery after critical illness in patients aged 80 years or older: a multi-center prospective observational cohort study\n[further reading]\u00a0Prevalence and impact of frailty on mortality in elderly ICU patients: a prospective, multicenter, observational study by Le Maguet\u00a0and review of this study by Portsmouth ICU Journal Club\n[further reading]\u00a0Frailty by LITFL\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 18 November 2015\nPeer-review editor: @SteveMathieu75\n\n\n"
