Data also show that it has activity against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)\nWith the current SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 epidemic, it is important to identify and evaluate medications for safety and efficacy\nYoung et al published a case series in JAMA on March 3, 2020 describing 5 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir, showing variable results\n\nDesign\n\nRandomized, controlled, open-label trial\nWeb based randomization\nBlock randomisation stratified on basis of respiratory support\nPlacebo controls were not used due to the emergent nature of the trial\nPrimary efficacy analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis\nPrimary outcome assessed up to day 28\nOriginal sample size of 160 would have provided 80% power to detect a difference, at a two-sided significance level of \u03b1=0.05, of 8 days in the median time to clinical improvement between the two groups, assuming that the median time in the standard-care group was 20 days and that 75% of the patients would reach clinical improvement\nRegistered on Chinese Clinical Trial Registry\n\nSetting\n\nJin Yin-Tan Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China\nData collected: January 18, 2020, through February 3, 2020\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Male and non-pregnant female patients 18 years of age or older were eligible with the following:\n\nDiagnostic specimen that was positive on reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2\nPneumonia confirmed by chest imaging\nOxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) (Pao2:Fio2) at or below 300 mg Hg\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nPhysician decision that involvement in the trial was not in the patient\u2019s best interest\nPresence of any condition that would not allow the protocol to be followed safely\nKnown allergy or hypersensitivity to lopinavir\u2013ritonavir\nKnown severe liver disease\nUse of medications that are contraindicated with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir and that could not be replaced or stopped during the trial period\nPregnancy or breast-feeding\nKnown HIV infection\n\n\n199 patients underwent randomization; 99 patients assigned to lopinavir\u2013ritonavir and 100 patients to standard care alone\nNo significant between-group differences in demographic characteristics\n\nMedian age 58\nMedian interval time between symptom onset and randomization was 13 days\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nLopinavir\u2013ritonavir\n\n400mg/100mg orally or via nasogastric tube plus standard care for 14 days\n5 patients in the treatment group did not receive the intervention\n\n2 due to attending physician\u2019s discretion\n3 had early death within 24 hours after randomization\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard care alone for 14 days\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nStandard care comprised, as necessary, supplemental oxygen, noninvasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, vasopressor support, renal-replacement therapy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: time to clinical improvement, or live discharge from hospital \u2013\u00a0no significant difference\n\nMedian, 16 day vs. 16 days; hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI of difference), 0.95 to 1.85; P=0.09\n\u00a0Defined as the time from randomization to an improvement of two points (from the status at randomization) on a seven-category ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital, whichever came first\n\n1 = not hospitalized with resumption of normal activities\n2= not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities\n3,= hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen\n4 = hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen\n5 = hospitalized, requiring nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or both\n6 = hospitalized, requiring ECMO, invasive mechanical ventilation\n7 = death\n\n\n\n\nModified intention-to-treat population excluding 3 early deaths \u2013 significantly lower in intervention group\n\nMedian time to clinical improvement was 15 days in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group, as compared with 16 days in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes\u00a0\n\nIn intervention group significant improvements in:\n\nDuration of intensive care stay\n\nmedian, 6 days vs. 11 days (95% CI of difference, \u22129 to 0)\n\n\nDuration of hospitalization in survivors\n\nmedian, 12 days vs. 14 days (95% CI, 0 to 3)\n\n\n% of patients with clinical improvement at\n\nday 14\n\n45% vs. 30% (95% CI, 2.2 to 28.8)\n\n\nday 28\n\n79% vs. 70% (95% CI, -3.3 to 20.9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\n% of patients with clinical improvement at day 7\n\n6% vs. 2% (95% CI, -1.4 to 9.5)\n\n\nMortality at day 28\n\n19.2% vs. 25.0% (95% CI, \u221217.3 to 5.7)\n\n\nDuration of mechanical ventilation\n\nmedian 4 days vs. 5 days (95% CI, \u22124 to 2)\n\n\nTime from treatment initiation to death\n\nmedian 9 days vs. 12 days (95% CI, \u22126 to 2)\n\n\nProportions with viral RNA detection over time\nViral RNA titer area-under-the-curve (AUC) measurements\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nLopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment did not significantly accelerate clinical improvement, reduce mortality, or diminish throat viral RNA detectability in patients with serious Covid-19\n\nStrengths\n\nConducted with quick response to the identification of the pandemic nature of SARS-CoV-2\nAuthors obtained informed consent from patients or their legal representatives\nRegistered on Chinese trial registry\nAllocation concealment maintained through use of web randomisation\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOpen label design meant a lack of blinding, which could have introduced bias\nNo long-term data are available\nThe median time to treatment was 13 days, so it\u2019s possible that the treatment was initiated too late and earlier treatment would be more effective\nNearly 14% of the lopinavir-ritonavir group did not complete treatment due to side effects\nThe authors state that once the original planned sample size of 160 was reached, they continued enrolment as it was determined that the study was underpowered, however they do not comment on whether the final population of 199 allowed them to achieve their desired power\n\nBecause of the negative results of the trial, an underpowered study could expose these results to Type II error (falsely negative results)\n\n\nPlan for modified intention to treat analysis was not described in clinical trial registration\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn this single centre, non-blinded, randomised controlled trial, for a subset of patients treated in Wuhan, China, lopinavir-ritonavir did not demonstrate efficacy in reducing mortality and did not reduce viral loads or duration of viral detectability\nDue to the fact that in this study the median time to treatment was 13 days we cannot determine if earlier detection and treatment could be effective, and more studies would be required to investigate this\n\nExternal Links\n\nA Trial of Lopinavir\u2013Ritonavir in Adults Hospitalized with Severe Covid-19\nEpidemiologic Features and Clinical Course of Patients Infected With SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore\nPulmCrit- Is Lopinavir/Ritonavir down and out?\nREBEL EM: Lopinavir-Ritonavir in Hospitalized Patients with Severe COVID-19\nINTENSIVE Blog review\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Daniel Hu, PharmD, BCCCP\u00a0\nSummary date: 3/19/20\nPeer-review editor: dave slessor\n\n\n"
