Crit Care Resusc 2021; 23(1):32 \u2013 46\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult trauma patients with major haemorrhage and hypofibrinogenaemia\u00a0 does the use fibrinogen concentrate (FC) compared to cryoprecipitate (cryo) result in a shorter time to administration?\n\nBackground\n\nFibrinogen plays a critical role in haemostasis and the management of trauma induced coagulopathy (TIC)\n\nIn bleeding trauma patients, low fibrinogen has been independently associated with an increased risk of mortality and the administration of cryoprecipitate has been shown to increase survival in these patients\n\n\nThe European guideline on management of major trauma and haemorrhage suggest fibrinogen supplementation if either viscoleastic testing (TEG/ROTEM) suggest a fibrinogen deficiency of plasma Clauss fibrinogen level < 1.5 g/L\n\nA dose of 3-4g fibrinogen (either as FC or cryo) is suggested\n\n\nThe CRYOSTAT trial conducted at two UK trauma centres showed that administration of cryoprecipitate (10 units) in addition to the empiric massive haemorrhage pack (6u PRBC, 4u FFP +/- TXA) was feasible, and raised fibrinogen levels\n\nIn this trial, the mean time to administration was 60 minutes\n\n\nFC is a virally inactivated powder, with a long shelf life that needs to be reconstituted\n\nThis theoretically could result in faster administration times compared to cryo due to the fact it does not need to be thawed and sent from a blood bank\n\n\nTo date there is no evidence for the use of FC use in TIC, and trials have had mixed results with regards to the feasibility of its use:\n\nThe Canadian FiiRST trial reported its use feasible (96% of patients received FC within 1hr of admission) however, the E-FIT1 trial in the UK concluded its use was not feasible (only 69% were administered FC within 45 minutes)\nNeither trials found a reduction in 28 day all cause mortality or blood transfusion requirements\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nInvestigator-initiated, multicentre, randomised controlled pilot study\nRandomly assigned to an intervention arm 1:1\n\nWeb based, block randomisation produced by independent statistician accommodating possibility of unequal patient recruitment across the four sites\n\n\nROTEM used to guide need for fibrinogen supplementation\n\nA5 < 10mm\n\n\nTreating clinicians not blinded, although outcome assessors and statistician remained blinded\nTwo planned interim analysis at 33 and 67 patients by DSMC to assess differential proportions of all-cause hospital mortality\nEthics approval granted\nIf unable to consent initially then emergency consent granted and consent to continue subsequently sought\nRegistered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02745041)\nPer-protocol analysis \u2013 included only patients who were administered study drug (randomised patients only given study drug if they also met ROTEM criteria)\n\nSetting\n\n4 major trauma centres in QLD, Australia\nDecember 2016 \u2013 September 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdult > 18 years\nClinically significant haemorrhage\nABC score > 2 or potential for massive transfusion\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nInjuries incompatible with survival\n> 6 hours from injury to presentation\nPrior FC or cryo supplementation\nKnown coagulation disorder\nKnown objection to blood product transfusion\nPregnant\nEnrolled in competing trial\n\n\nAimed to enroll 100 patients\n\nBased on estimated recruitment rates and budget\nIf 100 enrolled in 1:1 manner then there would be an 80% power to detect a difference of +/- 8 minutes between FC and cryo treatment intervals (with alpha of 0.05)\n114 patients eligible\n\n14 not enrolled (6 missed, 6 died prior and 2 other)\n50 allocated to each arm\n\n\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nGenerally similar \u2013 higher rates of pre-hospital intubation and lower pre-hospital GCS and SBP in FC group\n\u00a0Note the data below is as for all randomly allocated patients regardless of whether FC or cryo was administered\n\nAge: 44 (FC) vs 48 (cryo)\nMale: 76% vs 78%\nISS: 26 vs 26\nBlunt Injury: 76% vs 80%\nPre-hospital PRBC: 1u vs 1u\nTXA: 78% v 65%\nPre-hospital\n\nLowest GCS: 3 (3 \u2013 14) vs 12 (3 \u2013 15)\nIntubation: 57% vs 35%\nHighest HR: 121 vs 120\nLowest SBP: 83 vs 91\n\n\nLaboratory\n\npH: 7.24 vs 7.31\nBE: -7.4 vs -4.6\nLactate: 3.8 vs 2.7\nINR: 1.4 vs. 1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nFibrinogen concentrate\n\nIf ROTEM FIBTEM A5 < 10mm then FC administered\nDosage adjusted based on A5 value (ranging from 6g if A5 0mm to 2g if A5 9-10mm)\n37/50 patients received FC\n\n\n\nControl\n\nCryoprecipitate\n\nIf ROTEM FIBTEM A5 < 10mm then cryo administered\nDosage adjusted based on A5 value (ranging from 20 units A5 0mm to 8u if A5 9-10mm)\n25/50 patients received cryo\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nROTEM repeated after 10 minutes\nDosing repeated as per protocol if A5 remained < 10mm\nIf > 10mm then testing repeated as clinically indicated and after every 4u PRBC.

however without larger trials it is difficult to routinely recommend the use of FC for all patients with traumatic haemorrhage\nBased on this trial the use of FC may have benefits in traumatic bleeding where there is no or limited provision of cryoprecipitate\nThe CRYOSTAT 2 trial will provide further large scale randomised evidence as to the benefit of fibrinogen replacement\n\nExternal Links\n\nCRYOSTAT 2\nEuropean guideline on management of major trauma and haemorrhage\nFibrinogen levels during trauma haemorrhage\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker @hgmwalker89\nSummary date: 29th March 2021\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\nImage by: iStock\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
