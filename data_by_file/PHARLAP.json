AJRCCM July 2019; DOI: 10.1164/rccm.201901-0109OC\nClinical Question\n\nDoes an open lung ventilation strategy which includes maximal recruitment maneuvers (RMs) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration improve outcomes compared to traditional lung-protective ventilation in patients with moderate \u2013 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)?\n\nBackground\n\nIn ARDS, the injured lung is often conceptualized as containing two physiologically distinct regions: a small aerated \u201cbaby lung\u201d and a consolidated gasless compartment (DOI 10.1007/s00134-015-4200-8)\nInterventions such as RMs, high PEEP, and prone positioning may increase the size of the baby lung through alveolar recruitment\u00a0\n\u201cOpen lung ventilation\u201d describes a general approach to mechanical ventilation that aims to \u201copen the lung and keep it open.\u201d RMs are used to maximize alveolar recruitment. PEEP is then titrated to prevent downstream derecruitment. This strategy is typically paired with low-tidal-volume ventilation to limit volutrauma\nThe benefits of such an approach, and the best means to achieve it, remain a source of debate (DOI https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-019-05734-7)\nThe use of RMs in patients with moderate \u2013 severe ARDS received a conditional recommendation in recent consensus guidelines on mechanical ventilation ARDS (https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.201703-0548ST)\n\nDesign\n\nMulticenter prospective randomized phase II clinical trial\nBlinding not performed given the nature of the intervention\nRandomization performed using a web-based system. Patients randomized in a 1:1 fashion with permuted blocks, stratified for site and for cause of ARDS\nPower calculation\n\nInvestigators estimated 340 patients would be required to provide 80% power to detect a difference equal to 33% of a standard deviation (3 ventilator free days [VFD]) with a 2-sided P\u00a0value of 0.05\nThis power calculation allowed for up to a 5% withdrawal or loss to long-term follow up\n\n\nAnalysis was performed using an intention-to-treat approach\n\nSetting\n\n35 intensive care units (ICUs) in 5 countries (Australia, Ireland, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom)\nOctober 2012 to September 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nIntubated and receiving mechanical ventilation\nDuration of mechanical ventilation \u2264 72 hours for a diagnosis of moderate \u2013 severe ARDS as defined by the Berlin conference criteria\n\n\nExclusion:\n\n< 16 years of age\n> 72 hours since the diagnosis of ARDS\nMechanical ventilation > 10 days\nBarotrauma\nChest trauma\nActive bronchospasm or history of significant obstructive lung disease\nClinical suspicion of significant restrictive lung disease\nConcern for elevated intracranial pressure\nUnstable cardiovascular status\nPregnant\nReceiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)\nUse of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)\nImminent death\nRefusal of the treating physician\n\n\nTrial enrollment\n\n835 patients assessed for eligibility\n175 eligible but not enrolled\n\nThe most common reason not to be enrolled was clinician preference (50%)\n\n\n115 randomized (58 in intervention arm and 57 in the control arm)\n1 patient withdrew consent in each arm\nPrimary analysis includes 57 patients in the intervention arm and 56 patients in the control arm\nNo patients were lost to follow-up\n\n\nBaseline characteristics were well matched\n\nAge: \u224854 years\nCause of ARDS: pneumonia (61%), extra-pulmonary (21%)\nTime since onset of ARDS: \u224818 hrs\nVasoactive medicines: 82%\nCRRT: 19%\nNeuromuscular blockade: 57%\nProne positioning: 4%\nPaO2/FiO2: \u2248129\nTidal volume (VT): \u22487 mL/kg PBW\nPplt: \u224828 cmH2O\nPEEP: \u224813 cmH2O\nRespiratory system compliance: \u2248 31 mL/cmH2O\n\n\n\nIntervention (PHARLAP strategy)\n\nFollowing randomization, patients placed on pressure controlled ventilation, Pinsp\u00a015 +/- 3 cmH2O to achieve a goal VT\u00a04 \u2013 6 mL/Kg PBW. PEEP kept at pre-randomization level\nIn the absence of contraindications, a combined open lung procedure (COLP) was performed at least daily until day 5 (or until day 3 if there was no improvement in static lung compliance from baseline \u2013 day 3)\nThe COLP consisted of the following\n\nStaircase recruitment maneuver (SRM)\n\nFiO2\u00a0adjusted to maintain arterial saturation 90 \u2013 92% for 15 min\nPEEP increased to 20 cmH2O\nStep-wise increases in PEEP every 2 minutes to 30 cmH2O and then 40 cmH2O\nProcedure terminated if evidence of hemodynamic instability, SpO2< 85%, or new air leak through existing chest tube.

This intervention was associated with increased cardiovascular events but reduced use of rescue therapies for hypoxemia\n\nStrengths\n\nMultinational group of study centers increases generalizability of the results\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nBaseline characteristics were well balanced between the two study arms\nHigh adherence to trial protocol in the intervention arm\nNo patients lost to follow-up\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe trial was stopped short of its enrollment goal as the study management committee felt equipoise to continue the trial was lost after the publication of the ART trial (https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/art/) which showed a signal of harm in patients randomized to receive aggressive RMs paired with PEEP titrated to best respiratory system compliance\n21% of patients in the control arm received a non-protocolized RM\n90% of COLPs were performed by ICU consultants. This level of involvement by senior members of the ICU team likely does not reflect usual practice at many centers\nMechanical ventilation in the control arm was guided by the ARDSnet low PEEP/high FiO2 table. It is difficult to know if the improved respiratory variables in the intervention arm (e.g. higher PaO2/FiO2, lower driving pressure, less need for rescue therapies) were simply a consequence of the patients in the intervention arm receiving higher PEEP and unrelated to the COLP. A similar concern was raised with the findings of the first EPVent study (https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/epvent2/)\nThe low utilization of prone positioning is at odds with the strong recommendation for proning in patients with severe ARDS (https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.201703-0548ST)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study, when considered with the ART trial and the updated post-hoc meta-analysis performed by the authors, suggests that an open lung ventilation approach does not improve patient-centered outcomes when used broadly in patients with moderate \u2013 severe ARDS\nWhile the striking signal of harm seen in the intervention arm of ART was not seen in this study (perhaps due to protocol differences or the high level of ICU consultant involvement during COLPs in PHARLAP), the results do suggest that aggressive RMs are associated with adverse hemodynamic effects\nI agree with the authors\u2019 hypothesis that there are likely to be sub-phenotypes of ARDS patients who may uniquely benefit from an open lung approach. However, before searching for a small subpopulation who may benefit from an intervention of unclear efficacy, I think the Critical Care community as a whole should focus on efforts to increase utilization of evidence-based strategies like prone positioning (https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/proseva-study-group-prone-positioning-in-severe-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/)\nI will continue to not use an open lung ventilation strategy as a routine part of my management of patients with moderate \u2013 severe ARDS\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Maximal Recruitment Open Lung Ventilation in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (PHARLAP): A Phase II, Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Trial\n[further reading] Effect of Lung Recruitment and Titrated Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) vs Low PEEP on Mortality in Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Randomized Clinical Trial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:James M.
