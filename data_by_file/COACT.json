New England Journal of Medicine 2019; doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1816897\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients who have sustained an out of hospital arrhythmia-associated cardiac arrest without an ST-elevation myocardial infarction, is immediate angiography superior to delayed angiography in improving 90-day survival?\n\nBackground\n\nPercutaneous coronary intervention has been shown to improve mortality in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\nThe benefit of early angiography in post-cardiac arrest patients with no STEMI is uncertain.\nData from observational studies has suggested that early coronary intervention may provide a survival benefit in these patients\nThe incidence of coronary artery disease is high in this group of patients, however a randomised controlled trial assessing thrombolysis in all-comers following out of hospital arrest showed no survival benefit\nThis is the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessing early angiography in patients who have an out of hospital cardiac arrest without STEMI\nTwo further RCTs are currently recruiting patients in an attempt to answer this question ACCESS trial; DISCO trial\n\nDesign\n\nInvestigator-initiated, randomised, open-label, multicentre trial\nPatients randomised in a 1:1 ratio with the use of a web-based randomisation system\nStudy powered at 85% power to detect a 40% relative difference in 90-day survival between the immediate angiography and delayed angiography groups\nAdaptive design that allowed for an increase in sample size if survival benefit was substantial but smaller than the 40% relative difference\nData and Safety Monitoring Board was allowed to recommend an increase in sample size after an interim analysis\n\nSetting\n\n19 participating centres in the Netherlands\n\nThe majority of patients were recruited in the major tertiary centres in Amsterdam and Rotterdam\n\n\nJanuary 2015 \u2013 July 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Patients who had an out of hospital arrest with an initial shockable rhythm and who were unconscious after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)\nExclusion:\n\nSigns of STEMI on the ECG at the emergency department (including new LBBB or isolated ST depression in V1-V3 due to an true posterior infarct)\nHemodynamic instability unresponsive to medical therapy\n\nDefined as a prolonged (>30 min) systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg at the time of screening\n\n\nAn obvious or suspected non-coronary cause of the arrest\nA known severe renal dysfunction (GFR<30 ml/min)\nObvious or suspected pregnancy\nSuspected or confirmed acute intracranial bleeding\nSuspected or confirmed acute stroke\nKnown limitations in therapy or DO Not Resuscitate-order\nKnown pre-arrest Cerebral Performance Category 3 or 4\n>4 hours (from return of spontaneous circulation to screening)\nRefractory ventricular arrhythmia\nKnown inability to complete 90-day follow-up\n\n\n538 patients randomised\nBaseline variables were similar between the two groups apart from immediate angiography group had a longer median time to target temperature (5.4 vs 4.7 hours)\n\nIntervention\n\nCoronary angiography as soon as possible and initiated within 2 hours after randomisation\n\nControl\n\nCoronary angiography performed after neurological recovery, in general after discharge from the Intensive Care Unit\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nIf patients showed signs of cardiogenic shock, recurrent life-threatening arrhythmias, or recurrent ischaemia during hospitalisation, urgent angiography was performed\nChoice of anticoagulant and revascularisation strategy left to the discretion of the treating physicians\nAll coronary lesions suspected of being unstable recommended for treatment\n\nUnstable lesions defined as coronary lesions with at least 70% stenosis and the presence of characteristics of plaque disruption\n\n\nIn patients with multi-vessel disease, treating physicians were advised to use a revascularisation strategy that was based on local protocol and the Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score \u2013 this is a complexity score for coronary angiography\nPost-resuscitation care was in line with international resuscitation guidelines\nTargeted temperature management was initiated as soon as possible, according to local protocol\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: No statistical difference in survival at 90 days\n\n176 of 273 patients (64.5%) in the immediate angiography group and 178 of 265 patients (67.2%) in the delayed angiography group were alive at 90 days\n\nOdds ratio: 0.89 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.72; p=0.51)\n\n\nDeaths: 3 x more likely to be due to a neurological, rather than a cardiac cause\nComparing immediate angiography group vs delayed angiography group\n\nMedian time from randomisation to coronary angiography: 0.8 hours vs 119.9 hours\nAcute thrombotic occlusion found in 3.4% vs 7.6% of patients\nPCI was performed in 33.0% vs 24.2% of patients\n\n\nPatients assigned to the strategy of immediate angiography were more often treated with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nNo difference in survival with good cerebral performance\n\nImmediate angiography (62.9%) vs delayed angiography (64.4%)\n\nOR 0.94 (CI 0.66 to 1.31)\n\n\n\n\nNo difference in the following:\n\nSurvival to ICU discharge\nMajor bleeding\nRecurrence of arrhythmia\nTime of inotrope support\nDuration of mechanical ventilation\nNeed for renal replacement therapy\n\n\nThe immediate angiography group took longer to achieve targeted temperature than the delayed angiography group\n\n5.4 hours vs. 4.7 hours\nOR 1.19 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.36)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn this randomised, multicenter trial involving patients who were successfully resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and who had a shockable rhythm and no signs of STEMI or a non-coronary cause of the arrest, a strategy of immediate angiography was not better than a strategy of delayed angiography with respect to overall survival at 90 days\n\nStrengths\n\nThis study addressed an important area of research in cardiac arrest management\nAppropriately powered to detect a difference in a patient-centred outcome\nPatients were well-matched at baseline\nPost cardiac arrest management in the Netherlands is likely to be similar to most developed world ICU settings\nA standardised approach was used for coronary intervention\nThe adaptive study design would have allowed for an adjustment in the sample size if this had been necessary\nThere was minimal crossover between study arms and an intention to treat analysis was used\nThe randomisation process was robust and patients were well separated in delivery of the intervention\nThe subgroup analysis is hypothesis generating for future studies assessing potentially higher risk groups (e.g. age > 70 years of age)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nExternal validity is limited by the study only being performed in the Netherlands\nBlinding was not possible due to the nature of the intervention\nThe difference in time to targeted temperature management between the study arms may have been a confounding factor\nThe predicted relative improvement in 90-day survival of 40% was unrealistic for the potential benefit in the timing of a single intervention\nAcute unstable coronary lesions were found in only 20% of the trial cohort\nCoronary interventions were performed in fewer than 40% of patients\nNarrower inclusion criteria may have identified a higher-risk group of patients\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients who have had an out of hospital cardiac arrest without ST elevation myocardial infarction, who have no evidence of cardiogenic shock or recurrent arrhythmias, a strategy of good supportive management without the need for immediate coronary intervention, would seem reasonable in most instances, based on this well-performed study.\nI would still advocate for early angiography in patients with a good history of ischaemic symptoms prior to arrest and in those with a significant cardiac history\nI await the publication of the ACCESS and DISCO studies to further refine my practice\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Coronary Angiography after Cardiac Arrest without ST-Segment Elevation\n[editorial] Coronary Angiography after Cardiac Arrest \u2014 The Right Timing or the Right Patients?\n[further reading] ACCESS to the Cardiac Cath Lab in Patients Without STEMI Resuscitated From Out-of-hospital VT/VF Cardiac Arrest\n[further reading] Direct or Subacute Coronary Angiography in Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest (DISCO)\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Fraser Magee\nSummary date: 5th April 2019\nPeer-review editor: Steve Mathieu\n\n\n"
