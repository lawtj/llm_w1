N Engl J Med 2000; 342:1301-1308.\nClinical Question\n\n\nIn patients with Acute Lung Injury (ALI) or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), does ventilation with lower tidal volumes compared with traditional higher tidal volumes reduce death or ventilator-free days?\n\n\nDesign\n\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\n2\u00d72 study combined with ketoconazole treatment (published separately)\nOriginal study was called KARMA and was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of Ketoconazole and Respiratory Management in the treatment of ALI and ARDS\nThe Ketoconazole arm of the study was later stopped due to an inability to show efficacy\n\nSetting\n\n\n\n10 university-associated hospitals across the USA\nMarch 1996 to March 1999\n\nPopulation\n\n\n\nInclusion: mechanically ventilated adult patients with ALI or ARDS\nDefinition: PaO2/FiO2 < 300mmHg; bilateral pulmonary infiltrates; no clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension or (if measured) a PCWP 18mmH or less\nExclusion: pregnancy; neuropathies; chronic lung disease; severe burns\n861 participants\n\nIntervention\n\n\n\nLow tidal volume ventilation with protocol for limiting plateau pressures and respiratory acidaemia\n\nVolume-assist-control ventilation with 6 ml/kg/breath (ideal body weight)\nPlateau pressure < 30 cm water\n\n\n\nControl\n\n\n\nTraditional, higher, tidal volume ventilation with similar protocol\n\nVolume-assist-control ventilation with 12ml/kg/breath (ideal body weight)\nPlateau pressure < 50 cm water\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\n\n1st Primary outcome: reduced mortality favoured lower volume ventilation\n\n39.8% vs 31.0% (p=0.007)\n\n\n2nd Primary outcome: increased ventilator-free days favoured lower volume ventilation\n\n12+/-11 days vs 10 +/-11 days (p=0.007)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusion\n\n\nThis lower-tidal-volume protocol should be used in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nStrengths\n\n\nWell designed methodology for the clinical question\nAdequately powered to detect small difference in primary outcome\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\n\nAs a group sequential clinical trial, it will statistically favour a positive outcome.\nOnly single-blinded: clinician aware of allocation, but no apparent difference in care provided with exception of PEEP level.\nThe small between group difference in PEEP level may favour the intervention group.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\nAdult patients with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome should be ventilated with tidal volumes of 6 ml/kg, limiting plateau pressures to 30 cm water.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf / abstract / doi: 10.1056/NEJM200005043421801\nEditorials, Commentaries or Blogs\n\nCorrespondence by various authors.\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: May 2014\nPeer-review editor: @stevemathieu75\n\n\n\n\n"
