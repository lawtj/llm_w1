The Lancet 2008; 371:126-134. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60105-1\nClinical Question\n\nIn mechanically ventilated and sedated patients, do Spontaneous Awakening Trials (SAT) in addition to Spontaneous Breathing Trials (SBT) reduce dependence on mechanical ventilation?\n\nDesign\n\nMulticentre, randomised controlled trial\n1:1 computer-generated block randomisation stratified by centre\nSealed envelope concealed assignment\nUnblinded due to pragmatic limitations\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nPowered at 80% to detect a 25% increase in the primary end-point with a two sided significance level of 0.05, based on mean ventilator-free days of 12.9 (SD 10.4) in pilot study.\n\n20% chance of false negative\n5% change of false positive\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nFour large medical centers in the USA\nOctober 2003 \u2013 March 2004\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: adult, medical patients expected to receive mechanical ventilation for 12h or more\nExclusion: mechanical ventilation lasting longer than 2 weeks, cardiopulmonary arrest, profound neurological deficits, moribund, withdrawal of life support, enrolment in another trial\nAll new admissions screened according to enrolment criteria (1658 patients)\n338 patients randomised\n\nIntervention\n\nSpontaneous Awakening Trial (SAT)\n\nProcess: de-sedated for up to 4 hours\n\nSedatives and analgesics used for sedation were interrupted\nAnalgesics for pain relief were continued\n\n\nCriteria for failure were:\n\nDid not open their eyes to verbal stimulation\nSustained anxiety, agitation or pain\nAny of the SBT failure criteria (see below)\n\n\nContraindications:\n\nindication for deep sedation (active seizures, alcohol withdrawal, ongoing agitation)\nneuromuscular blockade\nraised intracranial pressure (ICP)\nmyocardial infarct (MI) in the last 24 hours\n\n\nIf this was not tolerated, sedatives were restarted at half the previous rate and titrated back up.\n\n\nSpontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) if successful SAT, performed as per control group (described below)\n\nControl\n\nSpontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) if suitable each morning:\n\nProcess: breathing for 2 hours on any one of:\n\nPressure supported ventilation (PSV) of less than 7 cmH2O\nContinuous positive pressure ventilation (CPAP) of 5 cmH2O\nT-tube circuit\n\n\nCriteria for failure were:\n\nTachypnoea > 35/min or Bradypnoea < 8/min\nHypoxaemia SpO2 < 88%\nAcute mental status change\nAcute cardiac arrhythmia\nAny two signs of respiratory distress (tachycardia > 130 bpm; bradycardia < 60 bpm; accessory muscle use; abdominal paradoxical movement; diaphoresis; marked dyspnoea)\n\n\nContraindications:\n\nno spontaneous respiratory effort\ninadequate oxygenation (SpO2<88% or FiO2>0.5 or PEEP>8)\nraised ICP\nMI in previous 24 hours\nagitation\nsignificant vasopressors (Dop/Dob>5mcg/kg/min, NA>2mcg/min, vasopressin, milrinone)\n\n\nIf successful SBT, then clinicians had final decision regarding extubation\n\n\n\nBoth groups were sedated the same:\n\nPatient-targeted sedation to a \u201clevel of arousal and comfort deemed clinically appropriate for each patient\u201d\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: addition of SAT expedited weaning from mechanical ventilation\n\nIncrease in \u2018ventilator-free days\u2019 (mean days 14.7 [SD 0.0] v. 11.6 [0.9] p=0.02).\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nSignificantly faster discharge from ICU (median days 9.1 [IQR 5.1-17.8] v. 12.9 [6.0-24.2] p=0.01).\nSignificantly faster discharge from hospital (median days 14.9 [8.9-26.8] v. 19.2 [10.3 to (>25% not discharged by 28 days)] p=0.04).\nTrend towards reduced 28-day mortality (28% v. 35% p=0.21).\nSignificantly reduced 1-year mortality (44% v. 55% p=0.01).\nSignificantly reduced duration of coma RASS -4/-5 (median days 2 [0-4] v. 3 [1-7] p=0.002).\nNo difference in duration of delirium based on CAM-ICU score (median days 2 [0-5] v. 2 [0-6] p=0.5).\n\n\nComplications:\n\nSignificantly more frequent self-extubation (10% v. 4%. p=0.03).\nNot-significant reduction in frequency of tracheostomy (13% v. 20% p=0.06).\nNo difference in re-intubation rate (14% v. 13% p=0.73) even after self-extubation (3% v. 2% p=0.47)\nSubsequent analysis showed no long-term psychological of functional differences\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\u201c\u2026use of a so-called wake up and breathe protocol that pairs daily spontaneous awakening trials (ie, interruption of sedatives) with daily spontaneous breathing trials for the management of mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care results in better outcomes than current standard approaches and should become routine practice.\u201c\n\nStrengths\n\nAddresses a widely applicable topic\nPragmatic design\nEasy to replicate\nAppropriate randomisation\nSimilar baseline characteristics both demographically and clinically\nGood follow-up (99%)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPotential biases inherent in study design:\n\nSeveral eligible patients (a proportion of 324) were not enrolled due to physician refusal.\nThe performance of the study was necessarily unblinded and level of sedation and timing of extubation was at the clinicians discretion.\n\n\nComplicated statistical analysis including bootstrapping was employed due to the unusual distribution of the variable. These make interpretation of the study\u2019s findings more difficult.\nThe mechanism of the observed survival benefit is difficult to explain.\nRates of re-intubation (14% vs. 13%) and tracheostomy (13% vs. 20%) were high.\nGeneralisability:\n\nNo surgical patients were included due to their need for continuous analgesia.\nDoes the control group represent common practice? Modern practice targets lighter sedation than was common at the time.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe use of SATs during this trial appears to expedite weaning from mechanical ventilation, but the study findings may potentially reflect greater levels of oversedation in the control group or a bias towards early extubation in the intervention group. Their use may be associated with greater risk of self-extubation and increased nursing workload\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0Efficacy and safety of a paired sedation and ventilator weaning protocol for mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care (Awakening and Breathing Controlled trial): a randomised controlled trial by Girard et al\n[editorial]\u00a0Sedation in the intensive-care unit: good and bad? by Brochure\n[further reading] Sedation in ICU by Life in the Fast Lane\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Barnaby Dykes for the University Hospital Southampton GICU Journal Club (edited by @DuncanChambler)\nSummary date: 5th December 2014\nPeer-review editor: @stevemathieu75\n\n\n"
