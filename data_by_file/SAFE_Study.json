N Engl J Med 2004; 351:1905-1908.\nClinical Question\n\nDoes fluid resuscitation with albumin, compared to saline, affect mortality\u00a0for patients in the ICU?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nStratified by centre and according to whether there was a diagnosis of trauma\nDouble Blinded\n\nSetting\n\n16 ICUs in Australasia\nNovember 2001 \u2013 June 2003\n\nPopulation\n\nAdult patients admitted to academic tertiary ICUs who were judged to require fluid administration to maintain or increase intravascular volume\nExcluded post-op cardiac surgery, liver transplantation, burns\n6997 patients randomised\n\nIntervention\n\nResuscitation with 4% albumin\n\nControl\n\nResuscitation with 0.9% sodium chloride\n\nOutcome\n\nComparing 4% albumin to 0.9% sodium chloride\n\nPrimary outcome: all cause mortality at 28-days\n\n20.9% vs. 21.1%, Relative risk of death 0.99 (95% C.I. 0.91-1.09, P=0.87)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nThere was no difference in length of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation or renal replacement therapy\nMortality at 28 days in patients with severe sepsis\n\n30.7% vs 35.3% (RR 0.87, 95% C.I. 0.74 \u2013 1.02), P=0.09\n\n\nMortality at 28 days in patients with trauma\n\n13.6% vs. 10% (RR 1.36, 95% C.I 0.99 \u2013 1.86), P=0.06\n\n\n\n\nPost-hoc analysis: mortality at 28 days in patients with brain injury\n\n24.5% vs. 15.1% (RR 1.62, 95% C.I 1.12-2.34), P=0.009\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusion\n\nUse of 4% albumin or 0.9% sodium chloride for fluid resuscitation results in similar\u00a0 outcomes at 28 days\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre\nLarge number of patients included \u2013 a huge trial which demonstrates the importance of collaborative research\nDouble blinded \u2013 specifically designed fluid containers and administration sets were used\nRobustly defended the short term safety profile of 4% albumin after concerns were raised by the Cochrane Injuries Group Albumin Reviewers\n\nWeaknesses\n\nMinimal weaknesses. This was a great trial. The authors note that the sub-group analyses had insufficient power.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nOverall there is no difference when 4% albumin is used for fluid resuscitation when compared to 0.9% sodium chloride. 4% albumin should be avoided in head injuries. A\u00a0further study in patients with severe sepsis would\u00a0be beneficial \u2013 hence the ALBIOS study.\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf\u00a0/\u00a0abstract\u00a0/ DOI: 10.1056/NEJM200410283511818\nSaline or albumin for fluid resuscitation in patients with TBI.
