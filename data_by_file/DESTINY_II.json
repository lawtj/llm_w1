NEJM 2014;370:1091-1100. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1311367\nClinical Question\n\nIn older patients with malignant middle cerebral artery infarction does early hemicraniectomy, compared with standard care, improve survival without severe disability?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nRandomised via online tool\nNon-blinded\nIntention to treat analysis for primary outcome with per-protocol sensitivity analysis\nSample size calculation\n\nAssuming success rate of 8.6% in control group and 31% in hemicraniectomy group, 160 patients would give the study 90% power with a 5% false positive rate\n\n\nDesigned to stop recruitment as soon as harm, futility or efficacy was shown\n\nSetting\n\n13 hospitals in Germany\nAugust 2009 \u2013 May 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAge \u226561\nAcute unilateral middle-cerebral-artery (MCA) infarction with onset of symptoms within 48 hours\nNIHSS\u00a0score >14 in patients with infarction in non-dominant hemisphere, and >19 in patients with infarction in dominant hemisphere\nReduced level of consciousness on NIHSS scale\nIschaemic infarction of at least two thirds of MCA territory, including basal ganglia on brain imaging\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nPreexisting score of > 1 on the\u00a0Modified Rankin Scale\nPreexisting score of < 95 on the Barthel index of functional levels in activities of daily living\nAbsence of pupillary reflexes\nGCS < 6\nHaemorrhages or other associated brain lesions\nContraindications to surgery\nEstimated life expectancy of less than 3 years\n\n\n112 patients enrolled\n\nComparing intervention vs. control group, baseline characteristics\n\nAge 70 vs. 70\nPre-existing modified Rankin Score 0: 80% vs. 84%\nGCS 12 vs. 10\nNIHSS score 20 vs. 21\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nDecompressive hemicraniectomy within 48 hours of onset of symptoms\n\nDiameter of \u226512cm and duroplasty\n\n\n\nControl\n\nConservative treatment\n\nOptions included: admission to ICU, sedation, intubation + mechanical ventilation, osmotherapy\n\n\n\n1 patient from each group crossed over to other treatment option\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: score of 0-4 on\u00a0Modified Rankin Scale\u00a0at 6 months\n\n20/49 in hemicraniectomy group vs. 10/63 in control group\nBias-corrected, adjusted for the sequential nature of the trial\n\n38% vs. 18%, OR 2.91 (95% C.I. 1.06-7.49, P=0.04)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes at 12 months\n\nComparing hemicraniectomy vs. control\n\nSurvival 57% vs. 24%\n6% vs. 5% had mRs score of 3 at 12 months\n\n\n\n\n\nNo patient who survived had a score of 0-2 on modified Rankin scale\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nEarly hemicraniectomy significantly increased probability of survival in patients >60 years of age with malignant MCA infarction, but most survivors had substantial disability\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nMulti-centre\nClinical question specifically investigates older patients to compliment existing data on younger patients.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNon-blinded \u2013 not possible to blind treating physicians or patients. Assessors of primary outcome were not part of treatment team but not told of attempts to blind them to initial treatment e.g. asking patients/relatives to not tell them what treatment they had, wearing a hat during assessment\nTrial stopped early \u2018for reasons of efficacy,\u2019 Therefore small numbers of patients included in trial\nIt is not reported how many of the control group were admitted to ICU\nNot powered to detect improvements resulting in mild-moderate disability only\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn older patients with malignant MCA infarction an early decompressive hemicraniectomy significantly improves mortality but leaves the vast majority of survivors with moderately severe or severe disability. This therefore leaves us with the difficult question of whether this treatment should be offered or performed.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0Hemicraniectomy in Older Patients with Extensive Middle-Cerebral-Artery Stroke\n[Free Full Text]\u00a0Hemicraniectomy in Older Patients with Extensive Middle-Cerebral-Artery Stroke\n[Further Reading]\u00a0LITFL Decompressive hemicraniectomy for Malignant MCA infarction\n[Further Reading]\u00a0Bias corrected point estimates\n[Further Reading] Modified Rankin Scale\n[Further Reading]\u00a0NIHSS\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 28th May 2014\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n"
