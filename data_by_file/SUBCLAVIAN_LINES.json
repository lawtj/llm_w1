Anaesthesia 2022,77(1)59-65; doi.org/10.1111/anae.15525\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients undergoing elective neurosurgery, is a supraclavicular in-plane ultrasound guided approach, compared with an infra-clavicular out-of-plane ultrasound guided approach, non-inferior for catheterisation-related complication?\n\nBackground\n\nThe internal jugular, femoral and subclavian veins are commonly used for central venous lines\nThe use of subclavian lines is associated with a lower risk of infection but a higher risk of pneumothoraces\nSubclavian lines can be placed either supra or infra-clavicular. Previous single operator RCTs (1, 2) have demonstrated that for a single operator ,ultrasound guided supraclavicular approach was quicker, with similar success rates and fewer complications, compared with an infraclavicular approach\nWhen an infra-clavicular approach is used the use of the short axis out-of-plane ultrasound has been reported to have significant advantages over the use of long axis in-place ultrasound\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nNon-inferiority trial\nComputer generated random allocation sequence, 1:1 ratio\nUse of sealed opaque envelopes to maintain allocation concealment\nSample size calculation: 416 patients. With a false positive rate set at 5%, false negative rate set at 20%, and non-inferiority margin set at 5.9%, 416 patients required assuming a drop-out rate of 5%\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre, Seoul National University Hospital\nSeptember 2018 \u2013 May 2020\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAge 20-79\nRequired central venous catheterisation\nUndergoing elective general anaesthetic for neurosurgery\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nInfection or medical device at the puncture site\nRight subclavian venous thrombosis\nHaemostatic disorders or receiving anticoagulant\nPrevious history of surgery that might distort the anatomy of the right subclavian vein\n\n\n416 patients randomised. 8 patients excluded as not appropriately allocated, 4 withdrew consent, and 3 did not meet inclusion criteria, leaving 401 patients included in analysis\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nMale: 45% vs 49%\nAge: 53 vs 51 years\nBMI: 24 vs 25\nASA 1/2: 79% vs 80%\nASA 3: 17% vs 18%\nASA 4: 4% vs 2%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nSupra-clavicular approach\n\nLong-axis in-plane ultrasound\n\n\n\nControl\n\nInfra-clavicular approach\n\nshort-axis out-of-plane ultrasound\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll other peri-operative management was the same\nCentral line inserted after induction of general anaesthesia. Bed in flat position, with pillow removed and head, neck and arms in a neutral position\nVscanTM portable ultrasound machine\nOne of four anaesthetists who all had at least 10 successful cannulations with both approaches\nMechanical ventilation stopped prior to venous puncture, and re-started after successful catheterisation\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: proportion of patients with catheterisation-related complications, including catheter misplacement and mechanical complications (arterial puncture, haematoma formation, pneumothorax and haemothorax)\n\n3% in supra-clavicular vs 13.4% in infra-clavicular group\n\nMean difference -10.4% (95% CI -15.7 to -5.1%), OR 0.20 (95% CI 0.8-0.49), p<0.001\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nComparing intervention vs. control group\n\nNo significant difference in\n\nOverall success\n\n99.5% vs 99.5%\n\n\nSuccess at 1st attempt for catheterisation\n\n87% vs 88%\n\n\nTime required for catheterisation\n\n79 vs 78 seconds\n\n\nIncidence of mechanical complications\n\n2% vs 3%\n\n\nArterial puncture\n\n2% vs 1.5%\n\n\nPneumothorax\n\n0% vs 1%\n\n\nRescue ventilation\n\n14.5% vs 12.4%\n\n\n\n\nSignificantly less in supra-clavicular group\n\nCatheterisation related complication\n\n3% vs 13.4%\nMean difference -10.4 (95% CI -15.7 to -5.1%), OR 0.2 (0.08-0.49), p<0.001\n\n\nCatheter misplacements\n\n1% vs 10.4%\nMean difference -9.4 (95% CI -13.9 to -5), OR 0.09 (0.02-0.37), p<0.001\n\n\nCatheter misplacement into ipsilateral internal jugular vein 0.5% vs 8%\n\nMean difference -7.5 (95% CI -11.4 to -3.6%), OR 0.06 (0.01-0.44), p<0.001\n\n\nTime required for venous puncture\n\n9 vs 13 seconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe supraclavicular approach seems to be a better approach for ultrasound-guided right subclavian venous catheterisation\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nMulti-operator, all operators were experienced with both techniques\nAllocation concealment maintained\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe supraclavicular approach used an inplane ultrasound where as the infaclavicular approach used out-of plane ultrasound. Although i understand the reasons for this, this may be a confounding variable\nThis was a non-inferiority study and and was not designed to address superiority\nSingle centre study in South Korea\nOnly included patients who were mechanically ventilated and having elective neurosurgery. Results may not be generalisable to other settings\nBlinding of those inserting lines not possible\n3.6% of patients randomised not included in analysis\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn elective patients undergoing subclavian central line insertion, the use of a supra-clavicular approach with in-plane ultrasound was non-inferior to an infra-clavicular approach with out-of-plane ultrasound.\nThe success rates were similar for both approaches where as the rate of catheter related complications was significantly less with the supra-clavicular approach. This was predominately due to a reduction in catheter misplacement\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Supraclavicular versus infraclavicular approach for ultrasound-guided right subclavian venous catheterisation: a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial\n[further watching] How To: Supraclavicular Approach to Subclavian Vein Cannulation \u2013 SonoSite Ultrasound\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 14th Jan 2022\nPeer-review editor: @avkwong\nPicture by: [author/site]\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
