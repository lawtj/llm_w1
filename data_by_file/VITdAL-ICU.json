JAMA 2014; 312:1520-30. doi:10.1001/jama.2014.13204\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients with low serum vitamin D levels, does high-dose vitamin D supplementation compared with placebo reduce hospital length of stay?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\nComputerised randomisation in blocks of 8, stratified according to ICU type and sex\nFully blinded: patients, clinicians and assessors\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nPowered at 80% to detect a reduction in hospital stay by 2 days from a baseline of 14 days (standard deviation 7 days) with a significance level defined at 0.05\n\nAllowed for 5% drop-out rate\nRequired 490 patients\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nSingle-centre with five different ICUs: medical, neurological, cardiothoracic and two mixed-surgical\nBased in tertiary academic centre in Austria\nMay 2010 to March 2012\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: over 18 years, expected to stay in ICU for 48 hours or more, 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/ml (49.92 nmol/l)\nExclusion: gastrointestinal failure, pregnant or lactating women, hypercalcaemia (total calcium > 10.6 mg/dl [2.65 mmol/l] or ionised Ca2+ > 5.4 mg/dl [1.35 mmol/l]), diagnosis of TB, sarcoidosis or kidney stones in past year\n1140 assessed, 492 recruited and 475 included in analysis (12 did not receive assigned medication, 5 withdrew consent)\nBaseline characteristics (Placebo vs Vitamin D3)\n\nMean age in years: 65.3 vs 63.9\nEthnicity: 100% white vs 100% white\nBMI: 27.1 vs 27.2\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nVitamin D (Oleovit D3, Fresenius Kabi)\n\nLoading dose of 540,000 IU vitamin D in 45 ml oleum arachidis orally or via nasogastric tube\nMaintenance dose of 90,000 IU vitamin D in 7.5 ml oleum arachidis monthly from day 28 for five months\nStandard vitamin D supplementation of 200 IU per day could be given at physicians discretion\nPatients were requested to avoid other vitamin D supplements\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo (identical color, smell and taste)\n\nLoading dose of 45 ml oleum arachidis\nMaintenance dose 7.5 ml oleum arachidis monthly from day 28 for five months\nStandard vitamin D supplementation of 200 IU per day could be given at physicians discretion\nPatients were requested to avoid other vitamin D supplements\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: hospital length of stay was not statistically different between the groups (comparison as median days with interquartile range)\n\nVitamin D:\u00a020.1 days (11.1 to 33.3)\nPlacebo:\u00a019.3 days (11.1 to 34.9)\np value = 0.98\n\n\nSecondary outcome: there were no statistically different outcomes, but the trend favoured the vitamin D group (comparison is placebo vs vitamin D, hazard ratio with 95% confidence intervals and p-values)\n\nICU length of stay: 10.7 days vs 9.6 days; p=0.38\nICU mortality: 26.5 vs 22.8; HR 0.97 (0.67\u20131.39); p=0.86\n28-day mortality: 28.6 vs 21.9; HR 0.76 (0.53\u20131.09); p=0.14\nHospital mortality: 35.3 vs 28.3; HR 0.81 (0.58\u20131.11); p=0.18\n6-month mortality: 42.9 vs 35.0; HR 0.78 (0.58\u20131.04); p=0.09\n\n\nSubgroup analysis: in the subgroup of severe vitamin D deficiency (\u226412 ng/ml), both the effect size and point accuracy increased, with statistical significant benefit of vitamin D at 28-day, hospital and 6-month mortality.\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\u201cAmong patients with vitamin D deficiency who are critically ill, administration of high-dose vitamin D3 compared with placebo did not improve hospital length of stay, hospital mortality, or 6-month mortality\u201d\n\nStrengths\n\nWell designed, randomised, controlled trial with appropriate concealment, blinding and statistical analysis \u2013 strong internal validity\nFull recruitment for planned statistical power, with no loss-to-follow-up and minimal withdrawal\nMixed ICU population\n\nWeaknesses\n\nChoice of primary outcome (length of stay) is less relevant than mortality, but the authors justify this weakness: no pilot data available to base power calculation on\nStrong emphasis on subgroup outcomes, but authors suggest this should be hypothesis generating and not conclusive evidence\nNo representation of non-white, non-adult populations limiting external validity\nSmall sample size may not allow detection of rare but significant side effects\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis well designed trial suggests that severe vitamin D deficiency in critically ill patients may benefit from high-dose supplementation, but as a single-centre and relatively small trial the findings need to be validated by further trials before a treatment recommendation can be made\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0VITdAL-ICU: Effect of High-Dose Vitamin D3 on Hospital Length of Stay in Critically Ill Patients with Vitamin D Deficiency\n[podcast] Interview with Karin Amrein (trial author) by Intensive Care Network\n[further reading]\u00a0Vitamin D in Critical Care by LITFL\n[blog] Conference notes from Critical Care Reviews 2015, including presentation of this study by Karin Amrein\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 28 January 2015\nPeer-review editor: @stevemathieu75\n\n\n\n"
