NEJM 2012; 367:1901-11. doi:10.1056/NEJMoal209759\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients requiring fluid resuscitation, does 6% hydroxyethyl starch (6% HES) compared to 0.9% sodium chloride (Saline) reduce mortality at 90 days?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled, double-blinded clinical trial\nComputer generated randomisation via website providing complete concealment\nMinimisation algorithm stratified by institution and admission diagnosis of trauma\nA priori publication of trial protocol and statistical analysis plan\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nPowered at 90% to detect absolute difference of 3.5% difference in mortality at 90 days from baseline of 26%, with alpha significance of 0.05\n\nPlanned sample size of 7000, allowing 5% loss\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n32 adult ICUs\nMixed medical and surgical\nAustralia and New Zealand\nDecember 2009 to January 2012\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Attending physician judged fluid resuscitation to be needed; age over 18 years\nExclusion: 1000ml or more 6% HES prior to ICU admission; impending or current renal replacement therapy; intracranial haemorrhage; women of child-bearing age unless known negative pregnancy state; cardiac surgery, burn injury or liver transplant.\n19,475 patients screened; 7000 randomised\n\nBaseline characteristics were similar (6% HES vs Saline):\n\nAge: 63.1 vs 62.9 years\nWeight: 79.4 vs 78.6 kg\nAdmitted from ED: 27.7% vs 27.6%\nAPACHE 2 score: 17.0 vs 17.0\nSepsis diagnosis: 29.2 vs 28.4\nRIFLE-injury at baseline: 36.0% vs 36.0%\n6% HES prior to randomisation: 15.2% vs 15.1%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n6% HES (Voluven, Fresenius Kabi as 500ml bags)\n\nControl\n\n0.9% Saline (identical 500ml bags)\n\nBoth groups managed as below:\n\nFluid administered at clinician\u2019s discretion for all fluid resuscitation\n\nTo correct hypovolaemia\nSupported by at least one objective physiological parameter\n\n\nContinued until death, discharge or day-90\nLimited at 50 ml/kg/day as per product license\n\nOpen-label saline as required after this limit\n\n\nChange to open-label saline if renal replacement therapy required\nMaintenance and replacement fluid not controlled; fluid outside of ICU not controlled\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: there was no statistically significant difference in 90-day mortality between the two groups\n\n6% HES: 18.0%\nSaline: 17.0%\nAbsolute risk increase: 1.0%\nRelative risk: 1.06 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.18; p=0.26)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: comparisons are 6% HES vs Saline\n\nIncidence of acute kidney injury (by RIFLE scoring): reduced risk and injury, but more failure associated with 6% HES (see table).\n\n6% HES associated with increased urine output but also increased serum creatinine\n\n\nRenal replacement therapy use: 7.0% vs 5.8% (RR 1.21; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.45; p=0.04) favouring Saline\nNew organ failure (by SOFA scoring): less cardiovascular failure but more hepatic failure associated with 6% HES (see table)\nDuration of mechanical ventilation: 6.0 vs 5.7 days (p=0.12)\nDuration of renal replacement therapy: 5.6 vs 5.5 days (p=0.86)\nCause-specific mortality: no statistically significant differences (see table)\n\n\nTertiary outcomes:\n\nFluid administered during first 4 days: 6% HES group received significantly less fluid\n\n6% HES: 526 ml/day \u00b1 425 ml/day (as mean \u00b1 SD)\nSaline: 616 ml/day \u00b1 488 ml/day\np<0.001\n\n\nBlood products: 6% HES group received significantly more blood products\n\n6% HES: 78 ml \u00b1 250 ml\nSaline: 60 \u00b1 190 ml\np<0.001\n\n\nHaemodynamic parameters were not significantly different\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\u201cOur study does not provide evidence that resuscitation with 6% HES (130/0.4) as compared with saline, in the ICU provides any clinical benefit to the patient. Indeed the use of HES resulted in an increased rate of renal replacement therapy.\u201d\n\nStrengths\n\nWell designed, large, multi-centre randomised, controlled trial\nBiases minimised with double-blinding\nPragmatic design \u2013 administration at clinician\u2019s discretion\nA priori statistical plan and intention-to-treat analysis\n\nWeaknesses\n\n6% HES had been administered to 15% of patients in Saline group prior to randomisation. This small cross-over may bias towards a conclusion of \u2018no difference\u2019\n5% loss to follow-up \u2013 this is what the authors expected, and since it is less than the primary outcome rate, it is unlikely to change the conclusion either way.\nThe lower baseline mortality rate may have contributed to a false negative conclusion\nThe clinician-judged need for renal replacement therapy has been criticised by some, but given clinicians were blinded, this is unlikely to have biased the conclusion\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial adds to the existing data: starch-based fluids do not provide a mortality benefit and lead to increased renal dysfunction requiring renal replacement therapy.\nIn the context of critically ill medical and surgical patients, starch-based fluids should not be used for volume resuscitation.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Hydroxyethyl Starch or Saline for Fluid Resuscitation in Intensive Care by Myburgh et al\n[commentary] Crystalloids vs Colloids by Phillips et al\n[commentary]\u00a0Starch in Sepsis from ESICM\n[further reading] Hydroxyethyl-starch solutions (HES) should no longer be used in patients with sepsis or burn injuries or in critically ill patients\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 13 January 2015\nPeer-review editor: @DavidSlessor\n\n\n\n"
