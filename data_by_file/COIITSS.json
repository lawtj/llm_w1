JAMA 2010; 303(4): 341-348. doi:10.1001/jama.2010.2\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with septic shock who are treated with corticosteroids, does tight glycaemic control (4.44\u20136.1 mmol/l) compared with less-tight glycaemic control (<8.3 mmol/l) reduce in-hospital mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nSeptic shock is a characterised by a dysregulated host response to an infection including hypotension that is not corrected by fluid administration alone\nThe administration of corticosteroids (hydrocortisone in particular) is thought to attenuate this response and evidence suggests that it reduces the degree of hypotension although it may not ultimately prevent death\nA consequence of corticosteroid administration is dysregulation of glucose control, which may be harmful\nIt is possible that intensive insulin therapy, with the aim of tight serum glucose control within normal physiological parameters, may counteract some of the harm from corticosteroids allowing them to be more beneficial in patients with septic shock\nThis trial also investigated the effect of additional fludrocortisone as a secondary outcome as the interaction between glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids had not been adequately studied in patients with septic shock\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\nMulticentre\n2\u00d72 factorial design generating 4 groups of patients\n\nArm 1: intensive insulin therapy vs conventional glucose control\nArm 2: fludrocortisone vs no-fludrocortisone\n\n\nOpen-label\n\nPatients, clinical staff and research staff were aware of allocation\nNo attempt to blind participants or staff\nNo placebo therapy was used\n\n\nCentralised web-based randomisation process with permutation blocks of variable size to conceal allocation prior to recruitment and randomisation\nHydrocortisone and other non-study therapies were standardised and controlled in keeping with 2004 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidance\nIntention to treat analysis\nPower calculation based only on Arm 1: intensive insulin therapy vs conventional glucose control\n\nEstimated 50% in-hospital mortality in control group\nExpected absolute reduction of 12.5% (25% relative reduction in mortality)\n\nThis can be compared to the 32% relative reduction found in\u00a0Van den Berghe\u2019s intensive insulin trial)\n\n\nStatistics based upon \u03b1 = 0.05 and Power (1-\u03b2) = 80%\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n11 Intensive Care Units across France\nJanuary 2006 to January 2009\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdults who met the criteria (ACCP/SCCM 1992) for severe sepsis\nSOFA score \u2265 8\nRequirement for vasopressors / inotropes to maintain systolic BP > 90 mmHg or mean BP > 60 mmHg\nReceiving hydrocortisone 50mg IV every 6 hours\n\n\nExclusion: pregnancy;
