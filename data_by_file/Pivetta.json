Eur J Heart Failure 2019, doi:10.1002/ejhf.1379\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute dyspnoea, does the addition of lung ultrasound examination compared to standard approach, improve the diagnostic accuracy for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF)?\n\nBackground\n\nPoint-of-care ultrasound, including lung ultrasound, has become increasingly part of the armament of healthcare professionals assessing the critically unwell patient, despite the lack of evidence showing mortality benefit (link)\nEarly studies have focussed on the accuracy of lung ultrasound compared to more traditional imaging modalities, such as chest radiographs (link), in identifying pathology\nThere has not been any randomised controlled trial comparing the use of lung ultrasound in the diagnosis of acute heart failure compared to standard clinical approach\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, multicentre, parallel group\nComputer permuted block randomisation\nPatient randomised after initial clinical evaluation and the physician had categorised the working diagnosis as either ADHF or non-ADHF\n1:1 to lung ultrasound group (LUS) or chest radiograph and NT-proBNP levels (CXR/NT-proBNP)\nFollowing this, this initial integrated diagnosis was recorded\nAll patients in the LUS group would still undergo a CXR and NT-proBNP\r\n\nSimilarly the CXR/NT-proBNP group could undergo LUS at the request of the physician\nThe results of these subsequent tests could have potentially changed the physician\u2019s final diagnosis and management\n\n\n\u00a0After hospital discharge or death, 2 experts blinded to LUS results, reviewed all notes and investigations and adjudicated diagnosis of ADHF based on 2012 guidelines from European Society of Cardiology\n258 patients needed in each arm to detect 10% difference in sensitivity\r\n\n80% power and a 5% alpha error\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n2 Italian academic centres\nEnrolment occurred between January 2014 to March 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\r\n\nAdult patients (> 18 years)\nPresented to the ED with acute dyspnoea (sudden onset of shortness of breath or increase in the severity of chronic dyspnoea in the previous 48 hours)\nPresence of emergency physician with expertise in lung ultrasonography\n\n\nExclusion: \n\nAlready commenced on positive pressure ventilation (invasive and non-invasive)\nAcute dyspnoea in the context of trauma\n\n\n532 eligible, 518 enrolled (411 from a single centre)\r\n\n12 no consent, 2 didn\u2019t have dyspnoea as main symptom\n\n\nMedian age 79; 53% men\r\n\n25.5% of patients admitted to ICU after ED evaluation\n\n\n\nLUS group\n\nLUS performed by a certified practitioner\r\n\nCurvilinear probe, standard 8 zone protocol\nPresence of B lines and pleural effusions recorded\n\n\n\nCXR/NT-proBNP\n\nCXR and NT-proBNP performed after initial clinical evaluation\nLUS could be performed at the request of the physician but only after the CXR/NT-proBNP-implemented diagnosis was recorded\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nClinical evaluation [including past medical history, history of present illness, physical examination, arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) and ECG]\nThe physician was responsible for therapeutic decisions\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: LUS group had greater accuracy in the diagnosis of ADHF compared to CXR/NT-proBNP group\r\n\n224 patients (43.2%) identified with ADHF by experts (Kappa agreement between 2 experts 0.84; 95%CI 0.79-0.88); ADHF incidence of 48.1% in LUS and 38.5% in CXR/NT-proBNP\r\n\nAUC LUS vs clinical evaluation alone: 94.5 vs 88 (p<0.01)\nAUC CXR/NT-proBNP vs clinical evaluation alone: 87.2 vs 85 (p>0.05)\nSensitivity: LUS 93.5, CXR/NT-proBNP 85\nSpecificity: LUS 95.5, CXR/NT-proBNP 89.4\nPositive predictive value:\u00a0LUS 95.1, CXR/NT-proBNP 83.3\nNegative predictive value:\u00a0LUS 94.1, CXR/NT-proBNP 90.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIntegration of LUS with clinical assessment for the diagnosis of ADHF in the emergency department seems to be more accurate than the current diagnostic approach based on CXR and NT-proBNP\n\nStrengths\n\nMulticentre\nAppropriately powered\r\n\nActual sensitivity of LUS in diagnosing ADHF in trial was as used for power calculation\n\n\nClinical evaluation in study design is reflective of real life practice\n\nWeaknesses\n\nA single centre recruited nearly 80% of total subjects\n25% of patients in study admitted to ICU; such a sick population may not be generalisable\nThe gold standard for the diagnosis of ADHF in this study is based on judgement by individual experts\nGreater incidence of ADHF in the LUS group- this is commented on by the authors in their discussion; it is difficult to tell whether this was a clinically relevant finding, a demonstration of the increased sensitivity of LUS, or due to chance\nBoth ADHF and non-ADHF causes of dyspnoea could co-exist in the same patient; physicians were asked (and subsequent analysis was based on) single main diagnosis\nConvenience sampling as recruitment required the presence of a physician who could perform LUS\nNo echocardiography examination data was included in the analysis; presumably zone 2 of LUS would have some view of the heart\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe addition of LUS to clinical evaluation improved the diagnostic accuracy of ADHF whereas the addition of CXR and NT-proBNP did not. NT-proBNP is not routinely used in my practice and this paper would support this. My current practice is to evaluate patients who present with acute dyspnoea with ultrasound examination of the lung AND heart \u2013 I will continue to do so.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Lung ultrasound integrated with clinical assessment for the diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure in the emergency department: a randomized controlled trial\n\n\n[further reading]\u00a0Lung ultrasound in the critically ill\n[further reading]\u00a0Pulmonary Ultrasound in Patients with Heart Failure \u2013 Systematic Review\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Adrian Wong\u00a0Summary date: 7th February 2019Peer-review editor: Segun Olusanya\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
