Conclusions\n\nIn critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury, an early compared with a delayed initiation of renal\u00a0replacement therapy showed no difference in mortality.\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nMulti-centre\nAdequately powered\nDefined criteria for initiation of RRT\n\nWeaknesses\n\nFor over 50% of patients the initial modality\u00a0of RRT was intermittent RRT. This was despite the fact that 85% of patients required vasopressor support upon initiation of RRT. This may limit the external validity as this is not standard practice in the UK.\nA limitation that the authors state is that the study only included patients with\u00a0advanced kidney injury, and therefore the results may not be generalisable to patients\u00a0with\u00a0less severe kidney injuries.\nNon-blinded \u2013 although unavoidable the unblinded clinician also directed care which may introduce bias.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury, an early approach to RRT\u00a0did not provide a mortality benefit compared to a delayed approach; when the RRT modality was predominately\u00a0intermittent RRT.\n~50% of the patients in the delayed group did not receive RRT\nThere was a significantly higher rate of catheter related nosocmial infections in the early group\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Initiation Strategies for Renal-Replacement Therapy in the Intensive Care Unit\n[Editorial]\u00a0Renal-Replacement Therapy in the Critically Ill \u2014 Does Timing Matter?\n[ongoing studies]\u00a0Study protocol for Impact on mortality of the timing of renal replacement therapy in patients with severe acute kidney injury in septic shock: the IDEAL-ICU study\n[Editorial]\u00a0Renal-Replacement Therapy in the Critically Ill \u2014 Does Timing Matter?\n[further reading]\u00a0Effect of Early vs Delayed Initiation of Renal Replacement Therapy on Mortality in Critically Ill Patients With Acute Kidney Injury The ELAIN Randomized Clinical Trial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date:\u00a001.06.16.\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n"
