However in the suspected hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) subgroup it showed possible benefit from conservative oxygen therapy (decreased 180 day mortality and increased number of ventilator free days). However this could have been accounted for by chance baseline imbalances or other confounding factors that may affect outcomes in patients who have suffered a cardiac arrest\nThis study aims to address the potential benefit in receiving conservative oxygen therapy that the ICU-ROX study has identified\nBy identifying if a conservative approach to oxygen therapy can improve survival or neurological outcome this would have a huge impact on patient care\n\nDesign\n\nThis study is a post hoc analysis of data from ICU-ROX study\nThe ICU-ROX study was a single blinded randomised multi centre trial\nThe suspected Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy (HIE) subgroup identified pre randomisation\nTo qualify for the suspected HIE subgroup: Either HIE diagnosis documented in notes, or all post cardiac arrest patients unless there was documentation that the patient was following commands after ROSC was achieved, after the cardiac arrest and prior to being sedated\nData collected in addition to the ICU-ROX study:\n\nDetails of cardiac arrest (location, if witnessed, bystander response, cause, 1st rhythm, time until ROSC)\nPatient comorbidities\nAny neuroprognostic tests performed\nIf TTM was used\nDrugs used in resus\n\n\nIntention to treat analysis (excluding patients that withdrew consent)\n\nSetting\n\n21 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand\nData collected between September 2015 and May 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nAs per the ICU-ROX study\nInclusion: Mechanically ventilated adults (>17 years old), expected to remain ventilated for at least one day after starting the trial; within 2 hours of mechanical ventilation or non-invasive ventilation in an ICU\nExclusion: Hyperoxia either indicated or avoidance of hyperoxia indicated, pregnancy, long term ventilated patients, death inevitable\n1000 patients enrolled in ICU-ROX study\n166 patients in suspected HIE subgroup\n79 patients randomised to control group of which 7 lost to follow up, therefore 72 patients included in study\n87 patients randomised to conservative oxygen therapy group of which 9 lost to follow up therefore 78 patients included in study\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nMajority of baseline demographics well balanced\nSignificant difference in response time following cardiac arrest between the groups. However, no significant difference in the time to receive defibrillation or time to sustained ROSC\nConservative vs usual oxygen therapy\nMean age: 62 vs 61, p=0.49\nMale: 76% vs 79%, p=0.69\nComorbidities\n\nHypertension: 38% vs. 30%, p=0.31\nDiabetes: 28% vs 23%, p=0.48\nIschaemic heart disease: 21% vs 29%, p=0.21\nAsthma/COPD: 20% vs 19%, p=0.93\nPrevious MI: 12% vs 20%, p=0.12\nPrevious cardiac arrhythmia: 16% vs. 10%, p=0.26\n\n\nCardiac arrest location\n\nEmergency Department: 3% vs 8%, p=0.24\nHome/residence: 38% vs 40%, p=0.73\nOther location (not in hospital): 49% vs 41%, p=0.25\n\n\nWitnessed arrest: 83% vs 77%, p=0.37\nBystander response: 75% vs 71%, p=0.58\nFirst monitored rhythm VF/VT: 67% vs 58%, p=0.26\nMean response time: 7.3 vs 5.0 mins, p=0.01\nMean time to defibrillation: 9.7 vs 9.0min, p=0.56\nMean time until sustained ROSC: 27 vs 25min, p=0.26\nPresence of STEMI: 27% vs 38%, p=0.14\n\n\nPost randomisation oxygen therapy:\n\n\u00a0Proportion of hours patient\u2019s oxygen saturations >96%: 0.39 vs 0.53, p=0.001\n\u00a0Proportion of hours patients were receiving an Fi02 of 0.21: 0.37 vs 0, p<0.0001\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n\u00a0Conservative oxygen therapy\n\nAim for oxygen sats 91-96%\nHigh sats alarm (>96%) was treated as an emergency and oxygen titrated down by 5% every 10 minutes\n\n\n\nControl\n\nUsual oxygen therapy\n\nAllow any oxygen sats >90%, no upper limit (not aiming for hyperoxaemia)\nNo specific measures limited FiO2 or SpO2, upper alarm limits for SpO2 prohibited and FiO2 <0.3 was discouraged\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nMonitored lower limit alarm for SpO2 was set at 90%, but could change if clinically indicated\nIf ABG demonstrated PaO2 <60mmHg or unacceptably low SaO2 the FiO2 could be increased, regardless of the SpO2\nPatient\u2019s received prescribed oxygen therapy until discharge from ICU or 28 days post randomisation, whichever came first\nAll other ICU management of both groups left at discretion of clinicians\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Death or survival with an unfavourable neurological outcome at 180 days \u2013 no significant difference\n\nUnfavourable neurological outcome = Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) category 1-4\n\n\n55.5% of the conservative oxygen therapy group died or had an unfavourable neurological outcome at day 180 vs 68.1% of the usual oxygen therapy group\n\nOR 0.58, CI 0.3-1.12, p=0.14\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nDay 180 mortality\n\nUnadjusted mortality \u2013 significantly reduced in intervention group\n\n43% vs 59%, OR 0.53 (95% CI 0.28-0.98), p=0.04\n\n\nAdjusted mortality \u2013 no significant difference\n\nAdjusted OR 0.56 (95% CI 0.25-1.23), p=0.15\n\n\n\n\nNo significant difference in ICU and hospital mortality\nNo significant difference in cause specific mortality, for both groups most common cause of death was brain damage\nNo significant difference in ICU or hospital length of stay\nSignificantly more ventilator free days in conservative oxygen therapy group\n\nMedian 23 days vs 0 days in usual oxygen therapy group\n\n\nSignificantly more vasopressor free days in conservative oxygen therapy group\n\nMedian 21 days vs 0 days in usual oxygen therapy group\n\n\nNo difference in duration of ventilation among patients who survived over 28 days was demonstrated, suggesting that although the median number of ventilator free days was significantly higher in the conservative oxygen group, those who had less ventilator free days needed much longer time on a ventilator\n\n\nPost-hoc outcomes:\n\nAlthough not a specified secondary outcome the study reported that when neurological outcome was analysed across the whole GOS-E scale (rather than just a score of 1-4 considered as unfavourable), the median GOS-E score was significantly better with conservative oxygen therapy. However the 95% CI was wide\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nConservative oxygen therapy was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in death or unfavourable neurological outcome at day 180 compared with usual oxygen therapy\nStatistically significant increases in number of ventilator and vasopressor free days in patients in conservative oxygen therapy group. However it is important to recognise that ventilator/vasopressor free days are also a reflection of mortality and the fact that the date is not normally distributed. All deaths had zero ventilator/vasopressor free days and therefore if the mortality if over 50%, the median number of ventilator/vasopressor free days must be 0. If mortality is less than 50%, the median number of free days can be much higher. Therefore the magnitude of difference demonstrated (21.1 vs 0) is less dramatic than it initially appears\n\nStrengths\n\nBaseline demographics were well balanced\nThis study includes the largest sample of patients in which oxygen therapy has been evaluated in HIE in a randomised clinical trial\nThe data can be used to help deign future trials in order to do power calculations for sample size\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThis is a post hoc analysis so can only be used for hypothesis generating\nNumbers in both groups were small (78 & 72 patients) so was always going to be difficult to prove significant differences. 10% of patients lost to follow up and primary outcome status not available\nMany variables that can influence outcome after cardiac arrest were not measured, eg number of shocks, airway control used, whether mechanical compression devices were used\nThere was low use of neuroprognostic tests\nNo information was collected to demonstrate oxygen delivery eg lactate, central venous oxygen sats\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAlthough this study doesn\u2019t manage to answer the key question of what is the optimum oxygen therapy for post cardiac arrest patients, it builds on the ICU-ROX study and sets the ground work for future work. There are exciting studies lined up for the future:\n\nThe NIHR HTA funded study to further evaluate conservative oxygen therapy in mechanically ventilated adults in the UK aims to recruit 16,500 patients, starting from 2021\nMegaROX is an ANZICS CTG endorsed study which will enrol 40,000 participants across multiple countries, further comparing conservative vs liberal oxygen targets. It will be a series of multicentre, randomised, parallel-group, registry-embedded clinical trials. Within this will be the nested 6800 patient MegaROX HIE study focusing on patients with hypoxic iscahemic encephalopathy\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Conservative oxygen therapy for mechanically ventilated adults with suspected hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy\n[further listening] MEGAROX trial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Sarah Nelson\nSummary date: date 11th March 2021\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\nImage by: fernando zhiminaicela from Pixabay \n\u00a0\n\n\n"
