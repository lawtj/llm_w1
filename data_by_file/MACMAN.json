JAMA 2017; 317(5): 483-403. don: 10.1001/jama.2016.20603\nClinical Question\n\nIn intensive care patients requiring orotracheal intubation, does video laryngoscopy (VL)\u00a0compared to the Macintosh direct laryngoscope (DL) increase the frequency of first pass intubation?\n\nDesign\n\nNon-blinded, multicentre, open-label, 2 parallel group RCT\nRandomisation in blocks of 4, balanced and stratified by centre and experience of intubators (\u201cexperts\u201d vs \u201cnon-experts\u201d)\n\n\u201cExperts\u201d \u2013 5 years of ICU experience OR 1 year of ICU and 2 years of anaesthesia experience.\n\u201cNon-expert\u201d \u2013 All others\n\n\nRandomisation sequence generated by blinded statistician\nComputerised allocation provided full concealment\nBoth intention to treat and per protocol analyses performed\nMissing data was considered a failed first pass intubation\n370 participants planned, assuming first pass success rate of 65% with DL, increased to 80% with VL, type I error of 5%, and type II error of 10%\n\nSetting\n\n7 ICUs in France\nMay\u00a0\u2013\u00a0December 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nICU admission and need for orotracheal intubation to facilitate \u00a0mechanical ventilation\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nContraindications to oral intubation, e.g. unstable C-spine\nInsufficient time to include and randomise, e.g. cardiac arrest\nAge <18\nPregnant or breastfeeding\nCorrectional facility inmate\nUnder guardianship\nWithout health insurance\nRefusal by patient or next of kin\nPrevious enrolment in an RCT with intubation as the primary end point\n\n\n489 patients screened, 371 randomised\n\n186 randomised to VL, 185 randomised to DL \u00a0(ITT analysis)\n183 received VL as intended, 182 received DL as intended (per protocol analysis)\n\n\nBaseline statistics similar between groups\n\nIntervention\n\nMcGrath MAC Videolaryngoscope (without stylet)\n\nControl\n\nMacintosh direct laryngoscope with either a 3 or 4 blade\n\nStandard to both groups:\n\nAll physicians in all centres were trained in the use of all equipment on mannequins before starting the studyI\u00a0All \u201cnon-experts\u201d were supervised by an \u201cexpert\u201d during the study\nPreoxygenation with device of the intensivist\u2019s choosing\n\nNon-rebreathe mask of at least 15L/min for >3 mins\nNIV with 100% oxygen for at least 3 mins\nHigh flow nasal cannula oxygen at 60L/min with 100% oxygen for at least 3 mins\n\n\nIV induction with EITHER etomidate 0.2/0.3mg/kg OR ketamine 1-2mg/kg\nMuscle relaxation with suxamethonium 1mg/kg OR rocuronium 1mg/kg (if sugammadex immediately available)\nCricoid pressure was at user\u2019s discretion\nIf first pass failed, individual was allowed to choose between repeat laryngoscopy or alternative device as per French difficult airway guidelines\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Successful first pass intubation, as defined by capnography over 4 breaths or more \u2013 no significant

glottic opening score, comparing VL with DL\nChart of reason for intubation failure, comparing VL with DL\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmongst patients in ICU requiring intubation, video laryngoscopy compared with direct laryngoscopy did not improve first pass orotracheal intubation rates and was associated with higher rates of severe life-threatening complications\n\nStrengths\n\nImportant clinical question\nAccurate power calculation\nAppropriate methodology with good efforts to minimise bias, such as concealed allocation, maintenance of intended intervention and intention-to-treat analysis\nObjective, patient centred primary outcome\nRegistered with clinicaltrials.gov\nAll users were familiar with the devices, improving internal validity\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe intubation protocol allowed for some user variability \u2013 this could affect both internal and external validity\nSuxamethonium 1mg/kg was used in the vast majority of intubations \u2013 some would debate this would not give optimal conditions for intubation (1.5mg/kg may be better (Naguib et al, 2006)\nEtomidate/sux were used in the vast majority (75-80%) of intubations \u2013 this is not\u00a0 common practice worldwide and reduces external validity\nThe McGrath is one of many video laryngoscopes\n\nThis trial is really a comparison of the McGrath and the Macintosh, and not a global view of VL versus DL\nIn a unit where the McGrath is not the video laryngoscope of choice, I would question the applicability of these results\n\n\nThe glottic view was significantly improved with the McGrath, however the intubation success was the same \u2013 there may have been an issue with technique or training\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn this trial comparing the McGrath VL and the Macintosh DL in intubating intensive care patients, there was no difference seen in the primary outcome of first pass success rate\nAn association was seen with improved glottic view, and with a worsening of severe complications \u2013 however these are secondary outcomes that the study is not powered for and thus hypothesis generating only (and this is clearly stated by the authors in the paper)\nI will focus on gaining expertise with my local devices and protocols, and encouraging my team members to do the same\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Lascarrou JB et al.
