JAMA 2018. Published online October 24, 2018. doi:10.1001/jama.2018.14280\nClinical Question\n\nIn mechanically ventilated patients without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), does a low tidal volume ventilation strategy (6mL/Kg), compared to intermediate tidal volume strategy (10mL/Kg), reduce the number of ventilator-free and alive days at day 28?\n\nBackground\n\nCurrent international guidelines recommend using low tidal volumes (<6-8 mLs/Kg) during mechanical ventilation of patients with ARDS (1)\nIt is less certain whether tidal volume restriction benefits patients without ARDS\nThis population of ventilated non ARDS patients is important to study (2) as:\n\nIt is many times larger than ARDS patients\nIt has been excluded from ARDS trials\n\n\nTwo previous studies have suggested benefit of a lower tidal volume strategy in non ARDS patients, and an individual patient data meta-analysis (3) suggests that a lower tidal volume may shorten the time spent on the ventilator and duration ICU stay\nHowever lower tidal volumes could also lead to greater patient- ventilator dysnchrony, higher sedation requirements, and prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation\n\nDesign\n\nA phase 3, randomised, clinical trial\nPatients were randomised to a low or intermediate tidal volume strategy in a 1:1 ratio, via an automated, web based system, with concealed allocation\nRandomization was done in random block sizes of 2-6 patients, and stratified for center and intubation location (inside or outside of ICU)\nFor 80% statistical power to detect a difference of 1 ventilator-free day at day 28 (with an estimated SD of 5 days), a sample size of 952 patients was required (476 per group)\nPrimary outcome: ventilator-free days and alive at day 28, defined as the number of days that a patient was alive and free from invasive ventilation at day 28 post randomisation\n\nSetting\n\n6 university and non university intensive care units in the Netherlands\nSeptember 2014-August 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adult ICU patients (over 18 years of age), who received invasive ventilation shortly before or after admission to the ICU and who were expected not to be extubated within 24 hours of randomization. They were randomized within 1 hour of initiation of ventilation in the ICU\nExclusion: The presence of ARDS (according to the criteria of the Berlin definition), age younger than 18 years; pregnancy; ventilation lasting longer than 12 hours before admission to the ICU; increased and uncontrollable intracranial pressure; history of pulmonary disease; new pulmonary thromboembolism; and previously randomized in this trial\n\n3695 patients were screened. 2734 were not enrolled\n\n961 (35.1%) ineligible (met exclusion criteria)\n1773 (64.9%) eligible but not enrolled\n\n705 missed\n348 Enrolled in other study\n296 No written deferred consent obtained\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n961 met criteria for randomisation\n\n\n\n\nBaseline characteristics were similar between low and intermediate tidal volume strategy\n\nMedian age 68 vs 67 years old\nSOFA score 8 (6-11) vs 8 (6-10)\nMedical reason for admission 82.7% vs 83.6%\nReason for intubation\n\nCardiac arrest 23.1% vs 24.8%\nPost-operative ventilation 17.2% vs 16.3%\nPneumonia 16.1% vs 15.9%\nSepsis 10.5% vs 9.5%\n\n\nMedian time between start of ventilation in ICU and randomization was 0.57 hours (0.23-1.00)\n\n\n\nLow Tidal Volume Strategy\n\nPatients were initiated with tidal volume of 6ml/Kg predicted body weight\n\nEither volume controlled or pressure support modes\nIf volume controlled, tidal volume was decreased by 1mL/Kg every hour to a minimum of 4mL/Kg\nIf pressure support, the minimum pressure was 5cm H2O\n\nIf tidal volume increased to >8mL/Kg PBW despite 5cm H2O , this was accepted\n\n\nIn cases of severe dyspnea, increasing levels of discomfort with or without the need for more sedation, a respiratory rate higher than 35/min, uncontrollable acidosis, or patient-ventilator asynchrony, tidal volume could be increased in increments of 1 mL/kg PBW per hour in patients receiving volume-controlled or pressure support ventilation\n\n\n\nIntermediate Tidal Volume Strategy\n\nPatients were initiated with a tidal volume of 10mL/Kg PBW\n\nIn volume controlled mode, if plateau pressure >25ch H2O, tidal volume was decreased by 1mL/Kg PBW per hour\nIn pressure support mode, pressure support level was adjusted to reach the target tidal volume while keeping the maximum airway pressure less than 25 cm H2O\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nUse of analgosedation or muscle relaxants, with the purpose of allowing the assigned ventilation strategy, was not permitted\nPBW was calculated using the following equations: 50 + 0.91 \u00d7 (height [cm] \u22124) for men and 45.5 + 0.91 \u00d7 (height [cm] \u2212 152.4) for women\nThe assigned ventilation strategies were continued for a maximum of 28 days\n\nOutcomes\n\nSeparation between low vs intermediate groups in first 3 days:\n\nDay 0: 5.9 vs 9.1 mLKg p<0.001\nDay 1: 6.6 vs 9.3\u00a0mLKg p<0.001\nDay 2: \u00a07.4 vs 9.1mL/Kg p<0.001\nMajority of patients managed in volume controlled mode day 1, but then most changed over to pressure support by day 2\n\n\nPrimary outcome: No statistical difference primary outcome:\n\n21 ventilator-free days at day 28 in both groups (IQR, 0-26) (mean difference, \u20130.27 [95% CI \u22121.74 to 1.19]; P = .71\n\n\nSecondary outcome: No statistical difference in:\n\nMedian length of ICU and hospital stay\nICU and hospital mortality rates\nMortality at day 28\u00a0and 90 days\nLower tidal volume had increased day 1 CO2\u00a043 vs 36mmHg p<0.001\n\n\nSafety:\u00a0No statistical difference in:\n\nARDS, pneumonia, severe atelectasis, pneumothorax, need for or duration of sedatives, analgesics or neuromuscular blockage agents, delirium, fluid balance, transfusions of blood products, use of recruitment maneuvers or other rescue therapies\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn this trial of adult patients in the ICU without ARDS who received invasive ventilation and were expected to not be extubated within 24 hours of randomization, a ventilation strategy using low tidal volume was not more effective than a strategy using intermediate tidal volume with respect to the number of ventilator-free days and alive at day 28\n\nStrengths\n\nThis was a large, multicenter study, including 6 ICUs, improving its external validity\nRandomized study design minimised bias\nImportant understudied clinical question that applies to many patients worldwide\nWell defined protocol reduced variability of interventions\nPre published statistical plan with intention to treat analysis\nIntermediate tidal volume group (10mL/Kg) a closer reflection of current practice than previous trials which have included 12mL/Kg PBW\n\nWeaknesses\n\nInadequate overall separation between the low vs intermediate ventilation strategies after day 1 means this study was likely underpowered to detect any true difference (i.e. false negative trial)\n\nPatients managed with pressure support ventilation particularly had minimal separation as a result of the protocol, and many in both groups had volumes greater than trial targets (supplement)\n\n\nA large number of eligible patients missed entry into the trial (704/2734 or 26%), and many patients or their representatives, refused consent (304/2734 11%). As a result, selection bias was likely to be an issue in the randomised cohort\nTidal volume, although important, may not be most important target for preventing ventilator associated lung injury (Eg driving pressure, mechanical power)\nSignificant heterogeneity of patient population means any benefit in sub groups may be not been detected\n\nPatients with chronic pulmonary disease excluded and therefore results cannot be applied to this population\n\n\nLack of blinding of clinicians may have led to other non measured changes in management biasing the result\nThe primary outcome was a composite end point, and 1 day of ventilator free and alive days at day 28 is of questionable patient centered and clinical significance\nGeneralisability to other settings may be limited due to differences in\u00a0ventilation strategies, sedation, and weaning\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCurrent practice aiming to avoid higher tidal volumes is based on previous ARDS and non ARDS trials which suggest higher volumes may cause harm\nIn this study, no clear difference was found between lower vs higher tidal volumes strategies\nTherefore, clinicians will most likely continue with the current practice to target lower (6-8mL/Kg) tidal volumes in patients without ARDS until further evidence challenges this practice\n\nExternal Links\n\n(1) Fan E, Del Sorbo L, Goligher EC, et al.
