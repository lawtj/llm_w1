Intensive Care Med 2011; 37(4):601-609.\nClinical Question\n\nDoes nutritional support guided by measurements of resting energy expenditure (REE), compared with a weight-based regimen, improve survival in critically ill patients\n\nDesign\n\nRCT, computer generated randomisation\nNon-blinded\n\nSetting\n\nSingle general ICU, Israel\nMay \u2013 December 2007\n\nPopulation\n\nAdult patients who were mechanically ventilated with an expected ICU stay >3 days\nImportant exclusion criteria: FiO2 >0.6; on renal replacement therapy; head trauma with GCS <8; open heart surgery\n944 patients screened of whom 130 eligible\n\nIntervention\n\nTight calorie group: energy goal determined by daily REE measurements using Deltrac II metabolic monitor\n\nControl\n\nEnergy goal based on pre-admission weight (25kcal/kg/day)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: hospital mortality\n\n32.3% in tight calorie group vs. 47.7% in control group, P=0.058\n\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\ncomparing tight calorie group to control group\n\nMean target energy (kcal/day) 1,976 vs. 1,950\nMean energy delivered (kcal/day) 2,086 vs. 1,480, P=0.0\nReceived parental nutrition during the 1st three days of the study 26% vs. 9%, P=0.02\nLength of ventilation 16.1 vs. 10.5 days, P=0.03\nICU stay 17.2 vs. 11.7 days, P=0.004\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors Conclusions\n\nNutritional support guided by REE may be associated with a lower mortality\n\nStrengths\n\nAppropriate primary outcome\nUsed protocol to maintain glucose <150mg/dL in all patients\nIntention to treat analysis\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNon-blinded\nSingle centre\nSmall number of patients\nNo Power calculation\nGroups treated differently\n\nIn the intervention group the dietician in charge of the study was responsible for achieving the energy targets whereas in the control group this was the responsibility of the ward staff\nIn the intervention group they consistently exceeded the target energy delivery whereas in the control group they consistently failed to achieve the target energy delivery\n\n\nConflicting results with longer\u00a0length of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay in the intervention group, but lower mortality. Is this biologically plausible?\nNon-nutritional energy was not taken into account\nConflicts of interest not reported\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe poor study design with major differences in the way the two study groups were treated invalidates the results and we are unable to tell if nutritional support guided by REE improves outcomes compared with a weight based regimen.\nHaving a dedicated dietician improved achievement of target nutrition\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf / abstract / doi:\u00a010.1007/s00134-011-2146-z\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\nNone listed\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DavidSlessor\nSummary date: 1 May 2014\nPeer-review editor: @stevemathieu75\n\n\n\n"
