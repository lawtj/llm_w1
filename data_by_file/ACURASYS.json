Further studies to confirm this finding would be beneficial. These trials should ideally have standardised protocols for the use of co-interventions such as proning and the use of steroids. In the mean time I will need a good reason to not use neuromuscular blocking agents in early severe ARDS.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[open access pdf of article]\u00a0Neuromuscular Blockers in Early Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n[open access pdf of article]\u00a0Life in the Fast Lane: Neuromuscular Blockade in ARDS\n[Further reading]\u00a0Neuromuscular blocking agents in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date: 20 Jan 2014\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@duncanchambler\n\n\n\n\n"
