Intensive Care Medicine 2015; published online first April 2015. doi:10.1007/s00134-015-3796-z\nClinical Question\n\nDoes High-flow therapy by nasal cannula (HFNC) improve the efficiency of preoxygenation before intubation compared with a high fraction-inspired oxygen facial mask (HFFM)\n\nDesign\n\nMulticenter, randomised controlled trial\nOpen-labelled and parallel\nIntention to treat analysis\nRandomisation was computer-generated using fixed blocks of four patients (1:1 ratio) and stratified by centre\nDesigned to detect a 6% increase in\u00a0SpO2\u00a0with HFNC preoxygenation compared with HFFM. With\u00a080% power, 124 patients were required\n\nSetting\n\n6 French ICU\u2019s (3 medical, 2 medical-surgical and one surgical)\nDecember 2012 \u2013 August 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n18 years or older\nAcute hypoxaemic respiratory failure requiring intubation in ICU\n\nDefined by:\n\nrespiratory rate > 30 per minute and a FiO2\u00a0requirement of \u2265\u00a050% to obtain\u00a0SpO2\u00a0\u2265\u00a0\u00a090% AND\nestimated PaO2/FiO2ratio \u2264\u00a0300mmHg\nany point in the the 4 hours before inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusion: contraindications to orotracheal intubation; intubation without anaesthetic rapid sequence induction; requirement for intubation because of cardiac arrest or asphyxia; nasopharyngeal difficulties; grade 4 Cormack-Lehane view; pregnancy\n119 patients\nBaseline characteristics:\n\nSimilar for age, sex, BMI, aetiology for respiratory failure (around half due to pneumonia) and arterial blood gas oxygenation (mean PaO2/FiO2\u00a0ratio\u00a0120mmHg)\nHigher SAPS II score in HFNC group: mean 54.5 vs. 51.3\nNIV used \u00a0in the hour prior to inclusion higher in HFNC group (18%) compared with HFFM group (14%)\nHFNC used \u00a0in the hour prior to inclusion higher in HFNC group (16%) compared with HFFM group (5%)\n\n\n\nIntervention:\n\nHigh Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC)\nPreoxygenation of the patient with high-flow nasal cannula (Optiflow TM) occurred for 4 minutes\n\n60L/min of humidified oxygen flow (FiO2\u00a0100%)\nNasal cannula were maintained in place throughout the endotracheal intubation\n\n\n\nControl:\n\nHigh fraction-inspired oxygen facial mask (HFFM)\nPreoxygenation of the patient with high FiO2\u00a0facial mask occurred for 4 minutes\n\n15l/min oxygen flow\nFacemask was removed after rapid sequence induction to enable laryngoscopy\n\n\n\nIn both groups:\n\n\nPatients receiving non-invasive ventilation, HFNC or HFFM at the time of randomisation were switched to their randomly assigned device at the beginning of the preoxygenation procedure\nAnticipated airway difficulty was predicted by the presence of 2 or more of the following\n\nmedical history of difficult intubation; mouth opening < 3cm; restricted neck movement, thymomental distance < 65mm, Mallampati III or IV\n69.4 % of HFNC group and 57.9% of the HFNC met this criteria\n\n\nJunior doctors (residents) were responsible for most of the intubations: HFNC (82%) and HFFM (72%)\nEtomidate was used as the induction agent in over 50% of cases\nSuxamethonium was used as the neuromuscular blocking agent in 2/3rds of cases (next most frequent was rocuronium)\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Lowest\u00a0SpO2\u00a0during the endotracheal intubation (ETI) procedure\n\nETI = the beginning of laryngoscopy to patient\u00a0connection to the mechanical ventilator\n\n\u00a0HFNC 91.5 [80-96] vs HFFM 89.5% [81\u201395]\u00a0p = 0.44.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: No statistical difference between any of the outcomes apart from duration of mechanical ventilation\n\n4 broad categories:\n\npreoxygenation\nendotracheal intubation (ETI) procedure\nrespiratory outcome\nmorbidity in ICU\n\n\n\n\n\nAdverse events during intubation and the following hour: No statistical difference\n\nAt least one severe complication (death; cardiac arrest; desaturation <80%; systolic blood pressure < 80mmHg or requirement for vasopressors)\n\nOverall: HFNC 58.1% vs HFFM 66.6%\nDesaturation < 80% HFNC 25.8% vs HFFM 22.8%\nCardio-vascular collapse HFNC 38.7% vs HFFM 52.6%\nOne patient in the HFFM had a cardiac arrest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nCompared to HFFM, HFNC as a preoxygenation device did not reduce the lowest level of desaturation.\n\nStrengths\n\nAn external observer and the nurse in charge of the patient concurrently assessed the period\u00a0between the beginning of laryngoscopy to patient connection to the mechanical ventilator\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe 6% hypothesised improvement in\u00a0SpO2\u00a0between the HFFM and HNNC group was based on a previous single study comparing NIV to HFFM. This study may therefore have been underpowered to detect any difference\nThis is a small study with only 119 patients\nThe choice of statistical analysis is unclear. Van Elteren analsysis is typically used where stratification according to a confounding covariate is needed to allow greater statistical power at demonstrating an association between two variables. This has been used to stratify according to medical centres. Why would the results vary between medical centres unless the expertise of medical personnel and protocols are widely varied?\nThe authors do not specify exactly which high FiO2\u00a0facial mask was used. The assumption is that this is a hudson mask with a reservoir bag rather than a tight fitting mask with Ambu reservoir or a Water\u2019s circuit\nNearly a 1/5th of patients were requiring non-invasive ventilation in the hour preceding randomisation. Removing NIV and changing to facemask would have resulted in derecruitment. Whilst high flow nasal may provide some additional PEEP, this would be insignificant compared with NIV.\nThe secondary outcomes are mostly dependent on operator variability. There should be no reason why the presence of HFNC should impact on ability to perform successful intubation. If this study was looking at effectiveness of an adequate face-mask seal during apnoeic oxygenation, this would be far more informative\nLarge difference between the urgency of the intubation. 12 patients (20%) of the HFNC required intubation without delay compared with 16 (51%) in the HFFC group\nNo specific mention of airway being kept patent after induction and before intubation. This would effect the success of apnoeic oxygenation with HFNC\nArterial oxygen measurement would have been more reliable than SpO2. The authors state that arterial access seemed \u2018unthinkable due to the severity of the hypoxaemia and level of endotracheal intubation emergency\u2019. However in 2/3rd of cases, it was concluded that intubation could wait up to one or more hours.\nNo doses of muscle relaxant recorded.\u00a0This may have influenced the difficulty and time to successful intubation\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn this study, using high-flow nasal cannula, without discontinuation during an apnoeic period, was not any more effective\u00a0than using a high FiO2\u00a0facemask at 15 l/min for preventing desaturation during RSI. Given the methodological and statistical concerns, this cannot be concluded with certainty, and if the question is still of interest then a larger RCT is needed.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract] High-flow nasal cannula oxygen during endotracheal intubation in hypoxemic patients: a randomized controlled clinical trial\u00a0\n[further reading] PulmCrit:\u00a0Apneic oxygenation and high-flow nasal cannula don\u2019t prevent desaturation during intubation?\n[further reading] Weingart S and Levitan R: Preoxygenation and Prevention of Desaturation During Emergency Airway Management\n[podcast] Weingart S.\u00a0EMCrit Podcast 40 \u2013 Delayed Sequence Intubation (DSI)\n[further reading] Chrimes N.
