This is not particularly helpful as demonstrating that a patient survives for a few more days will not convince me that the treatment is beneficial. It would have much better if the primary outcome had been 28 day mortality.\nThe results for 28 day-mortality were only statistically significant when adjusted for baseline characteristics. When the raw data is used the results are no longer significant and this is despite the fact that the baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups.\n24% of patients received etomidate that inhibits adrenal corticosteroid synthesis\nTime to antibiotics was delayed, compared to current standards (mean 6hrs in placebo vs. 7.1hrs in steroid group)\nOnly 300 patients randomised from 1326 screened. This limits the external validity.\n\nDifferences Between Annane and Corticus Trials\n\n\nThis study found that patients with septic shock, and relative adrenal deficiency, who were treated with low dose steroids had a significantly improved mortality. This is in contrast to the CORTICUS study which found no improvement in mortality. However, CORTICUS was only powered at 35% to detect a 20% relative reduction of death (ref: Finfer editorial)\nCORTICUS reported a reduction in time to reversal of shock in all patients treated with steroids whereas this study only found this benefit in patients with relative adrenal deficiency.\nThis study included a sicker population than CORTICUS as evidenced by a higher SAPS II Score and mortality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe two biggest studies regarding the use of steroids for septic shock have found conflicting results. On the basis of these studies I will\u00a0not use steroids as routine for patients with septic shock due to the potential side effects. However in patients that are not responding to treatment and are at high risk of death, I will continue to use steroids as some benefits have been reported. I will not base my decision on the corticotrophin result as other studies\u00a0have reported a number of limitations with using this test in critically ill patients. I eagerly await the results of the ADRENAL study which will hopefully allow a more evidenced based decision to be made.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Article full text]\u00a0Effect of Treatment With Low Doses of Hydrocortisone and Fludrocortisone on Mortality in Patients With Septic Shock by Annanne\n[Further reading]\u00a0Survival Distribution Statistics by Prof Madigan of Columbia Uni\n[Further listening]\u00a0Steroids in Sepsis by Jeremy Cohen via ICN/SMACC\n[Further reading]\u00a0Steroids and Septic Shock Literature Summaries by LITFL\n[Further reading]\u00a0The ADRENAL study protocol: adjunctive corticosteroid treatment in critically ill patients with septic shock by Venkatesh et al.\nA trial of corticosteroids in patients with sepsis, aiming to recruit 3,800 patients to answer this same clinical question\n\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date: 3 August 2014\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n\n"
