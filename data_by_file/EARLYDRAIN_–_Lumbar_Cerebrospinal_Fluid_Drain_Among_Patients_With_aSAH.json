JAMA Neurol. 2023; 80:833-842. doi:10.1001/jamaneurol.2023.1792\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH), does lumbar CSF drainage compared to standard therapy improve clinical outcomes as measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 6 months?\n\nBackground\n\naSAH frequently leads to death or permanent disability due to both the initial insult and delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI)\nDCI occurs due to vasospasm in up to 70% of patients with SAH\nThis may be related to blood degradation products in the CSF near the basal cisterns\nIt is hypothesised that CSF drainage via a lumbar drain may preferentially remove more of the blood degradation products due the effect of gravity and thus may decrease rates of vasospasm and DCI\nRetrospective data and meta-analyses of lumbar drain use in aSAH has demonstrated lower mortality, and reduced rates of clinical vasospasm and ischaemic stroke and improved neurological outcomes\nLUMAS, a prospective single centre RCT, including patients with aSAH (WFNS grade 1-3), demonstrated improved rates of delayed ischaemia and early neurological outcome but no difference in outcome at 6 months\n\nDesign\n\nParallel group, multi-centre, open label randomized clinical trial\nRandomization \u2013 1:1 to standard care or additional use of lumbar drain\n\nVia internet randomizer \u2013 permutated blocks of 6\nNo stratification\n\n\nBlinded end-point evaluation\nPatients followed up to their death or 6 months post randomisation\nIntention to treat analysis\nProtocol and analysis plan published prior\nPower calculation:\n\n300 patients would be required to detect a decrease in unfavourable outcome from 50 to 33% with 85% power\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n19 hospitals in Germany, Switzerland and Canada\n\nAll provided 24hr acute neurosurgical and neurocritical care with > 30 aneurysm procedures / year\n\n\nData collected from Jan 2011 to Jan 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n\u2265 18yo, acute SAH with confirmed aneurysm origin via CT-angiography or DSA\nAneurysm treatment within 48hrs of SAH\n\n\nExclusion\n\nPresence of therapeutic anticoagulation\nContraindications for lumbar drain\nAbsent or compressed basal cisterns on admission CT-B\nPregnancy\nReduced life expectancy\nParticipation in another interventional trial\nHaemorrhage from non-aneurysmal origin\nNo haemorrhage present on initial CT-B (Fischer 1/ modified Fischer grade 0)\n\n\n307 patients randomised\n\nLumbar drain > 155 randomised\u00a0 (11 excluded)\nStandard care > 152 randomised (9 excluded)\n\n\nBaseline characteristics of lumbar drain vs. standard care\n\nSimilar between groups\nMedian age: 54 vs 56 years\nFemale: 68% vs 69%\nmRS score of 0 on admission: 94 vs 93%\nPresence of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH):63% vs 59%\nPresence of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH): 39% vs 35%\nWFNS classification:\n\n1 = 37% vs 29%\n2 = 15% vs 15%\n3 = 5 % vs 7%\n4 = 10% vs 11%\n5 = 33% vs 39%\n\n\nModified Fisher score of 4: 59 vs 55%\nLocation, size and number of aneurysms similar\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nInsertion of lumbar drain with drainage of lumbar CSF at 5ml/hr\n\nCommenced within 72hrs of aneurysmal SAH in addition to standard therapy\nContinued for least 4 days and up to 8 days\nSafety: If ICP pressure >20mmHg or >5mmHg difference between ICP + lumbar drain \u2013 recommended to cease lumbar drainage\n\n\nMedian CSF lumbar drainage of 108 mls in first 8 days\n\nControl\n\nNo lumbar drainage\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nTreatment of aneurysmal SAH with endovascular coiling or clipping determined by local treating teams\nLocal teams determined if EVD or ICPm inserted\n\nEVDs inserted in 70.8% of lumbar drain group and 76.9% of control group\nMedian daily drainage via EVD lower in lumbar drain group (98 vs 171 mls)\nTotal CSF drainage via both EVD +/- lumbar drains similar between groups (eFigure 13)\n\n\nLocal standard management for aSAH:\n\nDaily transcranial doppler monitoring as per local protocol\nCerebral vascular imaging via CTA, MRA or DSA for suspected vasospasm or routine day 7 to 10\nTreatment for vasospasm at discretion of local investigators \u2013 not protocolised\n\n\nRates of aneurysm treatment (53 vs 50% coiled) and vasospasm prophylaxis (99 vs 99% nimodipine) use similar between groups\nMAP, fluid intake and fever burden similar between groups\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome (lumbar drain vs control):\n\nRate of unfavourable neurological outcome measured at 6 months (defined as mRS 3 \u2013 6)\nStatistically significant lower rate of unfavourable outcome\n\n32.6% vs 44.8%\nRR 0.73 (95% CI: 0.51 \u2013 0.98;

whilst acknowledging the potential high-risk nature of the intervention, I will await further studies confirming the potential benefits of this intervention\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Effectiveness of Lumbar Cerebrospinal Fluid Drain Among Patients With Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage\u00a0\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Bridget Jones\nSummary date: 23rd January 2024\nPeer-review editor: George Walker\nPicture by: Raman Oza / Pixabay\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
