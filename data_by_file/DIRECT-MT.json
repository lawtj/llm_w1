DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2001123\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with acute anterior ischaemic stroke, is endovascular thrombectomy alone, compared with endovascular thrombectomy preceded by intravenous alteplase, noninferior with respect to modified Rankin score at 90 days?\n\nBackground\n\nPrior studies have established the role of endovascular thrombectomy in the treatment of eligible patients with acute ischaemic stroke (MR CLEAN, EXTEND 1A, ESCAPE, SWIFT-PRIME, REVASCAT)\nThe role of alteplase before and during thrombectomy in patients with ischaemic stroke is unclear\n\nIt may improve reperfusion potential and dissolve distal thrombi but may make proximal thrombi more difficult to retrieve with thrombectomy\nIt may increase cerebral haemorrhagic risks\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nInvestigator-initiated, multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label trial with blinded outcome assessment\nDirect Intraarterial Thrombectomy in Order to Revascularise Acute Ischaemic Stroke Patients with Large Vessel Occlusion Efficiently in Chinese Tertiary Hospitals: a Multicentre Randomised Clinical Trial (DIRECT-MT)\nFunded by the National Health Commission of China and the Wu Jieping Medical Foundation\n\nNo involvement in trial design, conduct, protocol review, manuscript preparation, or decision to submit the manuscript for publication\n\n\n1:1 randomisation with the use of a Web-based system, with stratification according to participating site\nThe treatment-group assignment was known to both the treating physician and the patient\nEstimated that a sample size of 636 would provide the trial with 80% power (at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05) to determine a noninferiority margin of 0.8, assuming a common odds ratio for scores on the modified Rankin scale (mRS) of 1.16\n\nThis effect would correspond to a difference of 4% between the patients in the thrombectomy-alone group in DIRECT-MT who had a mRS score in the 0-to-2 range, and the intervention group in the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischaemic Stroke in the Netherlands) trial\nAssumption of 5% withdrawal and a conservative 15% reduction in the sample size because of adjustment for major prognostic variables that included age, baseline stroke severity (according to the NIHSS score), the modified Rankin scale score before stroke onset, cerebral collateral blood-flow status, and the time from stroke onset to randomisation\nA total of 20 additional patients were enrolled in order to compensate for those who had major protocol violations\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n41 academic tertiary care centres in 18 provinces in China\nSelected on the basis of their stroke treatment capabilities as recorded in a national prospective database of Chinese stroke centre\nRequired to have performed at least 30 endovascular thrombectomy procedures during the previous year\nStudy conducted from February 23, 2018, through July 2, 2019\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion\n\nA clinical diagnosis of acute ischaemic stroke\nOcclusion of the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery (both terminus and nonterminus occlusions) and/or of the first or proximal second segment of the middle cerebral artery confirmed by CTA\nCT or MRI ruling out intracranial haemorrhage\nEligible for IVT and MT (within 4.5 hours after symptom onset)\nNIHSS \u2265 2\nAge of 18 years or older\nWritten informed consent\nInformation about the extent of early cerebral ischaemia on baseline computed tomography (CT) as measured by the Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS;

This means that these results may not apply to centres that give thrombolysis prior to transferring to a tertiary centre for thrombectomy\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis is an interesting study which likely applies mainly to stroke centres with thrombectomy capability, but unclear whether the data are robust enough to affect practice, particularly at smaller facilities without thrombectomy capability\n\nExternal Links\n\nYang.
