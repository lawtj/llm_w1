Pressure supported ventilation was the standard. Both groups were weaned and extubated once pre-defined (and fairly standard) criteria were met. Physical restraints were never used.\n\nOutcome\nIn words\n\nThe primary outcome, which was the\u00a0number of days without mechanical ventilation in a 28-day period beginning at intubation, favoured the intervention of \u2018no sedation\u2019.\n\nThe difference between the mean of each group was 4.2 days (95% CI 0.3\u20138.1).\n\n\nThe secondary outcomes\u00a0either favoured the intervention of \u2018no sedation\u2019 (some with statistical significance and some without), or showed no difference, with the exception of the incidence of delirium:\n\nICU length of stay \u2013 statistically significant mean difference of 9.7 days\nHospital length of stay \u2013 statistically significant mean difference of 24 days\nIn hospital mortality \u2013 trend toward better outcome with \u2018no sedation\u2019 but not statistically significant\nBrain radio-imaging \u2013 no difference in need\nAccidental extubation \u2013 no difference in occurrence (n=7 [13%] vs n=6 [10%], p=0.69)\nVentilator associated pneumonia (defined as CXR changes and one of fever, \u00a0high or low white cell count, or purulent sputum) \u2013 no difference in occurrence\nRe-intubation \u2013 no difference in need\nDelirium \u2013 greater incidence in the \u2018no sedation\u2019 group (n=11 [20%] vs n=4 [7%], p=0.04). This may represent difficulty to detect delirium in sedated patients, rather than a true difference in incidence.\n\n\n\nIn numbers\n\nPrimary Outcome\n\n\nMeasure\nNo Sedation\nSedation\nMD\n95% CI\np\n\n\n\n\nVentilator-free days\nMean (SD)\n13.8 (11.0)\n9.6 (10.0)\n4.2 days\n0.3\u20138.1\n0.0191\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Ventilator-free days\u2019 = number of days from intubation to day 28 where mechanical ventilation was not requires; MD = mean difference; SD = standard deviation; CI = confidence interval; p = p-value\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Outcomes\n\n\nMeasure\nNo Sedation\nSedation\nHR\nAD\np\n\n\n\n\nICU LOS\n(median days)\n13.1\n22.8\n1.86\n(95% CI 1.05\u20133.23)\n9.7\n0.0316\n\n\nHospital LOS\n(median days)\n34\n58\nn/a\n24\n0.0039\n\n\n\n\nMeasure\nNo Sedation\nSedation\nOR\nARR\nNNT\np\n\n\n\n\nIn-Hospital Mortality\n36%\n47%\n0.65\n(95% CI 0.31\u20131.39)\n10.2\n10\n0.27\n\n\n\n\nLOS = Length of Stay; HR = Hazard Ratio; AD = Absolute Difference; OR = Odds Ratio; ARR = Absolute Rate Reduction; NNT/NNH = Number needed-to-treat\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nResults from this single-centre study suggest that a strategy of no sedation is promising, but a multi centre trial is needed to show that the benefits of this strategy can be reproduced in other facilities.\n\nStrengths\n\nAuthors designed trial to question their own established practice.\nControl group were treated as per previously published protocol by Kress, allowing direct comparison.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThere was a baseline difference in patient gender, with a greater proportion of women being allocated to the control group. Although not reported, this difference is statistically significant (p=0.05 by Fisher\u2019s exact test). Given the adequate concealment of allocation, this is likely to have occurred by an outside chance. In my opinion, it is unlikely that this gender difference will have affected the observed primary or secondary outcomes, but that cannot be said with certainty.\nGiven the intervention of \u2018no sedation\u2019 was the institution\u2019s normal practice, and the complete lack of any blinding, there is an inherent bias towards finding a larger difference in favour of the intervention (i.e. a more positive outcome). This also reduces the external validity, as there may be a learning curve associated with using \u2018no sedation\u2019.\n19% of the randomised patients were excluded from data analysis (modified intention-to-treat analysis) as they were extubated or dead within 48 hours. Whilst this is a common method (see Kress for example), I would like to see mortality and length of stay data including these patients. Unbiased and fair randomisation should minimise any bias from this modified analysis.\n10 (18%) patients in the \u2018no sedation\u2019 group deviated from protocol and received continuous sedation. This will reduce the observed difference, and highlights the difficulty with applying this \u2018no sedation\u2019 strategy despite their expertise and staffing.\nThe outcome measures were reported as corrected for baseline characteristics using multiple linear regression statistics. Although the uncorrected findings were still statistically significant (p=0.035), it may have been better to report all raw data then a selection of corrected data.\nNon-standard definition of ventilator-associated pneumonia.\nAdditional staffing was required to support 20% of the \u2018no sedation\u2019 patients, compared to 5% of the \u2018sedation\u2019 patients. This additional resource may outweigh any benefit from a reduced length of stay. The 24 hour availability of an ICM specialist doctor may also reduce the generalisability to units with less staffing.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study should make clinicians question the dogma of sedation in ICUs, but clinical practice should not change immediately because of this study alone.\nA strategy of \u2018no sedation\u2019 may be feasible in ICUs, but may require additional staffing.\nFurther multi-centre trials are required with patient-centred outcomes and cost-analyses.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Original article abstact]\u00a0A protocol of no sedation for critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation: a randomised trial by T Strom\n[PhD thesis paper]\u00a0Sedation on ICU by T Strom\n[Editorial] Less sedation in intensive care: the pendulum swings back by L Brochard\n[Critique] Pushing the envelope to reduce sedation in critically ill patients by O Ogundele\n[Critique] An appraisal of \u2026 by G Harlow\n[Further reading]\u00a0Daily Interruptions of Sedation in Mechanically Ventilated Patients by C Nickson\n[Further reading] Sedation and Delirium in the Intensive Care Unit by M Reade and S Finfer\n[Further reading] Critical Care Challenge: Sedation and Delirium in the Intensive Care Unit by S Finfer and J-L Vincent\n[SOP \u2013 Academic Department of Critical Care, Portsmouth] Sedation and Delirium in Critical Care\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 10th July 2014\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@davidslessor\n\n\n\n"
