Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 12:459-468\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with submassive PE, does the use of tenecteplase + heparin, compared to heparin alone, improve patient orientated outcomes?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nDouble-blinded\nPlacebo-controlled\n\nSetting\n\n8 centres in the USA\nAugust 2008 \u2013 October 2012\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: adult patients with submassive PE\n\nPE diagnosed on CT-PA\nNormal systolic BP\nRight ventricular strain (any of the following)\n\nhypokinesis on echocardiography\nelevated Troponin I or T\nBNP >90pg/ml or NT proBNP >900pg/ml\n\n\n\n\nExclusion: BP<90mmHg, contraindications to thrombolysis\n83 patients randomised\n\nIntervention\n\ntenecteplase\u00a0+ heparin\n\ntenecteplase: weight tiered dose in accordance with TNKase insert\n\n\n\nControl\n\nplacebo\u00a0+ heparin\n\n\nIn both groups patients treated with 1mg/kg enoxaparin or 200units/kg dalteparin. This was administered subcutaneously prior to the tenecteplase or placebo.\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\ncomposite adverse outcome\n\nwithin 5 days \u2013 PE related or treatment related\n\nPE related\n\ndeath\nhypotension requiring vasopressor infusion\nintubation\n\n\nTreatment related\n\ndeath from haemorrhage\nmajor bleeding (intracranial or intraspinal haemorrhage, active bleeding with >2g/dL drop in haemoglobin within 24hrs requiring transfusion; bleeding that required surgery, endoscopic or intravascular treatment)\n\n\n\n\nwithin 90 days\n\nrecurrent PE\npoor functional capacity\n\nRight ventricular hypokinesis or dilatation or RV systolic pressure >45mmHg\nExercise intolerance or dyspnoea at rest\n\ninability to walk 330m using 6 minute walk test\nsevere dyspnoea defined by NYHA functional class 3/4, assessed by questionnaire\n\n\n\n\nPoor physical \u00a0health related quality of life outcome\n\nSF36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) score <30\nVEINES QOL survey <40 (Impact of post-thrombotic syndrome)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignificant improvement in tenecteplase group vs. placebo\n\n15% vs. 37% had at least 1 adverse outcome, (Difference =22%, 95% C.I for the difference 3.2-40, P=0.017, NNT 5)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes at 90 day follow up (tenecteplase vs. placebo):\n\nNYHA class 3/4: 5.4% vs 20.5%, P=0.051,\n6 minute walk distance: 407 vs. 403m, P=0.9\n6 minute walk distance <330m: 16% vs. 28%, P=0.19\nSelf assessment of overall health (1-10, 1 worst, 10 best): 3.3 vs. 2.4, P=0.036\n\nThis was the only individual outcome that had a significant improvement\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nTreatment with tenectaplase was associated with increased probability of a favourable outcome\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised\nDouble-blinded\nCONSORT diagram\nUse of patient orientated outcomes\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnder-powered. Trial terminated early due to lead author relocating to a new institution that led to insurmountable legal and administrative barriers. Is this a first?\nComposite outcome that included many variables. Some of these variable are things that would be important to me if I was the patient where as some would not concern me e.g. need for vasopressors. With so many variables included it is difficult to determine what the exact benefits are. Due to the difficulties in recruiting enough patients to determine a mortality difference, future studies will need to utilise similar outcomes. I would prefer these studies to use a simpler approach, have a primary outcome of functional assessment at 3 months and secondary outcomes of mortality and major haemorrhage. This would still require more patients than the present study recruited\nMost of the patients (>70%) had heart rates of < 110 & SBP\u2019s > 100mmHg. 50% were troponin or BNP negative. 35% did not even get an echo. Whilst the authors\u2019 have been explicit about their definition of submassive PE, this group is perhaps at a lower risk and does not represent the patients we truly wish to capture\n\nThe study was financially supported by Genetech who make tenecteplase. They were not involved in the study design or data analysis\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\nIn patients with submassive PE, the use of tenecteplase resulted in a reduction in adverse outcomes based on a complicated composite outcome. However, the only independent variable that reached statistical significance was related to a self assessment of overall health at 90 days. This was simply the patients\u2019 response to being asked \u2018how would you rate your overall health?\u2019 (mean was 2.4 vs. 3.3 out of 10). The study was small, under powered and incomplete, which limits any conclusions that can be made. I would not be persuaded to thrombolyse a patient with submassive PE based on this study.\n\n\n\nLinks\nabstract / doi: 10.1111/jth.12521\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\nLife in the fast lane\nRAGE podcast\npulmccm.org\nEMCrit Blog: Fibrinolysis in Pulmonary Embolism\u00a0\n\nMetadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0@DavidSlessor\n\n\nSummary date: 21 June 2014\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@stevemathieu75\n\n\n\n\n"
