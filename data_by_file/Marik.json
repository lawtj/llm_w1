CHEST 2016; published on line first Dec 2016 doi:10.1016/j.chest.2016.11.036\nClinical Question\n\nDoes intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine in addition to standard treatment, improve mortality in ICU patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, compared with standard treatment alone?\n\nDesign\n\nRetrospective observational study\nSingle centred\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre in US\nJanuary \u2013 July 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and a procalcitonin (PCT) >2 ng/ml\nExclusion: patients aged < 18 years; pregnancy; patients with limitations of care\n47 patients\nBaseline characteristics (demographics, diagnosis, co-morbidities, positive blood cultures and interventions) were similar in both groups\n\nIntervention\n\nVitamin C + Hydrocortisone + Thiamine in addition to standard treatment\n\n1.5g QDS Vitamin C intravenously for 4 days or until ICU discharge\nHydrocortisone 50mg QDS intravenously for 7 days or until ICU discharge followed by a taper over 3 days\n\u00a0200mg thiamine BD for 4 days or until ICU discharge\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard treatment\n\nBoth groups\n\nreceived empirical broad spectrum antibiotics which were then deescalated according to microbiological data and clinical progress\nmanaged by a conservative physiologic based fluid and vasopressor strategy\n\n24 hour fluid balance: 2.1 +/- 3.2L in the treatment group and 1.9 +/-2.7 in the control group\n72 hour fluid balance: 1.9 +/- 3.7L in the treatment group and 1.6 +/-3.3 in the control group\n\n\nventilated with a lung protective strategy avoiding hyperoxia\nreceived limited use of sedative agents (dexmedetomidine preferred agent)\nNorepinephrine was the vasopressor of first choice and titrated to a dose of 20 mcg/min targeting a mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg. Vasopressin (0.04 units/min) was added \u00a0followed by phenylephrine or epinephrine if the target MAP was not achieved\nenteral nutrition was commenced 24 hours after ICU admission and once clinical stability was achieved\ndeep venous thrombosis prophylaxis with both enoxaparin (or heparin in patients with a calculated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and sequential compression\npermissive hyperglycaemia was allowed\nRoutine stress ulcer prophylaxis was not administered\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Hospital mortality\n\n8.5% (4 of 47) in the treatment group compared to 40.4% (19 of 47) in the control group (p < 0.001)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nmean duration of vasopressor therapy: 18.3 \u00b1 9.8 hours after starting treatment with vitamin C protocol vs 54.9 \u00b1 28.4 hours in the control group P<0.001\nrequirement for renal replacement therapy in patients with AKI: 3 patients (10%) in the treatment group vs 11 (37%) in the control group P=0.02\nmedian ICU length of stay: 4 days in both groups\nPCT clearance (initial PCT minus PCT at 72 hours divided by the initial PCT multiplied by 100): 86.4% in the treatment group vs 33.9% in the control group\nThe 72-hour delta SOFA score (difference between subsequent scores) was 4.8 \u00b1 2.4 in the treatment group compared to 0.9 \u00b1 2.7 in the control group (p<0.001).\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe early use of intravenous vitamin C, together with corticosteroids and thiamine may prove to be effective in preventing progressive organ dysfunction including acute kidney injury and reducing the mortality of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Additional studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings\n\nStrengths\n\nAn interesting hypothesis generating study which has some biologically plausible explanations for benefit in sepsis\nVitamin C and thiamine are cheap and relatively safe. However, vitamin C toxicity can cause renal failure and the safety profile would be best evaluated in the context of an RCT\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNot an RCT\nSmall numbers\nSingle centre\nMultiple interventions and therefore not possible to determine which, if any, are associated with improved outcome\nThe treatment and control periods were not concurrent and occurred during different seasons\n60% of patients in the control group were treated with corticosteroids\nDetails are provided for the underlying reason for death (including advanced dementia, severe heart failure, advanced sarcoidosis and severe COPD) but not for the control group\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study is hypothesis generating. An RCT is required to determine the efficacy of vitamin C, steroids and thiamine in severe sepsis and septic shock. The results of ADRENAL will help guide future use of corticosteroids. I will not consider using vitamin C or thiamine in sepsis until additional studies, demonstrating benefit, are completed. Until then, I will eagerly wait to see if the combination of vitamin C, steroids and thiamine offers a \u2018Marikle\u2019 cure for sepsis\n\nExternal Links\n\n[abstract]\u00a0Hydrocortisone, Vitamin C and Thiamine for the Treatment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock: A Retrospective Before-After Study\n[further reading] A randomized clinical trial of ascorbic acid in open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair\n[further reading]\u00a0ADjunctive coRticosteroid trEatment iN criticAlly ilL Patients With Septic Shock (ADRENAL)\n[further reading]\u00a0Effect of high-dose ascorbic acid on vasopressor requirement in septic shock\n[further reading]\u00a0Vitamin S (Steroids) and Vitamin C for the Treatment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock!\n[further reading]\u00a0Vitamin C revisited\n[blog post]\u00a0PulmCrit- Metabolic sepsis resuscitation: the evidence behind Vitamin C\n[podcast] EMCrit Wee \u2013 Edited Version of Paul Marik on the Metabolic Resuscitation of Sepsis\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Steve Mathieu\nSummary date: 31st Jan 2017\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0Adrian Wong\n\n\n"
