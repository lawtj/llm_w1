NEJM 2022;386:1627-1637; DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2116735\nClinical Question\n\nIn neonates undergoing elective endotracheal intubation, does nasal high-flow therapy compared with standard care, improve 1st pass success without physiological instability?\n\nBackground\n\nA multicentre, international registry reported that 1st pass success in neonatal intubation was only 50%\nNeonates have a lower functional residual capacity and a greater metabolic demand than older children and adults. This can contribute to physiological instability during intubation attempts. The same registry reported that in ~half of the intubations performed, the neonates SpO2 dropped by \u226520%\nHigh flow nasal oxygen has been used in adults to aid intubation and prolong apnoea time\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n\nComputer-generated random-assignment sequence based on permuted blocks with varying block sizes\nStratified according to trial centre, post-menstrual age (\u226428 or >28 weeks), and the use of premedication for intubation\n\n\nNon-blinded\nIntubation attempt defined as insertion of laryngoscope blade beyond the lips until its removal from the mouth\nPhysiological instability defined as decrease in SpO2 of 20% from baseline or HR <100\nAll intubations were recorded, including recording of oxygen saturation monitor\nPrimary outcome assessed by independent assessment of video\nSample size calculation\n\n246 intubations would give 90% power to detect an increase in the primary outcome from 30% to 50% with a 2 sided alpha level of 0.05\n\n\nModified intention to treat analysis (excluded patients that had exclusion criteria)\nPrimary outcome adjusted for randomisation stratification factors\nRegistered on Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry\n\nSetting\n\nTwo tertiary neonatal intensive care units in Melbourne, Australia\nData collected: 2018 \u2013 2021\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nInfants undergoing oral endotracheal intubation in the delivery room or neonatal intensive care unit\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nNasal intubation\nUrgent intubation as determined by the treating clinician\nHR <120 beats\nContraindication to high-flow therapy (e.g., congenital nasal anomaly, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, or abdominal wall defect)\nCyanotic congenital heart disease\nSuspected or proven severe COVID infection in the infant or mother\n\n\n462 intubations were eligible for randomisation. 258 intubations randomised. 7 excluded post randomisation\nComparing baseline characteristics of

videolaryngoscopy\n\n9.7% vs 7.1%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nHigh flow nasal oxygen\n\nApplied immediately before laryngoscopy, set at 8l/min\nFiO2 was set at the concentration delivered before laryngoscopy and was increased to 100% oxygen if SpO2 <90%\nDiscontinued after 1st intubation attempt\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard care\n\nLaryngoscopy performed without high-flow nasal oxygen or supplemental oxygen\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nThe pre-intubation FiO2, the use of VL and the duration of intubation attempt was at the discretion of the treating clinician\nPre-medication with atropine, fentanyl and suxamethonium was standard practice for intubations that occurred outside the delivery room\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Successful intubation

likelihood of successful intubation without physiological instability\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nMulti-centre\nVideo recording of intubation attempt and SpO2 monitor, with independent review of video to assess primary outcome\nStratified according to operator experience\n\nWeaknesses\n\nClinicians were not blinded but impossible to do, and use of sham high flow may have affected standard care as may have prolonged intubation attempt\nOnly conducted in 2 tertiary centres in 1 country, limiting external validity\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFor neonates undergoing intubation, the first pass success rate without physiological instability is low\nThe application of high flow nasal oxygen immediately prior to laryngoscopy significantly increased the rate of successful intubation on the 1st attempt without physiological instability \u2013 this is particularly pronounced for operators with limited experience\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Nasal High-Flow Therapy
