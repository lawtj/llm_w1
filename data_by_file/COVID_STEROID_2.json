The trials included used a dexamethasone equivalent dose of 6-16mg. However, the majority of patients included were from the RECOVERY trial\nIn a non-COVID ARDS trial (DEXA-ARDS) the use of higher dose dexamethasone (20mg from day 1-5, then 10mg from day 6-10) compared with standard treatment resulted in significantly fewer ventilator days\nThere are concerns about the side effects with higher doses of steroids, particularly severe fungal infections\nThis trial tried to determine if patients who had severe COVID-19, would benefit from a higher dose of dexamethasone\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n\nComputer generated allocation sequence\nStratified by trial site, age below 70 years, and use of mechanical ventilation at time of screening\nPermuted blocks of varying size\n\n\nBlinding of patients, clinicians and trial investigators/statisticians\nSample size calculation: 1000 patients required for trial to have a 85% power to show a relative reduction of 15% in 28 day mortality and a 10% reduction in time on life support from a baseline of 30% mortality and 10% remaining on life support at day 28\nIntention to treat analysis (included 8 patients who were erroneously randomised but not patients who did not consent to the use of their data)\nPrimary outcome assessed using the Kryger Jensen and Lange test adjusted for stratification variables\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\n\nSetting\n\n31 sites between 26 hospitals in Europe and India\n\n485 patients in Denmark, 369 in India, 79 in Sweden, 49 in Switzerland\n\n\nData collected: August 2020 \u2013 May 2021\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdult patients hospitalised with confirmed COVID-19\nUse of either\n\nSupplemental oxygen at a flow of at least 10l/min (mask or nasal cannula)\nNon-invasive ventilation or CPAP\nInvasive mechanical ventilation\n\n\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nUsed systemic corticosteroids for other indications in doses higher than 6mg dexamethasone equivalents\nHad used systemic corticosteroids for COVID-19 for 5 days or more\nInvasive fungal infections or active TB\nPregnancy\nHypersensitivity to dexamethasone\nInformed consent unavailable\n\n\n1000 patients randomised, 982 patients included in intention to treat population, and 971 patients had data for the primary outcome analysis\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nAge: 65 vs 64\nMale: 70% vs 68%\nCo-existing conditions\n\nDiabetes: 27% vs 34%\nImmunosuppression therapy within prior 3 months: 8% vs 9%\nChronic use of corticosteroids: 3% vs 3%\n\n\nTime from hospitalisation to randomisation: 2 vs 2 days\nOxygen supplementation\n\nInvasive ventilation\n\n22% vs 20%\nFiO2: 0.6 vs 0.6\n\n\nNon-invasive ventilation or CPAP\n\n24% vs 26%\nFiO2: 0.58 vs 0.60\n\n\nOpen system\n\n55% vs 53%\nO2 flow: 22 vs 24l/min\n\n\n\n\nCo-interventions used at randomisation\n\nDexamethasone: 1 vs 1 day\nVasopressors or inotropes: 16% vs 14%\nIL-6 inhibitors: 11% vs 10%\nUse of systemic anti-bacterial agents: 63% vs 66%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nHigh dose dexamethasone\n\n12mg (as dexamethasone phosphate 14.4mg)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard dose dexamethasone\n\n6mg (as dexamethasone phosphate 7.2mg)\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nDexamethasone given IV once daily for up to 10 days from randomisation. If patients had used dexamethasone for COVID-19 prior to enrolment, the intervention period was reduced so that patients received dexamethasone fro a maximum of 10 days\n\nGiven for median 7 vs 6 days\n\n\nRecommended against the use of other immunosuppressive drugs\nFrom Jan 2021 the use of tociluzimab was accepted\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Number of days alive without life support (i.e. invasive mechanical ventilation, circulatory support or renal replacement therapy) at 28 days \u2013 no significant difference\n\n22 days (IQR 6-28) vs 20.5 days (4-28), adjusted mean difference 1.3; 95% CI 0.0-2.6, P=0.066\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nComparing intervention vs. control group\n\nNo significant difference in\n\n28 day mortality\n\n27.1% vs 32.3%, adjusted relative risk 0.86; 95% CI 0.68-1.08, p=0.097\nIf 3 fewer people had died in the intervention group the result would then have been significantly different (Fisher\u2019s exact test)\n\n\nSerious adverse reactions at 28 days (i.e. new episodes of septic shock, invasive fungal infection, clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding, or anaphylactic reaction to dexamethasone)\n\n11.3% vs 13.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-hoc analysis\n\nECMO used significantly less in intervention group\n\n0.6% vs 2.9%\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nTreatment with dexamethasone 12mg vs 6mg did not significantly improve days alive without life support at 28 days , however the lower limit of the 95% CI was 0.0 suggesting that the results are most compatible with a benefit from 12mg\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nBlinding of patients, staff and researchers\nRelatively large sample size\nMinimal loss to follow up with vast majority of patients receiving treatment that they were allocated to\nMulti-centre\n\nWeaknesses\n\n29 fewer patients included in primary analysis than planned according to power calculation\nIt may have been preferable to have 28 day mortality as primary outcome\nWe are told the number of patients who received IL-6 inhibitors at randomisation but not the total number that received them during the intervention period\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with severe COVID-19 who were predominately not treated with tociluzimab, the use of 12mg compared with 6mg dexamethasone resulted in no significant difference in the number of days alive without life support at day 28, or 28 day mortality\nThe confidence intervals suggest the potential that there may be a benefit with higher dose dexamethasone but the trial was under-powered to determine this. If there is a difference between treatment groups, it is much less likely that 6mg would give a benefit compared with 12mg. As there was no significant difference in side effects between treatment groups it could be argued that we should change to 12mg dosing for dexamethasone\nHowever there were low numbers of patients treated with tociluzimab in this trial. Following the Recovery and REMAP-CAP trial results tociluzimab has become standard care. We do not know the impact that the standard use of tociluzimab would have had on these results\nI will consider using a higher dose of dexamethasone in patients with severe COVID-19 that are unable to receive tociluzimab. In patients that have received tociluzimab, I will continue to use 6mg of dexamethasone, but in selected cases I would consider escalating this dose\nAn upcoming Bayesian analysis of the data from the study group will hopefully aid the decision making\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Dexamethasone 12 mg versus 6 mg for patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxia: an international, randomized, blinded trial\n[further reading]\u00a0DEXA-ARDS\n[further reading]\u00a0@nickmmark twitter thread \n\nMetadata\nSummary author: David Slessor\nSummary date: 22nd August 2021\nPeer-review editor: Segun Olusanya\nImage by Sam Moqadam on Unsplash\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
