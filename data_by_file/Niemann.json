It would have been more useful if the primary outcome was a longer term outcome rather than the requirement for dialysis in the first week\nInformation on outcome of other organs that were donated not stated\nNo set criteria for when dialysis was performed\nThe study randomised 394 patients (~788 kidneys) but only had data on 566 transplanted kidneys. This is a loss of 28% (n=222). Whilst mostly unavoidable (medical issues, withdrawal of consent, not transplanted, 2.7% data incomplete) their analysis is consequently not intention-to-treat and so may bias toward a positive outcome.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn organ donors, following death by neurological criteria, the use of therapeutic hypothermia vs. normothermia, significantly decreased the recipient\u2019s requirement for dialysis during the 1st week post-transplant. This benefit was more marked for patients at a higher risk of graft failure. Further studies are required to confirm this finding, \u00a0to demonstrate the longterm outcomes, and to investigate the outcomes for other organs that are transplanted.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0Therapeutic Hypothermia in Deceased Organ Donors and Kidney-Graft Function\n[open access pdf of article]\u00a0Therapeutic Hypothermia in Deceased Organ Donors and Kidney-Graft Function\n[Supplementary Appendix]\u00a0Supplementary Appendix\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date: 8th August 2015\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@duncanchambler\n\n\n\n"
