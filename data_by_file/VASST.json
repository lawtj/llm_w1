NEJM\u00a02008; 358(9):877-887. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa067373\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients with septic shock, does the addition of vasopressin infusion to a\u00a0norepinephrine infusion\u00a0compared to a norepinephrine infusion alone decrease\u00a0mortality rate at 28 days?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\nStratified by severity of shock\nDouble-blinded (patient, clinician and assessors)\nModified intention-to-treat analysis\n\nPatients that were randomised but did not receive the study infusion were excluded from analysis\nThis decision was taken during recruitment phase of trial without awareness of data\nIt was felt that this would not introduce bias as allocation should be equally distributed between groups\n\n\nPower calculation:\n\nBaseline mortality 60%\nPowered at 80% to detect absolute 10% difference\nTwo-sided alpha error of 0.05\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n27 centres across Canada, Australia and United States of America\nJuly 2001 to April 2006\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\u00a0Over 16 years old with septic shock\n\n2 SIRS criteria\nProven or suspected infection\nNew organ dysfunction\nFluid-unresponsive shock requiring at least 5 microg/min norepinephrine (or equivalent) for at least 6 hours\n\n\nExclusion:\u00a0open-label vasopressin prior to inclusion; unstable coronary syndrome; acute mesenteric ischaemia; hyponatraemia (<130mmol/l); traumatic brain injury (GCS < 8); Raynaud\u2019s phenomena; pregnancy; disease with < 6 month prognosis\n6229 patients screened \u2013> 802 randomised \u2013> 778 analysed\n\n3.0% lost to follow up, withdrew or excluded post-randomisation\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nVasopressin 0.01 to 0.03 U per minute\n\nMade as 30 units in 250 ml 5% dextrose (0.12 U/ml)\nCommenced at 5.0 ml/h\nIncreased by 2.5 ml/hr every 10 minutes until 15 ml/hr reached\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNorepinephrine 5 to 15 microg per minute\n\nMade as 15 mg in 250 ml 5% dextrose (60 microg/ml)\nCommenced at 5.0 ml/hr\nIncreased by 2.5 ml/hr every 10 minutes until 15 ml/hr reached\n\n\n\nManagement common to both\n\nTarget blood pressure defined as 65 to 75 mmHg, but modified at clinician\u2019s discretion\nDuring initiation, open-label vasopressor was used to maintain constant mean arterial blood pressure\nOpen label vasopressor was allowed to continue if study drug infusion was at maximum rate allowed\nOpen label vasopressor was preferentially weaned\nWeaning of study drug infusion was permitted once target mean arterial blood pressure was maintained for 8 hours without open-label vasopressors\nCross-over or open-label vasopressin were not allowed\nIf subsequent recurrence of shock required\u00a0vasopressors, the study drug was preferentially used\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nNo significant difference in rate of death at 28 days\nVasopressin group 35.4% vs norepinephrine group 39.3%\nAbsolute risk reduction 3.9% (95% CI -2.9% to +10.7%)\nP = 0.26 by Fisher\u2019s exact test; Fragility Index -12\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\u00a0no significant difference in\u2026\n\nMortality at 90 days\nDays alive and free of organ dysfunction\nNeed for renal replacement therapy\nNeed for vasopressor\nNeed for corticosteroids\nLength of stay (ICU and hospital)\nAdverse incidents\n\n\nOther measures:\n\nMean arterial blood pressure was similar between groups\nHeart rate was lower in vasopressin group\nNorepinephrine\u00a0infusion rate was lower in vasopressin group (i.e. vasopressin was open-label norepinephrine sparing)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nLow dose vasopressin commenced at 6 hours after the initiation of shock therapy does not decrease mortality\nWith 95% confidence, this trial excludes a benefit of greater than 10.7% or a harm greater than 2.9%, suggesting that vasopressin use is acceptable in clinical practice but warrants further investigation\n\nStrengths\n\nGood external generalisability \u2013 multi-centre trial with appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria\nAcceptable internal validity \u2013 appropriate methodology and statistical testing\n\nWeaknesses\n\nClinical question \u2013 the design was to compare vasopressin vs norepinephrine but since the majority of patients in the vasopressin group also received open-label norepinephrine, this trial is actually investigating \u2018the addition of vasopressin to standard vasopressors vs standard vasopressors alone\u2019\nClinical relevance \u2013 the dose of vasopressin was low, which is possibly why the safety profile was not dissimilar to noradrenaline\nLimited external generalisability \u2013 baseline mean arterial pressure was\u00a0~72mmHg suggesting the patients in this trial were not refractory to vasopressors before\u00a0randomisation (i.e. they were not the really sick patients in whom you might consider using additional vasopressors)\nSome internal validity concerns \u2013 exclusion of patients post-randomisation may have unforeseen effects and could introduce bias\nStatistical weakness \u2013 the trial was under-powered as\u00a0the observed mortality rate was considerably less than the expected mortality rate; consequently a false negative conclusion is possible\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial does not demonstrate a mortality benefit from adding vasopressin if mean arterial pressure is\u00a0adequately maintained with standard\u00a0vasopressors, however\u00a0the strength of this evidence is not strong enough to conclude it definitely does not have a benefit\nI shall continue using vasopressin in vasopressor-refractory septic shock, which this trial has\u00a0not investigated\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Vasopressin versus Norepinephrine Infusion in Patients with Septic Shock\n[further reading]\u00a0VANISH trial TBL summary\n[further reading]\u00a0Vasopressin by LITFL\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Duncan Chambler\nSummary date:\u00a08 August 2016\nPeer-review editor: Adrian Wong\n\n\n"
