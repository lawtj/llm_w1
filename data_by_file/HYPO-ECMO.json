HYPO-ECMO study \u2013 A Randomized Clinical Trial \nLevy et al | Journal of the American Medical Association | Feb 2022 DOI:10.1001/jama.2021.24776\nClinical Question\nIn patients with cardiogenic shock receiving venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(VA-ECMO), does early use of moderate hypothermia (33-34\u00b0C) compared with strict normothermia (36-37 \u00b0C) improve 30 day mortality?\nBackground\n\nVA-ECMO is an increasingly common intervention for cardiogenic shock refractory to standard therapies\nSevere cardiogenic shock, especially in patients with associated cardiac arrest, may be associated with ischemia reperfusion injury\nPatients with refractory cardiogenic shock requiring VA-ECMO likely have most severe ischaemia reperfusion injury\nModerate hypothermia\n\nMay mitigate effects of ischemia reperfusion injury\nWell tolerated in patients after cardiac arrest / with cardiogenic shock\nHowever, not associated with significant change in haemodynamics or mortality\n\n\nLack of data addressing hypothermia with ECMO \u2013 current recommendation is normothermia\nRapid temperature control is easily achieved during ECMO treatment which may improve the effectiveness of moderate hypothermia\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, unblinded, parallel-group randomised clinical trial\nUnblinded trial due to nature of intervention\nStudy powered to 80% to detect a 15% relative reduction in the primary outcome (30-day mortality) using an estimated mortality of 50% in patients with cardiogenic shock supported by VA-ECMO\n\nSetting\n\nConducted in ICUs at 20 French cardiac shock care centres between October 2016 and July 2019\nFinal follow-up occurred in November 2019\n\nPopulation\nInclusion Criteria\n\nEndotracheal intubation\nReceiving VA-ECMO for cardiogenic shock for < 6 hours\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n\n\nYounger than 18 years of age\nPregnant\nVA-ECMO after cardiac surgery for a heart +/- lung transplant\nLVAD implantation\nVA-ECMO for acute poisoning with cardiotoxic drugs\nUncontrolled bleeding (bleeding despite medical intervention with surgery or drugs)\nVA-ECMO after CPR > 45 minutes\nOut-of-hospital refractory cardiac arrest\nAlready participating in interventional research\nUnder guardianship\nIrreversible neurological injury\nNo longer receiving life-sustaining therapies\n\n\n\n786 patients

randomization by adjusting VA-ECMO circuit temperature controller for initial 24 hours\nFollowed by progressive rewarming (0.1- 0.2 \u00b0C per hour) to 37 \u00b0C, and maintained at 37 \u00b0C for subsequent 72 hours\n18 withdrew consent leaving 168 in primary outcome analysis\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNormothermia\n\nTemperature maintained between 36 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C during first 24 hours and at 37 \u00b0C during subsequent 72 hours\nAmong the patients who had a cardiac arrest, core temperature was strictly maintained at 36 \u00b0C\n22 withdrew consent leaving 166 in primary outcome analysis\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nVA-ECMO initiated per local practice with blood flow settings set to ensure adequate tissue perfusion\nPatients then randomized to moderate hypothermia or normothermia\nFurther ICU therapy provided in accordance with generally accepted intensive care practices\n\nOutcome\nPrimary Outcome\n\nMortality at 30 days: no significant difference (42% vs 51%) with adjusted OR 0.71 (95% CI 0.45 \u2013 1.13, p=0.15)\n\nSecondary Outcomes\n\nComposite outcome of death, heart transplant, escalation to LVAD or stroke\n\nAt 30 days: 52% vs 64%, OR 0.61 (95% CI 0.39 \u2013 0.96) \u2013 statistically significant\nAt 60 days: 58% vs 66%, OR 0.70 (95% CI 0.44 \u2013 1.11)\nAt 180 days: 61% vs 69%, OR 0.69 (95% CI 0.43 \u2013

0.79 (95% CI 0.50 \u2013 1.25)\nAt 180 days: 52% vs 58%, OR 0.81 (95% CI 0.51 \u2013 1.29)\n\n\nClinical Outcomes: No difference in any of the below\n\nVA-ECMO duration from randomisation\nNet intake of intravenous fluids at day 7\nLength of use of vasopressors\nTime to normalisation of lactate\nNumber of days alive without organ failure at day 7\nVentilator free days at day 30, 60 or 180\nKidney replacement therapy free days at day 30, 60 or 180\nLength of stay in ICU or in hospital overall\n\n\n\nAdverse Events\n\nNumber of moderate and severe bleeding events was not different between groups\nNumber of units of packed red blood cells transfused during VA-ECMO was higher in the moderate hypothermia group\nNumber of nosocomial infections was not different between groups\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn a mixed population of adults requiring VA-ECMO for refractory cardiogenic shock, early application of moderate hypothermia for 24 hours did not significantly increase survival compared with normothermia. However, the 95% confidence interval was wide and included a potentially important effect size, warranting further study\n\nStrengths\n\nWell-designed, multi-centre study performed in the emergency setting\nAdequate randomisation with concealment\nNo loss to follow up\nStandardised protocol for temperature regulation\nSimilar baseline characteristics between groups\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPatients with all cardiogenic shock aetiologies were included, leading to a degree of heterogeneity\nPotential for bias to due lack of blinding\nStrict inclusion and exclusion criteria \u2013 limits applicability of findings\nTrial was underpowered to statistically detect a survival benefit of <15%\nNo sensitivity analysis excluding patients with cardiac arrest\nIndividual component of the composite secondary outcome not reported\nVery large number of secondary outcomes without correction increasing risk of a false positive results\nMedium and long-term outcomes not evaluated, e.g. neurocognitive sequelae, which may have been clinically relevant\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nEarly moderate hypothermia for patients requiring VA-ECMO was not shown to reduce 30 day mortality\nThe observed effect size could be clinically significant and warrants further investigation\nI would be interested to know if there was a difference in effect size between those with and without cardiac arrest\nFor now I will continue to utilise normothermia for patients requiring VA-ECMO for refractory cardiogenic shock\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle: HYPO-ECMO\nfurther reading TTM-2\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Dinesh Giritharan\nSummary date: 28th May 2022\nPeer-review editor: Alastair Brown/Aidan Burrell\nPicture by: Pexels: Blue Icebergs Under Cloud\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
