Compared with standard treatment esmolol also increased stroke volume, reduced noradrenaline requirements + was associated with an improved 28 day mortality.\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nPowered for primary outcome\nStandardised resuscitation strategies\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle centre, non-blinded, no placebo (potential for overestimate of effect size, and for unconscious bias in care delivery)\nPrimary outcome is not clinically relevant\nNot powered for secondary outcomes e.g. mortality\nUsual care was significantly different to standard UK practice (PA catheters, ubiquitous use of steroids, fluid resuscitation for 96 hours guided by filling pressures, high use of levosimendan 49.4% in esmolol group). Therefore, significant concerns about generalisability of results.\nThe patients in this study appear to have been very unwell at baseline (median dose of noradrenaline approaching 0.4ug/kg/min at enrolment), with a high prevalence of multi-resistant organisms cultured. Despite this, 28 day mortality of 80% in the control group is concerning, and raises substantial questions of whether a similar results would be seen in patients with a lower severity of illness. As Pinksy states\u00a0\u201c80% mortality in the control group can hide a lot of sin.\u201d\nA non-standard method of calculating SAPS II scores was used (at study enrolment after resuscitation, rather than taking the worst values in the first 24 hours of ICU admission) for reasons that aren\u2019t well explained in the paper. This makes it difficult to compare this cohort with those in other intensive care units.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe use of esmolol for tachycardic patients in septic shock resulted in good control of heart rate, and a reduction in noradrenaline dose, without any significant side effects. \u00a0A large mortality benefit was reported with the use of esmolol; but with a number of \u00a0study limitations, further evidence is required before a change in practice is justified.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0[Effect of Heart Rate Control With Esmolol on Hemodynamic and Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Septic Shock A Randomized Clinical Trial]\n[Further Reading]\u00a0Pinksy Critical Care Journal Club\n[Podcast]\u00a0Myburgh Intensive Care Network\n[Further Reading]\u00a0EM Docs Beta Blockers in Sepsis\n[Further Reading]\u00a0RCT: Esmolol improves clinical outcome and tissue oxygen metabolism in patients with septic shock through controlling heart rate\n[further reading]\u00a0The influence of esmolol on septic shock and sepsis: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies.\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @MikeW_J\u00a0(from Portsmouth journal Club)\nSummary date: 10 November 2014\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@davidslessor\n\n\n\n"
