JAMA. 2013;309(20):2130-2138. doi:10.1001/jama.2013.5124\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients with relative contraindications to early enteral nutrition (EN), does providing early parenteral nutrition (PN), improve mortality?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nBlock randomisation with variable block sizes\nStratified by site, age and BMI\nSingle-blind\nIntention to treat analysis\nPower calculation: with baseline mortality of 29.7%, a sample size of 1470 patients required to detect a 7.7% risk difference between groups, with 90% power\n\nSetting\n\n31 community and tertiary hospitals in Australasia\nOctober 2006 \u2013 June 2011\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria\n\nAdult patients admitted to ICU\nConsidered ineligible for EN by the attending clinician due to a short-term relative contraindication\nExpected to remain in ICU for >2 days\n\n\nExclusion criteria\n\nNot expected to survive 24 hours, or receiving palliative care\nLicensing contraindication to PN e.g. pregnancy, allergy\n\n\n1372 patients randomised\n\n46% Emergency Surgery\n20% Elective Surgery\nMean APACHE II score 21\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nEarly PN (Kabiven G19%, Fresenius Kabi Australia)\n\n\u2018Early\u2019 defined as within 24 hours of ICU admission\nMean time from ICU admission to randomisation was 13.8 hours\nMean time from randomisation to PN was 44 minutes\n\n\nEnergy target\n\nset by Harris-Benedict equation\ncapped at 35kcal/kg/day\nIf BMI 30+ then fed to ideal body weight (BMI = 21)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard care\n\nNot defined by protocol\n\n278 (40.8%) never received EN or PN during their 3.72 (95% C.I. 2.65-5.2) ICU stay\n199 (29.2%) started EN after 2 days (95% C.I. 1.43-2.78), of whom 48 eventually received supplemental PN\n186 (27.3%) started PN after 2 days (95% C.I. 1.45-2.7)\n19 (2.8%) started both EN + PN\u00a0at the same time after 5.58 days (95% C,I, 3.9-7.96)\n13 (1.9%) patients received EN, PN, or oral feed within 24 hours of ICU admission\n\n\nOverall remained unfed for mean 2.8 days \u00a0(95% C.I. 2.3-3.4)\nOf note in Australasia it is NOT accepted practice to infuse isolated glucose solutions to provide caloric intake prior to initiating feeding\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary Outcome\n\n60 day mortality \u2013 no significant difference\n\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nQuality of life and physical function\n\n\u00a0RAND-36 General Health Status \u2013 \u00a0significant improvement in early PN group, however, magnitude of difference did not exceed one-half the standard deviation, which was defined a priori as clinically meaningful\nECOG performance status \u2013 \u00a0no significant difference\nRAND 36 physical function \u2013 no significant difference\n\n\n\n\nTertiary Outcomes\n\nLength of mechanical ventilation \u2013 significantly shorter in early PN group\nICU stay \u2013 no significant difference\nHospital stay \u2013 no significant difference\nNo differences in any types of infection\n\n\nSubgroup analysis\n\nNo significant differences in 60 day mortality based on BMI, age or chronic insulin treated DM\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe use of early PN did not result in significant differences in 60 day mortality or infection rates\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised\nIntention to treat analysis\nMulti-centre\nEarly enrollement of patients (mean time from ICU admission to enrolment 13.8hrs)\nPatients treated with early PN received >90% of target feed\nPragmatic study \u2013 comparing early parenteral nutrition with standard treatment. However, the downside of this is that standard treatment varies and this trial therefore compares it against all of these.\nMinimal exclusion criteria leading to high external validity. The downside of this is that in\u00a0the control group 41% discharged from ICU within 3.72 days (95% CI, 2.65-5.20)\u00a0without feeding. In these patients it may have been optimistic to hope to find a large mortality benefit. It may be that patients with more prolonged critical illness would be more likely to benefit from early PN.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNon-blinding of study intervention and outcome assessment\nIn the standard care group nearly 40% of patients received parenteral nutrition, the majority within a few days. Therefore it is not surprising that there was no difference in infectious complications found\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn critically ill patients with a short-term relative contraindication to enteral nutrition, the use of early parenteral nutrition did not affect 60 day mortality or infection rates compared with starting feeding at ~3 days. I therefore won\u2019t be in a rush to start early PN.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Free full-text]\u00a0Early Parenteral Nutrition in Critically Ill Patients With Short-term Relative Contraindications to Early Enteral Nutrition A Randomized Controlled Trial\n[Further reading]\u00a0University of Virginia journal club\n[Further reading]\u00a0LITFL Nutrition summaries\n[Further reading]\u00a0Critical Care Nutrition\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date: 8th September 2014\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n\n"
