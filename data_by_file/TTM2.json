NEJM June 17, 2021 DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2100591\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients who are unconscious following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, does targeted hypothermia compared with targeted normothermia, impact all-cause mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nThere have been several randomised trials investigating temperature management following cardiac arrest\nThe\u00a0HACA trial (n=137) and Bernard trials (n=77) published in NEJM in 2002 reported that therapeutic hypothermia following a VF arrest improved favourable neurological outcome. However, small sample sizes and other methodological flaws meant the evidence was of low certainty. A number of patients in the control group developed fever and it was therefore unclear if the reported benefits were from hypothermia or the avoidance of fever\nThe\u00a0TTM (2013) study (n=950) compared a targeted temperature of 33\u00b0C vs. 36\u00b0C in patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from a presumed cardiac cause. They reported no significant difference in all-cause mortality\nThe HYPERION trial (n=584) showed that in patients with coma following a non-shockable cardiac arrest, the use of moderate hypothermia improved favourable neurological outcome at 90 days compared with targeted normothermia\nThe European Resuscitation Council released new guidelines in March 2021. These suggest:\n\nmaintaining a target temperature at a constant value between 32 and 36\u00b0C for at least 24 h\navoidance of fever (> 37.7\u00b0C) for at least 72 h\u00a0after\u00a0ROSC in patients who remain in coma\n\n\nFever is associated with worse outcomes\n\nDesign\n\nInternational, multicentre, parallel group trial\nRandomised, superiority trial\nCo-enrolment with the TAME trial (Targeted Therapeutic Mild Hypercapnia)\nRandomisation occurred in the emergency department\nWeb-based allocation using permuted blocks of varying sizes (stratified by site + TAME randomisation) in 1:1 ratio\nPre-specified secondary outcomes (neurological outcome and health related quality of life) and subgroup analyses (sex, age, time to ROSC, initial rhythm and whether shock present on admission)\nOutcomes assessed at 30 days, 6 months, 24 months (ongoing)\nBlinding:\n\nNon blinded clinicians, however assessors of prognosis, participants, outcome assessors, statisticians, data managers blinded.\nDuplicate manuscripts were written for each scenario before randomisation was revealed\n\n\nOutcome assessment was by face-to-face interview (72%) or telephone interview (particularly used when the COVID-19 pandemic began). Where possible the patient and a proxy were used to obtain information\nMRS was performed via a structured interview with interviewers receiving formal training\nPower Calculation: A total of 1862 participants gave a power of 90% (alpha 0.05, NNT 13.3) to detect an absolute risk reduction of 7.5% in mortality (assuming 55% mortality). This was increased to 1900 to account for loss to follow-up\n\nSetting\n\nNumber of countries: 14 countries, 61 institutions\n\nHighest recruiting countries: Sweden, UK, Switzerland, France, Czech Republic\n\n\nDates of randomisation: pilot phase began late 2017. Active recruiting through 2018 to early 2020\nLast data collection: 6-month follow-up completed mid 2020 with 24 month follow-up ongoing\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac or unknown cause\nSustained ROSC: >20 minutes of circulation without need for chest compressions\nUnconscious: as defined by the FOUR score motor response <4 and not able to obey verbal command\nNo limitations to management in place\nInclusion must be no later than 180 minutes after ROSC\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nUnwitnessed cardiac arrest with initial rhythm asystole\nTemperature on admission < 30\u00b0C\nOn ECMO prior to ROSC\nSuspected pregnancy\nIntracranial bleed\nSevere COPD with long-term home O2\n\n\n4355 patients screened.\n\n55% not randomised due to exclusion criteria:\n\nmost commonly >180 minutes since ROSC, non-cardiac cause for arrest, not unconscious, limitations to care in place\n\n\n1900 randomised\n1861 analysed as intention to treat (39 withdrew consent)\n\n930 in Hypothermia arm, 931 in Normothermia arm\n\n\n1850 analysed for survival (11 lost to follow-up)\n\n\nBaseline characteristics between groups (Hypothermia vs Normothermia). No significant difference in:\n\nAge (mean 64 vs. 64)\nSex (80% male vs. 79%)\nShockable Rhythm (72% vs. 75%)\nBystander CPR (82% vs. 78%)\nShocked on admission (28% vs. 30%)\n\nDefined as SBP < 90mmHg for > 30 minutes or evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion\n\n\nMedian time to ROSC (25 minutes vs. 25 minutes)\nTemperature on admission (35.3\u00b0C vs. 35.4\u00b0C)\nLactate (5.9 vs 5.8)\nSTEMI (41% vs 40%)\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nHypothermia group: target temperature 33C\n\nRapid cooling achieved by cold fluids and physical cooling devices (surface or intravascular devices).\nA feedback-controlled system used to maintain target temperature (bladder temperature probe)\nRewarming began after 28 hours (increase temperature by no more than 0.3\u00b0C per hour until 40 hours)\n95% of patients received cooling\n70% cooled with external devices and 30% with intravascular devices\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNormothermia group: In participants who developed a temperature of 37.8\u00b0C (trigger), a device was used and set at 37.5\u00b0C\n\nPharmacological and conservative therapies initiated first\nPhysical cooling devices (surface or intravascular) used if temperature \u2265\u00a037.8\u00b0C\n\nPhysical cooling devices could be placed prophylactically, but no active cooling was provided for patients who had a spontaneous temperature of <37.8C\n\n\nA feedback-controlled system used to maintain target temperature\n46% of patients needed a device to achieve target temperature (of these 69% used surface cooling, and 31% used intravascular cooling)\nIn 1st 24 hours ~5% of temperatures recorded at >38C\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nNormothermia from 40 \u2013 72 hours (36.5\u00b0C \u2013 37.7\u00b0C) \u2013 temperature management could be initiated after 40 hours\nSedation mandated in both groups until the end of the intervention period (40 hours)\nProtocolised step-wise protocol for treatment of shivering\nAt 96 hours a neurological assessment was performed by a blinded clinician \u2013 only following this was withdrawal of life sustaining treatments allowed for presumed poor neurological outcome.\n\nStandardised criteria for what was considered a likely poor neurological outcome were used\n\n\nOther than above patients were managed as per clinician preferences. There were no differences (hypothermia vs normothermia) in:\n\nCardiac catheter rates: 78% vs. 78%\n\n90% vs 87% within 2 hours\n\n\nPCI: 38% vs. 38%\nCAGs: 1% vs 2%\nAICD: 16% vs 16%\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: No difference in all-cause mortality at 6 months\n\nComparing HYPOTHERMIA vs NORMOTHERMIA\n\n50% (465/925) vs 48% (446/925)\n\nRR 1.04 (95% CI 0.94-1.14, p = 0.37)\nHR for death in hypothermia group 1.08 (95% CI 0.95-1.23)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: No difference in secondary outcomes\nComparing HYPOTHERMIA vs. NORMOTHERMIA\n\nProportion of people with a poor functional outcome (modified Rankin scale, mRS 4-6) at 6 months: 55% vs 55% (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 \u2013 1.09)\nHealth-related quality of life: EQ-VAS (patient perception of outcome) (Scale 0-100, with 0 being the worst health, 100 being perfect health)\n\nMean score 74 vs 75\n\n\n\n\nAdverse events:\n\nHigher rates of arrhythmias with haemodynamic instability in hypothermia group:\n\n\u00a024% vs 16% (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.21 \u2013 1.75, p<0.001)\n\n\nComparing hypothermia vs normothermia, no difference in:\n\n\n\nPneumonia: 36% vs 35%\nSepsis: 11% vs 9%\nBleeding: 5% vs 5%\nSkin complications due to the device: 1% vs <1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients suffering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, induced hypothermia did not lead to lower mortality\nFunctional outcome and health related quality of life did not improve from hypothermia\n\nStrengths\n\nThis was an excellently conducted randomised trial with large numbers and a superb effort from all involved\nDesign based on data achieved from multiple previous trials meaning a robust sample size calculation and estimate of absolute risk reduction\n\nMortality in trial (50%) similar to that used in power calculations\n\n\nExcellent internal validity:\n\nAlthough 56% of those screened seems like a large proportion not to be enrolled, only 1.6% were for unknown reasons\nAllocation concealment and blinding of everyone involved except (understandably) treating clinicians\nIntention to treat analysis\nClear separation between groups\nNear complete follow-up\n\n< 1% missing data on mortality\n94% had functional outcome assessed by mRS\n\n\nProtocolised care minimised variability in practice\n\nOnly 3 protocol deviations related to temperature management\n\n\n\n\nExternal validity high due to the multicentre and multinational nature of the study\n\nWeaknesses\n\nMedian temperature of 34\u00b0C in the hypothermia arm achieved at 3 hours after randomisation. Cooling was not implemented pre-hospital. It is logistically very difficult to achieve any earlier rapid cooling for many reasons (e.g. patients needing to go to cardiac catheter lab)\n\nThe trial does not answer the question as to whether ultra-early cooling may be beneficial\n\n\nAn ARR of 7.5% was an ambitious difference to achieve, particularly given the TTM results which showed no difference between 33\u00b0C and 36\u00b0C. However, the authors based this on the original 2002 trials\nIt would be helpful to know exact numbers of patients in the normothermia group who were febrile. A graph is given in the supplementary index but it is difficult to give accurate numbers looking at this graph\nThe trial does not guide our management of In-Hospital-Cardiac-Arrest, so generalisability to this cardiac arrest group is limited\n20% of patients were co-enrolled in the TAME trial, 10% in each group. This could potentially be a confounder but this will not be known until the results of this trial are published\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI will aim for normothermia in my patients following out of hospital cardiac arrest. I will implement targeted temperature management if temperature exceeds 37.7\u00b0C\nFuture exploration may include a trial of normothermia vs no targeted temperature management\n\nExternal Links\n\nHypothermia versus Normothermia after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest\nTranslating Targeted Temperature Management Trials into Postarrest Care\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford @celiabradford\nSummary date: June 17 2021\nPeer-review editor: George Walker\nPicture by: iStock\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
