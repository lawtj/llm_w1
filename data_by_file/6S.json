NEJM 2012;367:124-34. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1204242\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill adults with severe sepsis, does 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) compared to Ringer\u2019s acetate reduce the incidence of death or end stage kidney failure?\n\nBackground\n\nSeptic shock is a complex heterogeneous state with a combination of fluid deficiency and vasoplegia\nIntravenous fluid therapy is currently a key treatment, with international guidance recommending up to 30 ml/kg as boluses for the initial treatment of sepsis\nColloids and crystalloids are available and numerous trials have attempted to identify the best fluid for restoring intravascular volume\nStarch-based colloids vary by the molecular weight and substitution ratio, and preparations with high molecular weight and high substitution ratios were shown to be associated with acute kidney injury\nThis 6S trial attempted to investigate a starch-based colloid with relatively lower molecular weight and substitution ratio\n\nDesign\n\nInvestigator initiated, blinded, stratified, parallel-group clinical trial\nComputer generated allocation sequence\nTreatment assignments were concealed from patients, clinicians, research staff, data monitoring and safety committee, the statistician, and the writing committee (when it wrote the first draft of the abstract)\nRandomisation stratified according to the presence or absence of shock, presence or absence of haematological cancer, and admission to a university or non-university hospital\n800 patients required for study to have 80% power to show an absolute between group difference of 10% in the primary outcome measured at a two-sided alpha significance level of 0.05, assuming a 45% mortality rate and a 5% rate of dependence on dialysis at 90 days\n\nSetting\n\n26 intensive care units (13 university and 13 non university)\nDenmark, Finland, Norway and Iceland.\nData collected between December 2009 and November 2011\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: adult patients who needed fluid resuscitation in the ICU, as judged by ICU clinicians, who fulfilled the criteria for severe sepsis within the previous 24 hours\n\nCriteria for severe sepsis was defined as sepsis plus at least one organ failure\nOrgan failure was defined as SOFA score >2 for the organ in question\nSepsis was defined as definitive source of infection plus at least two systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria met\n\n\nExclusion: medical reasons (eg burns, intracranial bleeding, already receiving renal replacement therapy); if they had received more than 1000 ml synthetic colloid in the previous 24 hrs; enrolled in another ICU study\n1211 patient assessed for eligibility and of these 804 underwent randomisation\n\n400 were then assigned to each group\n\n\nBaseline characteristics were similar between the two groups (Starch group vs Ringer\u2019s acetate group)\n\nMedian age: 66 years vs 67 years\nMedian SOFA score: 7 vs 7\nNon-surgical admission: 62% vs 59%\nSource of sepsis:\n\nPulmonary: 53% vs 57%\nAbdomen: 33% vs 33%\nUrinary: 14% vs 12%\nSoft tissue: 10% vs 12%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nStarch group \u2013 6% Hydroxyethyl Starch (HES)\n\n6% HES 130/0.42 in Ringer\u2019s acetate (Tetraspan 6%) was given if volume expansion was required\nPrepared by staff not involved in trial or patient care\nHidden by custom-made opaque bag\n\n\n\nControl\n\nRinger\u2019s acetate group\n\nOne litre of this crystalloid contains:\u00a0Na+ 145.0 mmol, K+ 4.0 mmol,\nCa2+ 2.5 mmol, Mg2+ 1.0 mmol, Cl\u2013 127.0 mmol, malic acid 5.0 mmol and acetate 24.0 mmol\nControl group received Ringer\u2019s acetate if volume expansion was required\nPrepared by staff not involved in trial or patient care\nHidden by custom-made opaque bag\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nRoutine management of patient was maintained apart from which resuscitation fluid was used\nFluids given for a maximum of 90 days\nMaximum daily dose of 33 ml/kg of ideal body weight to nearest 500 ml\n\nFurther fluid, if required, was unmasked (open label) Ringer\u2019s acetate\n\n\nIf bleeding, reaction of renal replacement therapy (RRT) occurred, trial fluid was permanently stopped and replaced by 0.9% sodium chloride or Ringer\u2019s lactate\nOther crystalloid and albumin solutions were allowed except for the indication of volume expansion\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Composite primary outcome was death or dependence on dialysis 90 days after randomisation\n\nHES Group: 51%\nRinger\u2019s acetate Group: 43%\nRelative risk (RR): 1.17 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.36; P=0.03)\nAbsolute risk increase (ARI): 7.5% (95% CI 0.6% to 14.4%)\nNumber needed to harm (NNH): 14\nFragility Index (FI): 2\nOnly one patient in each group was dependent on dialysis at 90 days.\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nUse of renal replacement therapy\n\n22% HES group compared with 16% Ringer\u2019s acetate group\nRR: 1.35 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.80;

P=0.43)\nARI: 2.69% (95% CI -4.02% to 9.40%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nPatients with severe sepsis who received fluid resuscitation with hydroxyethyl starch compared with Ringer\u2019s acetate had a higher risk of death within 90 days and were more likely to receive renal replacement therapy\n\nStrengths\n\nLow risk of ascertainment bias as all groups and procedures blinded\n\nOpaque bags hung over fluid during administration\nFirst draft of abstract written without knowledge of group assignment\nTreatment assignments concealed from patients, clinicians and research staff alongside the data monitoring and safety committee and statistician\nIncreases internal validity of trial\n\n\nWeb-based randomisation process with stratification\n\nPrevents prior knowledge of allocation\nPrevents bias due to differences in management between sites by balancing randomisation within each site\n\n\nPragmatic approach taken\n\nOnly resuscitation fluid used was altered not routine management\nUniversity and non university hospitals included\nFew exclusion criteria\nMakes this more generalisable to other patient populations\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nA significant proportion of patients received fluid volumes in excess of the protocol, although this was balanced fairly evenly between the two groups so it is unlikely to have led to a bias\nReductions in external validity of study\n\nImpact of conclusion may not be huge in UK as starch-based fluids are not commonly used in UK\nRoutine management of patients was not standardised across all 26 sites \u2013 study only recommended sites follow international guidelines\nNearly 300 patients were excluded because they had already received >\u00a01000 mls synthetic colloid in previous 24 hours or had undergone renal replacement therapy\nNo haemodynamic monitoring used during study which is more commonplace in practice today to help guide treatment\n\n\nUse of composite outcome places dependence on RRT as equally significant to death and reduces the power to conclude association with each independently\n\nAs numbers dependent on RRT were so low, the impact is negligible and the primary outcome is effectively mortality at 90 days\n\n\nTime to death analysis reported no significant difference (P = 0.14; Hazard Ratio not available) despite binomial death event analysis demonstrating a difference\n\nIf the occurrence of death (yes or no) differed but not the time to death (when), is the conclusion of this trial a statistical fluke (false positive or Type 1 error) or a truth (in which case the time to death analysis is a false negative or Type 2 error)?\nUsually a time to event analysis provides greater statistical power (greater certainty that the conclusion is correct)\n\n\nThe low Fragility Index demonstrates that this trial only just found a statistically significant difference between the groups and this adds to the concern above \u2013 is this a statistical fluke?\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis paper shows a statistically significant difference suggesting that the use of hydroxyethyl starch increases the risk of death and use of renal replacement therapy, which is in keeping with other trials in similar populations with similar starch-based fluid interventions\nI would be cautious using starch-based fluids in patients with severe sepsis but this conclusion may not be valid for other populations or colloid formulations\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Hydroxyethyl Starch 130/0.42 versus Ringer\u2019s Acetate in Severe Sepsis\n[further reading]\u00a0CHEST trial summary\u00a0by TBL\n[further reading]\u00a0Fluid bolus therapy\u00a0by LITFL\n[further reading] Colloids versus crystalloids for fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients\u00a0by Cochrane Library\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Jo Davy\nSummary date: 5 July 2018\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
