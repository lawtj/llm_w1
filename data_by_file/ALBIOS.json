N Engl J Med 2014; 370(15):1412\u201321.\nClinical Question\n\n\nIn adults with severe sepsis or septic shock, does 20% albumin solution with crystalloid fluid compared to crystalloid fluid alone reduce death with 28 days?\n\n\nDesign\n\n\nRandomised, controlled clinical trial\nStratified according to participating ICU and time between onset of sepsis and randomisation (<6 hours vs >6 hours)\nOpen-label (non-blinded)\n\n\nSetting\n\n\n100 intensive care units in Italy\nAugust 2008 to February 2012\n\n\nPopulation\n\n\nInclusion: adults who met the clinical criteria for severe sepsis (SIRS + proven or suspected infection + at least one organ dysfunction as measured by SOFA score)\nExclusions: Head injury, congestive heart failure, over 24 hours since inclusion criteria met, objection to blood products, albumin indicated for specific clinical reason.\n1818 participants\n\n\nIntervention\n\n\n20% albumin and crystalloid solution\n\n300ml of 20% albumin daily to maintain serum albumin at 30 g/l or more\nCrystalloid as clinically indicated at physician\u2019s discretion\n20% albumin accounted for median daily average of 4.3% of the total administered fluid\nMedian total daily fluid was 3,738ml for first 7 days (compared with control this was a non-statistically significant difference [p=0.10])\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\n\nCrystalloid as clinically indicated at physician\u2019s discretion\nMedian total daily fluid was 3,825ml for first 7 days\n\n\nOutcome\n\n\nPrimary outcome: mortality at 28 days was not different between groups\n\n31.8% in albumin group versus 32.0% in crystalloid group; RR 1.00 (CI 0.87\u20131.14; p=0.94).\n\n\nSecondary outcome: mortality at 90 days was not different between groups\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\nThe addition of albumin to crystalloids during the first 28 days of treatment to maintain a serum albumin level of 30 g/l or more is safe, but does not provide a survival advantage over crystalloids alone over a follow-up period of 90 days\n\n\nStrengths\n\n\nPragmatic study directly relevant to clinical practice.\nOnly 29 participants lost-to-follow-up (1.6%), which is well below primary outcome rate (minimal attrition bias).\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\n\nOpen-label, non-blinded methodology may have influenced clinicians\u2019 decisions, which may have biased toward either intervention or control.\nLower incidence of death compared to anticipated rate (45% used in power calculation) may have lead to type 2 error (failure to detect a true positive outcome).\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\nThe use of 20% albumin in adults with severe sepsis will improve haemodynamic indices, but will not reduce mortality. It\u2019s use is safe but not recommended for routine fluid resuscitation. Targeting a serum albumin of 30g/l or more does not appear to have a survival advantage.\n\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf not available without subscription\u00a0/ abstract / doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1305727\nEditorials, Commentaries or Blogs\n\nNone listed\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: May 2014\nPeer-review editor: @stevemathieu75\n\n\n\n"
