Published online March 21, 2017\nClinical Question\n\nIn ventilated patients with sepsis, does a sedation strategy with dexmedetomidine compared with no dexmedetomidine improve mortality and number of ventilator-free days?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised control trial\n\nPermuted block randomisation \u2013 stratified by centre, presence of emergency surgery, COPD, soft tissue infection\nBlock size of 4 (physicians were not notified of this during study)\n\n\nOpen-label (Physicians non-blinded)\nBlinding of statistician performing statistical analysis\nConsecutive patients\nSuperiority trial\nIntention to treat analysis\nPrimary outcomes changed during study period\n\nInitially set as mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation\nChanged in 05/2015 to mortality and 28 day ventilator free days as duration of ventilation highly influenced by mortality\n\n\nPre-determined weaning\u00a0criteria\nPower calculation\n\nBased on results of MENDS trial with a predicted 60% mortality in the intervention group vs. 80% based in control group: 172 patients to achieve 80% power with a 2-sided \u03b1 level of 0.05 for 28-day survival\nAimed to recruit 200 patients to allow for 15% drop-out/withdrawal rate\n\n\nStatistical tests\n\nCox-proportional hazards model to estimate hazards ratio and 95% confidence intervals\nChi-squared or Fisher exact tests for other clinical outcomes between groups with categorical variables;

with small block sizes clinicians may have been able to predict which group the patient was likely to be allocated to.\nLower dose of dexmedetomidine used in Japan due to limits placed by Japanese medical insurance\nMENDS trial used to calculate sample size required for this study but important differences exist between DESIRE and MENDS: higher APACHE II scores in MENDS subgroup, lower dosage limit of dexemedetomidine and increased age of patients in DESIRE\n\nThe study was underpowered to detect an absolute difference in mortality of 9%, which is still clinically significant\n\n\nStudy had two primary outcomes. Did not perform power calculation for ventilator free days; and primary outcome changed during study period.\nSix patients in control group received dexmedetomidine at physicians discretion\nMeasurement of ventilator-free days is arguably not a patient-centered outcome and no long-term patient outcomes recorded\nAlthough not statistically different there were some baseline differences between groups. The numbers of patients with pancreatitis were 3% vs. 9%. As pancreatitis is not an infection, including it as part of a sepsis trial may not have been appropriate due to differences in mortality and length of ventilation.\n\u00a0No mention of how many patients received NIV or IPPV in each group\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn ventilated patients with sepsis or pancreatitis, this study fails to demonstrate a significant impact of dexmedetomidine on 28-day survival or ventilator-free days but was likely underpowered for mortality. Further well-powered studies with clear patient-centered outcomes are required before dexmedetomidine should be considered as the gold standard sedative for ventilated patients with sepsis on ICU.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of Dexmedetomidine on Mortality and Ventilator-Free Days in Patients Requiring Mechanical Ventilation With Sepsis: A Randomized Clinical Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0LITFL Dexmedetomidine\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Gary Misselbrook\nSummary date:\u00a029th March 2017\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@davidslessor\n\n\n"
