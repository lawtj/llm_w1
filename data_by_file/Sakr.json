Intensive Care Med 2008;34:1999\u20132009\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients admitted to the ICU do overweight/obese patients compared with normal weight patients have a greater risk of morbidity and mortality?\n\nDesign\n\nPlanned post-hoc analysis of a previous trial: The SOAP Study\nProspective, observational cohort study\nConsecutive sampling\nPre-printed data collection forms\nFollow up until death, hospital discharge or for 60 days\nA priori statistical plan\nMultivariate Cox proportional hazard model with time to in-hospital death right censored at 60 days\nVariables included in the Cox regression analysis were age, gender, co-morbid diseases, SAPS II and SOFA scores on admission, the type of admission (medical or surgical), the presence of sepsis, and the need for mechanical ventilation or renal replacement therapy during the ICU stay[short key points]\n\nSetting\n\n198 European intensive care units\nData collection: 1st-15th May 2002\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\u00a0All patients >15yrs old admitted to ICU\nExclusion:\u00a0ICU Stay <24hrs AND only admitted for routine post-operative care/monitoring\n3147 patients enrolled, Body Mass Index (BMI) reported in 2878\n\nIntervention\n\n4 sub-groups\n\nUnderweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), n=120\nOverweight (BMI 25\u201329.9 kg/m2), n=1047\nObese (30\u201339.9 kg/m2), n=424\nVery obese (\u226540 kg/m2), n=81\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNormal weight: (BMI (18.5\u201324.9 kg/m2), n=1206\nFor all patients:\u00a0Body mass index calculated from actual measurement or \u2018best clinical estimate\u2019\nBaseline characteristics:\nSignificant age difference between:\n\nOverweight (63.6 years) and obese (63.5 years) patients, compared with normal weight patients (58.4 years), p<0.01\nUnderweight patients (52.6 years) compared with normal weight patients, p<0.01\n\n\nVery obese (61.7%) and under weight (53.2%) patients were significantly more commonly female compared with normal weight patients (38.1%)\nComparing underweight patients vs. normal weight patients\nThe SOFA score on admission was significantly lower: 3.7 vs. 5.1, p<0.01\nThe incidence of respiratory failure on admission was significantly lower: 12.5% vs. 20.8%, p<0.01. (In comparison the incidence in obese patients was 25.9% and 24.7% in very obese.)\nBMI unrelated to incidence of diabetes, heart failure or cancer in the study sample\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: not defined\nPre-determined outcomes:\n\nMortality\n\nICU and hospital mortality was unrelated to BMI\nSAPS II adjusted odds ratio for hospital mortality was not significantly increased in any of the weight categories compared with normal weight in a subgroup analysis stratifying patients according to sex, age, the presence of sepsis, septic shock, or shock due to any cause, the type of admission (medical or surgical), and ICU length of stay of more or less than 2 days\nMorbidity\nStatistically significant increased incidence of ICU-acquired infections in obese (10%, p<0.01) and very obese (12%, p<0.05) groups compared to normal weight (9%). However, incidence of sepsis syndromes similar among groups\nSignificantly higher rate incidence of respiratory organ failure in obese patients (46%) and very obese patients (47%) compared with normal weight (40%), p<0.05\n\n\nLength of stay: very obese patients, compared with normal weight patients, showed a trend towards longer\nICU stay, median (IQ): 4.1 (1.8\u201312.1) vs. 3.1 (1.7\u20137.2), days, p = 0.06\nHospital stay: 14.3 (8.4\u201327.4) vs. 12.3 (5.1\u2013 24.4), days, p = 0.08\nMean SOFA scores during ICU stay were lower in under weight vs. normal weight patients (3.5 vs. 4.5, p<0.01)\n\n\nPost-hoc analysis\n\nIn patients who were mechanically ventilated for more than 2 days, trend towards a higher mortality in underweight patients compared with those with normal BMI: SAPS II adjusted odds ratio 1.84 (95% CI: 0.94\u20133.61, p=0.077)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nBMI does not have a significant impact on mortality in European ICU patients, although patients with higher BMI developed ICU-acquired infections more frequently\n\nStrengths\n\nLarge heterogenous population representing normal intensive care admissions (good external validity)\nInteresting epidemiological data collected regarding obese patients on intensive care\nBMI recorded in majority of patients (91%)\nVery little loss to follow up/low attrition bias (although not clearly stated)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUse of BMI:\n\nNo record of how many patients had estimated weight and height and allowing \u2018estimated BMI\u2019 may seriously effect internal validity\nBMI may not be an appropriate measure of obesity in critically unwell patients (recent weight change, volume depletion/overload)\n\n\nAuthors acknowledge there may be logistical issues with discharge of very obese patients from intensive care which may inappropriately increase length of stay\nSmall subgroup size of very obese patients (n=81)\nNo power calculation\nDid not analyse for incidence of venous thromboembolism, for which obesity is a known risk factor\nSelection bias: obese patients with more comorbidities referred to intensive care may not have been admitted. Therefore the sample may be a more medically and functionally fit cohort of obese patients (note no significant increase in incidence of diabetes and heart failure in obese groups)\nNot registered on clinicaltrial.gov\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe study is unable to conclusively say whether obesity significantly impacts on morbidity and mortality in ICU patients due to methodological problems impacting on its internal validity and lack of clarity whether sufficiently powered to detect an effect. I will continue to prognosticate and manage patients based on underlying disease process and co-morbidities rather than BMI\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Obesity is associated with increased morbidity but not mortality in critically ill patients\n[further reading]\u00a0Sepsis in European intensive care units: Results of the SOAP study\n[Further reading]\u00a0Obesity and the lung: 3 \u00b7 Obesity, respiration and intensive care\n[Further reading]\u00a0CEACCP: Intensive care management of morbidly obese patients\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@IntenseMedic\nSummary date:\u00a020th December 2015\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@davidslessor\n\n\n"
