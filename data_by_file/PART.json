JAMA 2018; 320:769-778 doi:10.1001/jama.2018.7044\nClinical Question\n\nIn adults suffering out-of-hospital non-traumatic cardiac arrest, does a strategy of airway management initially with laryngeal tube (LT) compared to endotracheal intubation (ETI) improve survival at 72 hours?\n\nBackground\n\nObservational trials have suggested endotracheal intubation is superior to supraglottic airway devices (such as laryngeal mask airway or laryngeal tube), but since most community paramedics will perform ETI less than once per year it is a skill that is hard to maintain\nThe AIRWAYS-2 trial, reported alongside this Pragmatic Airway Resuscitation Trial (PART), investigated iGel LMAs vs ETI in a UK out-of-hospital setting and found no difference in favourable neurological outcome at 90 days\n\nDesign\n\nPragmatic study specifically designed to investigate LT vs ETI as a strategy alongside existing clinical practice in a variety of out-of-hospital settings\n\nFunded specifically to be pragmatic in design, which created limitations on data collection, interventions and sample size\n\n\nCluster-randomised, multiple cross-over design\n\nParamedic / Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were the unit of randomisation, being assigned to periods of LT or ETI as the initial strategy for advanced airway management\n\n\nA priori randomisation of allocation sequence\n\nDuration of each allocation was at the request of the EMS units, with either 3 or 5 months to suit their training and implementation\nCross-overs could occur more than once and were balanced in blocks of 2\nTwo changes to the allocation sequence and cross-over timings were made during the trial to redress imbalances in recruitment numbers without the knowledge of outcome data\n\n\nThe intervention and control group were open-label\nHospital teams could intervene with airway management and managed patients at their discretion with the knowledge of cluster (treatment) allocation\nSample size calculations were based upon existing data from ROC PRIMED trial\n\nEstimated 72-hour survivals were 16.2% for ETI and 11.1% for LT, suggesting an effect size of 5.1% in favour of ETI\nAdjustments were made for a more conservative effect size, interim analyses, loss of precision due to cluster randomisation design, non-compliance (use of bag-valve-mask rather than specified device), and loss to follow-up\nFinal target sample size was set at 3000 patients, to have a trial power of 85% and a conventional overall statistical 2-sided alpha of 0.05\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n27 EMS agencies in 13 randomisation clusters producing 56 random cluster treatment group assignments\nDecember 2015 to November 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adults over 18 years; non-traumatic cardiac arrest; requiring advanced airway management or anticipated ventilatory support\nExclusion: Initial clinical care by EMS agency not engaged in the trial; major facial trauma; major bleeding; asphyxia cardiac arrest; LVAD or total artificial heart; do not attempt resuscitation or do no enroll bracelet; pregnancy; prisoners\n3,840 patients screened, with 3,004 included\nBaseline characteristics were mostly balanced (LT vs ETI, bold highlights most notable difference):\n\nMedian age: 64 vs 64 years\nWitnessed arrest: 51% vs 51%\nMedian time from dispatch to arrival: 5.0 vs 5.3 minutes\nMedian time from EMS arrival to airway management start: LT 9.8 minutes vs ETI 12.5 minutes\nShockable rhythm: 20% vs 18%\nPrehospital epinephrine: 92% vs 94%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nA strategy involving Laryngeal Tube as the initial airway management\n\nEMS agencies were instructed to use Laryngeal Tubes when attending cardiac arrests\nCombitubes, LMAs, iGels or other supraglottic devices were not allowed\nPatients were retained in this assignment group regardless of actual intervention even if only managed with bag-valve-mask\n\n\n\nControl\n\nA strategy involving Endotracheal Intubation as the initial airway management\n\nEMS agencies were instructed to perform Endotracheal Intubation when attending cardiac arrests\nConventional orotracheal intubation was preferred for initial attempt\nVideolaryngoscopy could be used\nAlternative methods (eg. nasotracheal or digital intubation) were not allowed\nPatients were retained in this assignment group regardless of actual intervention even if only managed with bag-valve-mask\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nTraining was at the discretion of the EMS agencies\nNo protocolised instruction or limit to the number of attempts\nRescue strategies included any available airway management technique at the discretion of the attending EMS crew\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: At 72 hours, the survival rate was greater in the Laryngeal Tube group compared to the Endotracheal Intubation group\n\nLaryngeal Tube group: 18.3%\nEndotracheal Intubation group: 15.4%\nAdjusted Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR): 2.9% (95% CI 0.2% to 5.6%; P = 0.04)\nNumber Needed to Treat (NNT): 35\nFragility Index (FI): 3\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nReturn of spontaneous circulation\n\nLT 27.9% vs ETI 24.3%\nARR 3.6% in favour of LT (95% CI 0.3% to 6.8%; P = 0.03)\n\n\nHospital survival\n\nLT 10.8% vs ETI 8.1%\nARR 2.7% in favour of LT (95% CI 0.6% to 4.8%; P = 0.01)\n\n\nFavourable neurological status at discharge\n\nLT 7.1% vs ETI 5.0%\nARR 2.1% in favour of LT (95% CI 0.3% to 3.8%; P = 0.02)\n\n\n\n\nIntervention characterises:\n\nInitial airway management\n\nIn LT group\n\nETI performed (with or without bag-valve-mask initially): 4.5%\nLT inserted (with or without bag-valve-mask initially): 85.4%\nBag-valve-mask only: 10.1%\n\n\nIn ETI group\n\nETI performed (with or without bag-valve-mask initially): 77.4%\nLT inserted (with or without bag-valve-mask initially): 9.2%\nBag-valve-mask only: 13.3%\n\n\n\n\nRequirement of rescue intervention (according to initial attempt regardless of group allocation)\n\nIf LT attempted: 9.7% (90.3% LT success)\nIf ETI attempted: 48.4% (51.6% ETI success)\n\n\n\n\nAdverse events (according to group allocation):\n\nMore than two attempts at airway insertion\n\nLT 4.5% vs ETI 18.9%\n\n\nUnsuccessful initial airway insertion\n\nLT 11.8% vs ETI 44.1%\n\n\nUnrecognised misplacement or dislodgment\n\nLT 0.7% vs ETI 1.8%\n\n\nInadequate ventilation\n\nLT 1.8% vs ETI 0.6%\n\n\nPneumothoraces\n\nLT 3.5% vs ETI 7.0%\n\n\nRib fractures\n\nLT 3.3% vs ETI 7.0%\n\n\n\n\nOther analyses:\n\nNo differences were identified when analysed in a priori\u00a0defined subgroups (initial rhythm, bystander witnessed, response times, BLS attender capabilities, time to airway placement, use of neuromuscular blocking drugs, age, use of videolaryngoscope, use of bag-valve-mask only, airway placement after ROSC)\nPer-protocol analysis favoured Laryngeal Tube over Endotracheal Intubation\nAs-treated analysis found no difference between the groups\nAdjusted analysis using General Estimating Equations found no difference\nFragility analysis (imputing the 4 missing outcomes as all possible options) identified that the primary outcome would not have reached significance only if all four patients survived (probability of this occurring 0.06%)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nA strategy of initial airway management with a laryngeal tube was associated with \u201cmodest but significantly\u201d improved survival at 72 hours when compared against a strategy of initial airway management with endotracheal intubation\n\nStrengths\n\nImportant question with suitable hypothesis and pragmatic methodology\nComplex but appropriate randomisation strategy to minimise between group differences in all but the intervention\nThorough and well reported statistical analysis with attempts to control for the pragmatic, cluster-randomised method\nThe hypothesis was \u201cA strategy with an initial plan of LT is better than ETI\u201d; the authors stress this was not a trial comparing LT vs ETI directly, as the EMS teams were allowed to manage the situation at their discretion\n\nAlthough this weakens the ability to conclude LT is better than ETI, it makes the conclusion more generalisable to non-research settings\nThis could be a strength or a weakness depending on how you wish to generalise the result of this trial for your clinical practice\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nCluster-randomised cross-over research method is not a conventional Randomised Control Trial and as such there may be between group differences introduced through systematic differences and not just by chance\nInternal validity may be reduced due to the lack of blinding of the intervention allocation or the lack of concealment of allocation or timings of cross-over\n\nStatistical analysis has attempted to investigate and control for these biases, but this has limitations\n\n\nAlthough the link between the intervention and the primary outcome of mortality at 72 hours has good biological plausibility, it is not particularly patient-centred nor resource-centred\nIt may not be possible to generalise beyond Laryngeal Tubes to other supraglottic devices (compare with the iGel vs ETI trial AIRWAYS-2)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial identifies that a strategy involving laryngeal tubes as the initial airway management device is probably superior to a strategy involving endotracheal intubation, in the setting of pre-hospital, non-traumatic, adult cardiac arrest\nDue to potential systematic biases, the true difference between these strategies may not be as large as the difference observed in this pragmatic, cluster-randomised, cross-over trial\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of a Strategy of Initial Laryngeal Tube Insertion vs Endotracheal Intubation on 72-Hour Survival in Adults With Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest\n[further reading]\u00a0AIRWAYS-2 summary by TBL\n[further reading]\u00a0ILCOR statement after AIRWAYS-2 and PART publication\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Duncan Chambler\nSummary date: 11 October 2018\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\n\n\n"
