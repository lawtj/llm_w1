NEJM 2021; 385: 35-45.DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2102968\nClinical Question\n\nIn children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome, what affect do different treatments have on the composite of inotropic support or mechanical ventilation by day 2 or death, and disease severity by day 2?\n\nBackground\n\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a new, rare but serious complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection with currently limited information as to the most effective treatment. A best available treatment study was performed to provide evidence for recommendations regarding the treatment of MIS-C\n\nDesign\n\nObservational cohort study\nWorldwide study\nData from patients with confirmed or suspected MIS-C was uploaded onto Web based Research Electronic Data Capture database by treating clinician\nWeighted logistic-regression methods were used in statistical analysis with weights determined by inverse probability according to covariate balancing propensity scores\nStudy approved by the UK research ethics committee\n\nSetting\n\n81 hospitals in 34 countries uploaded data\nData collected between 20th June 2020 and 24th February 2021\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Children who met the published WHO criteria for MIS-C and those with any suspected inflammatory illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection\nExclusion: Not clearly defined but 37 patient excluded due to incomplete or duplicate entries; 50 patients had data included in the baseline characteristics but were excluded from the weighted analysis as they had received immunomodulator before transfer to the reporting hospital\n651 patients enrolled with 614 meeting inclusion criteria\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs control group\n\nPatients in control group were younger, had lower rates of positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2, required more organ support at admission and had higher troponin levels\nIVIG +\nGlucocorticoids vs glucocorticoids alone vs IVIG alone\n\nMedian age: 8.8 vs 8.8 vs 7\nMale sex %: 61 vs 60 vs 64\nCo-existing illness %: 2 vs 7 vs 2\nSARS-CoV-2 +ve on PCR %: 26 vs 27 vs 15\nSAR-CoV-2 antibody +ve %: 80 vs 70 vs 68\nRequiring organ support on admission (mechanical ventilation, inotropic support or ECMO) %: 32 vs 20 vs 15\nMedian troponin ng/l: 50 vs 50 vs 18\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nTwo intervention groups based on initial immunomodulatory therapy\n\nIVIG plus corticosteroid (n=208)\nGlucocorticoids alone (n=99)\n\nOf 89 patients included in primary analysis 47 (53%) went on to receive IVIG\n\n\n\n\nAnother 22 patients received other immunomodulators, and 39 received no immunomodulatory therapy \u2013 due to low numbers these groups were not used as comparison\n\nControl\n\nIVIG alone (n=246)\n\nChosen as the reference treatment since it is the accepted treatment for Kawasaki\u2019s disease and has been widely adopted in the treatment of MIS-C\nOf 217 patients included in primary analysis 99 (46%) went on to receive steroids\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n2 primary outcomes\n\nComposite of inotropic support or mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive) by day 2 or later or death \u2013 No significant difference\n\nIVIG + glucocorticoids vs IVIG alone \u2013 adjusted odds ratio 0.77; 95% CI 0.33-1.82\nGlucocorticoids alone vs IVIG alone \u2013 adjusted odds ratio 0.54; 95% CI 0.22-1.33\n\n\nReduction in disease severity on a seven point ordinal scale between day 0 and day 2 \u2013 no significant difference\n\nIVIG + glucocorticoids vs IVIG alone \u2013 adjusted odds ratio 0.90; 95% CI 0.48-1.69\nGlucocorticoids alone vs IVIG alone \u2013 adjusted odds ratio 0.93; 95% CI 0.43-2.04\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nEscalation in the administration of immunomodulators \u2013 significantly less common in patients who received IVIG + glucocorticoids compared with IVIG alone\n\nOdds ratio 0.18; 95% CI 0.10-0.33\n\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nThe time until a reduction of one point in disease severity on the ordinal scale\nLeft ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography\nCoronary artery aneurysm after treatment\nTemporal dynamics of blood markers of inflammation and organ damage\nAny increase in cardiorespiratory supportive therapy after day 0\nDeath: 3% vs 4% vs 1%\n\n\nDrug complications were highest in patient who received glucocorticoids and were predominantly hypertension and hyperglycaemia\nSubgroup analysis \u2013 including only patients who met the WHO criteria for MIS-C\n\nIVIG + glucocorticoids vs IVIG alone \u2013 no significant differences\n\n1st primary outcome event- adjusted odds ratio 0.95; 95% CI 0.37-2.45\n2nd primary outcome event adjusted OR; 1.09 95% CI 0.53-2.23\n\n\nGlucocorticoids alone vs IVIG alone\n\n1st primary outcome event \u2013 significantly improved outcomes in glucocorticoids alone group\n\nadjusted odds ratio 0.3; 95% CI 0.10-0.85\n\n\n2nd primary outcome event \u2013 no significant difference\n\nadjusted odds ratio 1.95; 95% CI 0.83-4.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nNo evidence of substantial differences in the two primary outcomes among children who received the three most common treatments for MIS-C\n\nStrengths\n\nWorldwide study looking at treatments widely available therefore generalizable to my patient population\nPragmatic study in a newly emerging condition which currently has limited data\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNo standardisation to the standard of care patients received alongside the treatments\nNo randomisation of patients to different arms of the study\nA large number of patients who were initially treated with either IVIG or steroids, went on to have the other treatment\nLikely the sickest patients were given IVIG + glucocorticoids or immunomodulatory therapy sooner, leading to differences between the baseline characteristics between the groups\nThe baseline characteristics includes the data of 50 patients who were excluded from the primary analysis. It is unclear if there were significant differences in the baseline characteristics of these patients\nMissing data especially in laboratory values \u2013 e.g. 50% of patients did not have a troponin result uploaded for review Trends between the groups could therefore have been missed\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis paper shows no evidence of differences in the primary outcomes between different treatment groups\nIn the subgroup analysis including only patients who met the WHO criteria for MIS-C, in the glucocorticoids only vs IVIG group, there was a significant reduction in the composite of inotropic support or mechanical ventilation by day 2 or later or death. Due to methodological weaknesses and the fact that this was a subgroup analysis, this should be viewed as hypothesis generating only\nFurther prospective randomised controlled studies would be beneficial in this area\nI will continue to treat patients with a combination of these interventions seeking input from the wider multidisciplinary team whilst awaiting further data\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Treatment of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Dr Joanna Davy\nSummary date: 19th July 2021\nPeer-review editor: Dave Slessor\nPhoto by Fusion medical animation on Unsplash\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
