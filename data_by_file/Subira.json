JAMA 2019;321(22):2175-2182. doi:10.1001/jama.2019.7234\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients weaning from mechanical ventilation, does a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with pressure support (PS) for 30 minutes vs a SBT with T-piece for 2 hours differ in the rate of successful liberation from mechanical ventilation (MV)?\n\nBackground\n\nWeaning from MV accounts for up to 40% of time spent on MV and an SBT constitutes the gold standard diagnostic test to determine a patients\u2019 readiness for extubation\nCurrently used SBT modalities include methods that provide ventilatory support, such as pressure support ventilation (5-8 cm H2O with or without PEEP), CPAP or automatic tube compensation; and methods without any ventilatory support, such as T-piece\nDecades of research have been dedicated to finding the optimal protocolized SBT modality that best simulates physiologic conditions post-extubation, in order to infer a patients\u2019 readiness to liberate from MV\nRecent meta-analyses and guidance have been inconclusive or contradicting\nStudies have shown that different SBT modalities and duration demonstrate no significant difference regarding success rate of extubation (PSV vs. T-piece for 2h, 30-minute vs. 2h PSV or 30-minute vs. 2h T-piece). The optimal SBT modality and duration to ascertain a patients\u2019 readiness to be extubated remains unknown\n\nDesign\n\nMulticenter prospective randomized control trial\nRandomization was performed through a computerized random number tables and blinded blocks of 4 patients for each hospital\nAn estimated extubation success of 75%, with an increase in absolute success rate of 7%, an alpha error of 0.05 and a power of 80%, requires a sample size of 540 patients per group to detect a significant difference of successful extubation between groups\nA prespecified interim analysis was performed when half of the sample was enrolled. There was a nonsignificant difference in successful extubation between groups\nAnalysis was performed using an intention-to-treat principle\n\nSetting\n\n18 intensive care units in Spain\nJanuary 2016 to April 2017\n\nPopulation\n\n\n\nInclusion: \u2265 18 years of age, met weaning criteria after at least 24 hours of mechanical ventilation\n\nSuitable cough (Ability to raise secretions to the endotracheal tube) (or PiMax> -15 cmH2O)\nAbsence of excessive secretions (<3 aspirations in the last 8 hours)\nResolution or improvement of the pathology that led to intubation\nClinical stability (HR <140 bpm, SBP 90-160, without vasopressors or at minimum doses)\nAdequate oxygenation (SatO2> 90% with FiO2 <0.4)\nAdequate ventilatory mechanics (RR <35 rpm, MIP <-20 cmH2O, Vt> 5 ml / kg, VC> 10 ml/ kg, RR / VT <100 rpm/l)\nConfident awareness level (Glasgow Coma Scale> 13)\n\n\nExclusion: Tracheostomy, do-not-reintubate orders, decision of the responsible physician (e.g., due to a preference for a particular weaning technique according to the underlying pathology), absence of informed consent, mental incapacity without legal representation\n\n\n\n\n2649 patients were assessed for eligibility, 1153 were randomized and included in primary analysis (575 for 30-min PS SBT and 578 for 2-h T-piece SBT)\nBaseline characteristics: well-balanced for age, APACHE score on admission, reason for admission and days on MV before SBT. Most were medical ICU patients\n\nIntervention\n\nLow respiratory work strategy\n\nSpontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) with Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)\nPSV 8 cmH2O, PEEP 0 cmH2O for 30 minutes\n\n\n\nControl\n\nHigh respiratory work strategy\n\nSBT with T-piece for 2 hours\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nFiO2: maintained the same as before the SBT\nPostextubation non-invasive support: before SBT attending physician had to choose between providing ventilatory support with non-invasive ventilation or oxygenation support with high-flow nasal cannula or conventional low flow oxygen therapy\nOne-hour rest: patients could be rested for 1hr on mechanical ventilator prior to extubation\n\nThis was determined prior to randomization\n\n\nFailure of SBT Criteria\n\nNeurological causes: Agitation or anxiety. Low level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale <13)\nIncreased respiratory work: use of accessory muscles, facial expression suggesting stress, severe dyspnea\nHypoxemia: PaO2 <60 mmHg or SatO2 <90% with FiO2 >0.5\nTachypnea: RR> 35 rpm\nHemodynamic instability: HR> 140 bpm or >20% from baseline; SBP >180 mmHg or >20% from baseline; SBT <90 mmHg; Cardiac arrhythmias\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: successful extubation, defined as remaining free of MV 72 h after the first SBT, was more frequent in the low respiratory work strategy group (SBT + PSV)\n\nSBT+PSV: 82.3%\nSBT+T-piece: 74%\nAbsolute Risk Reduction (ARR): 8.2% (95% CI 3.4-13%)\nKaplan-Meier curves show a higher successful extubation rate in SBT-PSV group\n\nHazard Ratio (HR) 1.54 (95% CI 1.19-1.97; P <0.001)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome: Comparing SBT+PSV vs SBT+T-piece\n\nSuccessful extubation after first SBT: 92.5% vs 84.1%\n\nDifference: 8.4 (95% CI 4. 7 to 12.1, P <0.001)\n\n\nReintubation within 72 h: 11.1% vs 11.9%\n\nDifference: -0.8 (95% CI -4.8 to 3.1, P=0.63)\n\n\nICU length of stay: 9 days vs 10 days\n\nDifference: -0.3 (95% CI -1.7 to 1.1, P=0.69)\n\n\nHospital length of stay: 24 days vs 24 days\n\nDifference: 1.3 (95% CI -2.2 to 4.9, P=0.45)\n\n\nHospital mortality: 10.4% vs 14.9%\n\nDifference: -4.4 (95% CI -8.3 to -0.6, P=0.02)\n\n\n90-Day mortality: 13.2% vs 17.3%\n\nDifference: -4.1 (95% -8.2 to 0.01, P=0.04)\n\n\n\n\nExploratory outcome: comparing SBT+PSV vs SBT+T-piece\n\nTime to reintubation: 23 hours vs 24.5 hours\nReason for reintubation: mostly due to excessive WOB, difficulty managing secretions and refractory hypoxemia\n\nWell balanced between groups\n\n\nTracheostomy: 7.1% vs 8.7%\n\n\nPost-hoc outcome:\n\nICU mortality: 5% vs 6.6%\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong mechanically ventilated patients, an SBT consisting of 30 minutes of PSV, compared with 2 hours of T-piece ventilation, led to significantly higher rates of successful extubation\nThese findings support the use of a shorter, less demanding ventilation strategy for SBTs\n\nStrengths\n\nLargest multi-center randomized controlled trial to asses an important clinical question\nHigh adherence to specified protocol\nWell-balanced baseline participant characteristics\nAdequate methodology and sample size with sufficient power to test the trials\u2019 hypothesis\nIntention-to-treat analysis was performed\nFragility index of 21 for the primary outcome\n\nWeaknesses\n\nInvestigators were not blinded to treatment randomization group\nPost-extubation non-invasive support (HFNC or NIV) was not protocolized\n\nThe PSV 30-minute SBT received more post-extubation NIV or HFNC when compared to the T-piece 2-hour SBT (25% vs 19%; P=0.01) which could have skewed results favoring the PSV 30-minute SBT\n\n\nOne-hour rest prior to extubation was not standardized\nCurrent practice favors 30-minute SBTs\n\nTherefore, a comparison of 30-minute SBT PSV with 30-minute SBT T-piece more closely reflects current practice and generalizability\n\n\nProtocol was only applied to a patients\u2019 initial SBT\n\nTherefore, the results cannot be applied to patients who failed their first SBT (a fairly common scenario)\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA \u201cless demanding\u201d 30-minute SBT with PSV of 8 cmH2O is an efficient (more successful extubation rate) and safe (without increase in reintubation rate) initial screening SBT modality to ascertain a patients\u2019 readiness to be liberated from MV\nA \u201cmore demanding\u201d 2-hour SBT with T-piece appears to be unnecessary and associated with fewer successful extubations\nThis trial does not inform whether a 30-minute SBT with either T-piece or PSV have similar outcomes\nBased on this trial, I will continue to perform SBTs with 30-minutes of pressure augmentation support\nWhether use of T-piece SBT over PSV in selected patients (with heart failure, severe COPD and neuromuscular weakness) where pressure support might obscure a patients\u2019 ability to breathe remains unknown\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Effect of Pressure Support vs T-Piece Ventilation Strategies During Spontaneous Breathing Trials on Successful Extubation Among Patients Receiving Mechanical Ventilation: A Randomized Clinical Trial.\n[further reading] Extubation outcome after spontaneous breathing trials with T-tube or pressure support ventilation.
