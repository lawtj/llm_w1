The mechanism of action is thought to be direct binding to free virus particles leading to their neutralisation. They may also stimulate antibody-dependent phagocystosis and cytotoxicity\nSARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated by binding of the viral transmembrane spike glycoprotein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface\nCasirivimab and imdevimab and non-competitive monoclonal antibodies that bind to the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein, blocking viral entry into host cells. The use of two antibodies that bind to non-overlapping epitopes was used to try and minimise risk of resistance\nA randomised controlled study in over 4000 outpatients with COVID-19, reported that the use of REGEN-COV significantly reduced Covid-19-related hospitalisation or all-cause death\nIn December 2020 an interim analysis of a small RCT reports benefit with the use of REGEN-COV in hospitalised patients who are on low flow oxygen and are sero-negative at baseline. At time of analysis there were 217 sero-negative patients and 270 sero-positive patient included. From October 2020 the trial stopped recruiting patients who were requiring high-flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation at baseline, following a recommendation by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. These results have not yet been published\nThe RECOVERY trial continued to investigate the use of REGEN-COV in all hospitalised patients with COVID-19, regardless of severity\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled open-label platform trial\n\nWeb-based simple (unstratified) randomisation\n1:1:1 to either standard care, usual standard care plus REGEN-COVID or usual standard care + convalescent plasma (until 15th Jan 20201).\u00a0 Convalescent plasma study published separately\nAllocation concealed until after randomisation\n\n\nBaseline antibodies tested at time of randomisation\n\nPredefined assay threshold with a \u226599% sensitivity and specificity in detecting individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 20 days previously\n\n\nPatients could be simultaneously randomised to other treatment groups\n\nAzithromycin vs usual care\nColchicine vs usual care\nAspirin vs usual care\nBaricitinib vs usual care\nTocilizumab vs usual care \u2013 until 24/1/21 the trial also allowed this subsequent randomisation for patients with progressive COVID-19\n\n\nIntention to treat analysis\nParticipants and local study staff were not masked to allocated treatment\nRegistered on clinical trials.gov\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals supplied REGEN-COV and provided comments on the manuscript for consideration\n\nSetting\n\n127 UK hospitals took part in the evaluation of REGEN-COV\nData collected September 2020 \u2013 May 2021\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Clinically suspected or laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infection\nExclusion:\n\nMedical history that might in the opinion of attending clinician put the patient at significant risk\nReceived IV immunoglobulin treatment during current admission\nChildren <40kg or age <12 years\n\n\n9785 patients randomised\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nSero-negative patients\n\nAge: 63 vs 64\nMale: 61% vs 58%\nEthnicity \u2013 white: 81% vs 82%\nNumber of days since symptom onset: 7 vs 7\nNumber of days since admission to hospital: 1 vs 1\nRespiratory support received\n\nNo oxygen: 11% vs 7%\nSimple oxygen: 66% vs 65%\nNon-invasive ventilation: 20% vs 22%\nInvasive ventilation: 2% vs 2%\n\n\nCo-morbidities\n\nDiabetes: 25% vs 27%\nHeart disease: 25% v 26%\nChronic lung disease: 28% vs 30%\n\n\nPositive SARS-CoV 2 PCR test result : 97% vs 97%\nAdditional treatments given\n\nCorticosteroids received: 91% vs 92%\nTocilizumab or sarilumab: 13% vs 17%\nRemdesivir: 26% vs 28%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nREGEN-COV + usual care\n\nSingle dose of combination of 2 monoclonal antibodies (carsirivimab 4g & imdevimab 4g) by IV infusion in 250ml normal saline over 60 minutes\n90% of patients received allocated treatment\n\n\n\nControl\n\nUsual care\n\n<1% received REGEN-COV\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: 28 day mortality\n\nAssessed 1st among patient without detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at randomisation\n\nSignificantly reduced in REGEN-COV group\n\n24% vs 30% (rate ratio 0.8; 95% CI 0.70-0.91, p=0.01)\nFragility index \u2013 37 patients\nNNT 19\n\n\n\n\nSubsequently tested in whole population (patient with and without detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2)\n\nNo significant difference\n\n20% vs 21%, (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.86-1.03, p=0.17)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: Comparing REGEN-COV vs control\nIn seronegative patients\n\nProgression to non-invasive ventilation or invasive ventilation \u2013 significantly reduced\n\n28% vs 32%; RR 0.87 (0.77-0.98)\n\n\nProgression to invasive ventilation \u2013 no significant difference\n\n12% vs 13%; RR 0.88 (0.73-1.06)\n\n\nDischarged alive from hospital within 28 day \u2013 significantly greater\n\n64% vs 58%; Rate ratio 1.19 (1.06-1.30)\n\n\n\n\nIn whole population \u2013 no significant differences\n\nProgression to non-invasive ventilation or invasive ventilation\n\n23% vs 24%\n\n\nDischarged alive from hospital within 28 days\n\n70% vs 69%\n\n\n\n\n72 hour safety outcomes in all patients\n\nThrombotic event: 2% vs 1%\nSudden hypotension: 4% vs 2%\nSudden worsening in respiratory status: 21% vs 22%\nClinical haemolysis: 1% vs 2%\n7 suspected serious adverse reaction.

This is following publication of another arm of this platform trial which demonstrated a mortality benefit with tocilizumab. Although this was not a weakness of the trial design, we do not know what impact REGEN-COV would have had if all patients had received tocilizumab\nIndustry sponsor provided comments on the manuscript for consideration\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn hospitalised patients with COVID-19, the use of the REGEN-COV monoclonal antibody cocktail significantly reduced 28 day mortality in patients who did not have antibodies to COVID-19 at baseline\nThe study population were largely not critically unwell, and had usually been treated with steroids but not tocilizumab. The mortality benefit may be different in different populations. However, as this is the best available evidence when REGEN-COV is available, I will use it on sero-negative critically ill patients who will have normally received both steroids and tocilizumab\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Casirivimab and imdevimab in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial\n[further reading]\u00a0read\n[further reading]\u00a0MRHA approval\nnote MRHA dose much less\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 2nd September 2021\nPeer-review editor: Fraser Magee\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
