Classification accepted when all 3 parties agreed\nCosts and damages corrected to 2013 values using annualised retail price indices\n\nSetting\n\nAll NHS Intensive care units (including paediatric and neonatal ICUs) in England\n1995 \u2013 \u00a02012\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Claims notified to the NHSLA that were associated with intensive care\nExclusion: Claims judged to have been misclassified, not related to intensive care, claim related to care before or after ICU treatment, inadequate or uninterpretable information\n523 claims analysed of whom 210 claims excluded from final analyses\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: No primary outcome specified\nClaims by year: Number of claims increased from eight claims in 1995-1997 to 68 claims in 2003-2005. 20% of claims made\u00a0\u22654 years after incident\nMost common clinical categories of claims:\n\nPositioning/nursing standards/skin care\u00a0(predominately related to pressure sores)\u00a027.5%\nInfection 25.5% (of whom a quarter relate to the acquisition of MRSA)\nRespiratory/airway 20.1%\nPaediatrics 17.8%\nVascular access 14.1%\n\n\nClinical category with highest number of claims relating to patient death:\n\nRespiratory/airway 33\nMissed/delayed diagnosis 22\nPaediatrics 19\n\n\nClinical categories with highest number of claims associated with severe or fatal outcome:\n\nPositioning/nursing standards/skin care 80\nInfection 64\nRespiratory/airway 55\n\n\nCost of claims\n\n71.7% of 244 closed claims led to cost totalling \u00a320 million (Mean \u00a382,000, median \u00a3726,000)\nCategories in which claims most frequently led to cost:\n\nFailure to monitor or identify deterioration 81.8%\nDelayed/inadequate treatment 81.3%\nInfection 78.8%\n\n\nClinical category with highest overall costs:\n\nInfection \u00a36.6 million\nPositioning/skin care/nursing standards \u00a34.5 million\nDelayed/inadequate treatment \u00a34.3 million\nMissed/delayed diagnosis \u00a33.9 million\n\n\nClinical category with highest mean total cost per case:\n\nWithdrawn/withheld treatment \u00a3429,000\nObstetrics \u00a3164,000\nFailure to monitor/identify deterioration \u00a3162,000\n\n\nDamages to claimants accounted for 61% of all costs and payments to legal teams accounted for 39%\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nClaims following ICU care and common, costly and likely to follow a poor outcome\n\nStrengths\n\nStudy covered long time period and large number of intensive care units\nClaims classified by 3 parties with agreement. 4th consultant intensivist to adjudicate in cases of disagreement, all though this was not required\nStudy is on an area of practice that is relevant, yet poorly studied and understood by clinicians\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNumber of claims excluded due to lack of detail. In those cases that were included, the clinical details were limited as the database used is not intended for clinical analysis. Authors were unable to review clinical notes to ensure accuracy of data presented\nRetrospective review\nNo method to check if any claims had not been reported to NHSLA\nClaims that may relate to care in last few years of study may have not been made at time that data was collected\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn 17 years, \u00a320 million has been spent on claims relating to ICU care in NHS hospitals in England. The most common claims related to pressure sores followed by infection, including the acquisition of MRSA. The clinical category with the highest number of claims related to patient death was respiratory/airway followed by missed/delayed diagnosis. Intensive care units should review their practice to ensure that they have guidelines, staffing and environments that minimise the risks identified. \u00a0This study highlights the importance of good quality note keeping to enable staff to write statements on events that occurred\u00a0\u2265four years previously.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Litigation associated with intensive care unit treatment in England: an analysis of NHSLA data 1995\u20132012\n[further reading]\u00a0Difficult airway society proposed 2015 guidelines\n[further reading]\u00a0National Tracheostomy Safety Project\n[further reading]\u00a0NPSA 7 steps to patient safety\n[further reading]\u00a0NPSA definitions of levels of harm\n[further reading]\u00a0NICE guideline pressure ulcers\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 19th October 2015\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@avkwong\n\n\n"
