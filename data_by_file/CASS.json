Lancet Respiratory Medicine 2018;6(3); 183-192\nClinical Question\n\nIn septic and mechanically ventilated patients aged 50 or over, does 24 hours of induced hypothermia followed by 48 hours of normothermia improve 30-day mortality compared to routine care?\n\nBackground\n\nThe search for the \u201cmagic bullet\u201d to improve sepsis outcomes has been going on for years, with little success. Higher index of suspicion amongst clinicians and aggressive, early treatment seem to have been the key players in improving mortality\nA number of animal models have suggested therapeutic hypothermia improves sepsis outcomes:\n\nDecreased mortality in rats and rabbits\nImproved circulatory and respiratory biochemical markers in pigs\nReduced inflammatory markers and cytokines in rats\n\n\nIt is thought to work by decreasing the basal metabolic rate to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production\nThe authors of this study set out to see if therapeutic hypothermia conferred similar benefit to patients with severe sepsis or septic shock\n\nDesign\n\nMultinational, multicentre, randomised controlled open-label study\nRandomisation via an online system with computer-generated blocks stratified by age, APACHE II score and study site\nMedical staff unavoidably aware of allocation once randomised\n\nAllocation blinded to assessors\n\n\nPower calculations estimated a sample size of 560 patients to provide an 80% power at two-sided alpha level of 0.05 to detect a relative change of 21% at the upper limit of the mortality estimate\n\nMortality estimated at 40-56% based on site-specific registry data\n\n\nSensible safety checkpoints included given no similar previous work.\n\nManaged by independent safety board who were unblinded to the results\nInterim analysis after recruitment of 140, 280 and 420 patients.\nConcern regarding bleeding and coagulopathy so data assessed after the first 10 and 24 patients to review for these specific complications\n\n\nData analysed by intention-to-treat\n\nSetting\n\n10 ICUs across Denmark, the Netherlands and the USA\nNovember 2011 to November 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nAge 50 years or older\nSevere sepsis or septic shock\nMean arterial pressure (MAP) of <70mmHg\nIntubated and ventilated\nLikely ICU stay >24 hours\nEnrolled within 6 hours of meeting all the above criteria\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nPregnant or breastfeeding patients\nAny bleeding disorder/uncontrolled bleeding\nSurgery in the previous 24 hours\nPatients detained under a psychiatry order\n\n\n5695 patients screened with 436 randomised:\n\n220 to the intervention group:\n\n2 withdrew consent, 1 had underlying coagulopathy.\n14 did not complete 24 hours cooling.\nTherefore, 203 in per-protocol group and 217 in the intention-to-treat analysis.\n\n\n216 in the control group:\n\n1 withdrew consent.\nTherefore, 215 in the intention-to-treat analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nInduced hypothermia\n\nCooling and maintenance of core body temperature to 32-34\u00b0C\u00a0for 24 hours after enrollment:\n\nAim to reach target temperature within 2 hours\nAchieved using one of two external cooling systems (ArcticSun or Flex Pads) or an intravenous cooling catheter\n\n\nAfter 24 hours, patients were then slowly re-warmed to 37\u00b0C\nTemperature then maintained at 36-38\u00b0C for 48 hours\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard thermal management\n\nFor the first 24 hours, no antipyretic medication was allowed\nAfter that, routine thermal management was allowed\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nRoutine ICU care for the septic patient according the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines\n\nOutcome\n\nTrial halted early after 436 patients were recruited (78% of target) due to futility\nPrimary outcome: 30 day all-cause mortality was higher in the induced hypothermia group but not statistically significant\n\nInduced hypothermia: 44.2%\nStandard thermal management: 35.8%\nRisk Ratio (RR): 1.2 (95%CI 1.0-1.6, p=0.07)\nAbsolute Risk Increase (ARI): 8.43% (95% CI -0.78% to 17.63%; p=0.0779)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nAt day 30, the induced hypothermia group had more days with respiratory support (p=0.03), more days with renal replacement therapy (p=0.04) and more days with vasoactive medication (p=0.06).\nNo difference in ICU length of stay or 180-day mortality\nData collected at 72 hours to assess organ dysfunction:\n\nSOFA Score: no difference\n\n\n\u00a0Respiratory function: induced hypothermia group more likely to still be on a ventilator (RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.3, p=0.07)\nCirculatory function\n\nInduced hypothermia group needed more vasoactive support\n\nAccumulated vasoactive-inotropic score in\u00a0induced hypothermia group 74 vs\u00a0control group\u00a052 \u00a0(p=0.002)\n\n\n\n\nRenal function: no significant difference\nLiver function and coagulation: induced hypothermia group had more patients with a platelet count <150\u00d7109/L\n\n47.1% vs 34.3% (RR1.4,\u00a095% CI 1.1 to 1.8, p=0.01)\n\n\nHowever, the induced hypothermia group had lower platelets at baseline\nNo difference in INR or bilirubin\n\n\nCerebral function: more patients in induced hypothermia group required sedation\n\nInduced hypothermia 78.5% vs 67.7% control (RR 1.2,\u00a095%CI 1.2 to 1.3, p=0.02)\n\n\nC-reactive protein\n\nMedian CRP\n\nInduced hypothermia 106 vs 153 (mg/L) control (p=0.0001)\n\n\nReduction in CRP >30% from baseline\n\nInduced hypothermia 33.3% vs 50.3% control (p=0.001)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients aged 50 and over with septic shock and requiring mechanical ventilation, induced hypothermia for 24 hours followed by 48 hours of normothermia did not improve 30 day mortality compared to routine care\nIt also increased morbidity with more days on a ventilator and on renal replacement therapy, more vasoactive medication and increased inflammatory markers\n\nStrengths\n\nMulitnational, multicentre randomised controlled study with all inherent benefits.\nA well designed trial that tested patient-centred outcomes to try to improve the care of a cohort of patients with a high mortality\nGood method for randomisation and concealment of allocation, which reduces systematic biases\nStrong plan for interim safety analyses given this was the first trial of its size and kind\nNo loss to follow up\n\nWeaknesses\n\nTrial stopped early due to futility\n\nThis resulted in not hitting the prescribed numbers and reduces the strength of any findings\n\n\nFurthermore, there was a trend towards higher mortality in the induced hypothermia group\n\nThis was more concerning than the \u201cfutility\u201d of continuing the study to show a positive result and was possibly the key reason for halting early\n\n\nOnly included patients aged 50 or over with no real rationale as to why\n\nIf they had found a significant benefit then this would have reduced the external validity of any findings\nGiven that sepsis affects all age groups, this seems like an unnecessary step\n\n\n26 protocol violations which accounts for 11.8% of the intervention group\n\nThere were several reasons for violation but an argument could be made that some of them could have been related to the hypothermia itself\nThese should have been discussed by the authors:\n\nDied during the intervention period \u2013 12 patients\nCirculatory instability \u2013 5\u00a0patients\nEmergency surgery \u2013 4\u00a0patients\nConsent withdrawn \u2013 3\u00a0patients\nBiochemical derangement \u2013 1\u00a0patient\nBleeding \u2013 1 patient\n\n\n\n\nThe mortality of the control group (35.8%) was lower than that used in the power calculations (40-56%)\nStudy protocol banned use of antipyretics for the first 24 hours\n\nDespite a lack of evidence showing benefit of this therapy, its use in routine ICU care is widespread\n\n\nThe rate of rewarming after therapeutic hypothermia is often contested and can vary significantly between clinicians\n\nThe accepted standard is 0.25-0.5 degrees Celsius per hour\nThis study chose the upper limit of this range but given the variability in practice, the generalisability will be affected\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients over 50 with severe sepsis on a ventilator, induced hypothermia did not improve mortality or any other aspect of organ dysfunction\nIn fact, the results of this trial trend towards increased mortality and morbidity\nTaking these results alongside the inherent issues with hypothermia, not to mention the labour-intensive nature of this intervention, I will not be changing my current management of septic patients until further work proves a benefit\n\nExternal Links\n\n\n\n[article]\u00a0Induced hypothermia in patients with septic shock and respiratory failure (CASS): a randomised, controlled, open-label trial\n[further reading] Rewarming after therapeutic hypothermia\n[further reading]\u00a0LITFL \u2013 Fever, Friend or Foe\n\n\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Alex Smith\nSummary date:\u00a029th April 2018\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0Adrian Wong\n\n\n"
