Lancet 2009; 374:239-300. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60949-1\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill adults, does a single induction dose of etomidate compared to ketamine affect organ failure scores during the subsequent first 3 days?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled, prospective trial\nRandomisation by computer in blocks of 4\nStudy drug in sealed, sequentially numbered boxes\nSingle-blinded: recruiting emergency physician aware, but nurses and intensive care physicians blinded\nModified Intention-to-treat analysis (mITT) without post-randomisation exclusions \u2013 see below\n28-day follow-up period\nAimed to recruit 650 patients after complex power calculation, to allow appropriate analysis of sub-group with final diagnosis of confirmed sepsis or trauma\n\nDefined clinically relevant difference in maximum SOFA score was 2 points\nPowered at 80% \u2013 20% chance of false negative\nType-I error defined at 0.05 \u2013 5% chance of false positive\nAnticipated 30% exclusion post-randomisation (modified intention-to-treat analysis)\nEstimated sub-group of interest would be 30% of total population\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n12 French emergency medical services (EMS) or emergency departments (ED)\n\nAn EMS is an ambulance with driver, nurse and emergency doctor\n\n\n65 French intensive care units (ICU)\nApril 2007 to February 2008\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: 18 years or older; needed sedation for emergency intubation\nExclusion: cardiac arrest; contraindications to suxamethonium, ketamine or etomidate; pregnancy.\n\nPost-randomisation exclusion of those:\n\ndischarged from ICU within 3 days, \u201cto retain only the most severely ill patients\u201d\ndied before reaching hospital, \u201cbecause their death could not reasonably have been attributed to sedation use\u201d\n\n\n\n\n689 patients screened, 655 randomised, and 469 in mITT analysis\n\nIntervention\n\nKetamine (Ketalar, Panpharma)\n\n2 mg/kg intravenous bolus\n\n\n\nControl\n\nEtomidate (Lipuro, B Braun Medical)\n\n0.3 mg/kg intravenous bolus\n\n\n\n\nBoth groups received suxamethonium 1 mg/kg and then continuous infusions of midazolam (0.1 mg/kg/hr )with either fentanyl (2\u20135 mcg/kg/hr) or sufentanil (0.2\u20130.5 mcg/kg/hr)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: there was no difference in maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores between the two groups.\n\nMean SOFA scores were:\n\nEtomidate: 10.3 (SD 3.7)\nKetamine: 9.6 (SD 3.9)\n\n\nAbsolute difference (AD) was 0.7 (95% CI 0.0 to 1.4)\np-value 0.056 by generalised linear model analysis\n\n\nSecondary outcome: there were no differences in any of the secondary outcomes between the two groups\nSub-group analysis: there were no differences seen in the sub-groups of sepsis, trauma or sepsis and trauma for the primary outcome of maximum SOFA score but small sample size increase change of false-negative\n\nSepsis and trauma n=180\nSepsis n=76\nTrauma n=104\n\n\nTertiary data: basal cortisol level were lower and the proportion of patients identified as having adrenal insufficiency were higher in the etomidate group\n\nAs a subgroup analysis, ACTH test non-responders vs responders showed no difference in mortality outcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\u201cKetamine is a safe and valuable alternative to etomidate for intubation in critically ill patients, particularly in septic patients\u201d\n\nStrengths\n\nState-funded study, with no input into design, analysis or manuscript by funding body\nA priori publication of study methods and statistical plan, particularly regarding focus on sub-group analysis\nAllocation concealment was maintained, so unblinded emergency physician could not interfere with recruitment bias\nBoth modified and full intention-to-treat analyses presented for sensitivity analysis\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSince etomidate not available in some countries, findings are not applicable everywhere!\nNot entirely clear what is control\u00a0and what is intervention. Are the authors trying to prove ketamine better than usual care of etomidate, or that etomidate is more harmful? Perhaps non-inferiority design would have been better.\nDue to non-normal distribution of the primary outcome, the authors used an advanced generalised linear model analysis. This makes the meaningfulness of the result hard to interpret, which at a p-value = 0.056 it is only just statistically non-significant.\n\nConventional Student\u2019s t-test (which may not be applicable) gives p-value = 0.0467 in favour of ketamine.\n\n\nSub-group data in figure 3 missing negative sign and graphical plot does not match numerical data.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study investigates an interesting clinical dilemma and does not demonstrate any important clinical difference in organ failure scores between ketamine and etomidate when used as a single bolus for induction\nIt is my impression that the likelihood of a type II error (false negative) is high in this study and there is a trend suggesting benefit from ketamine in patients with sepsis compared against etomidate\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[abstract]\u00a0Etomidate versus ketamine for rapid sequence intubation in acutely ill patients: a multicentre randomised controlled trial\n[editorial]\u00a0Best pharmacological practice in prehospital intubation\u00a0by Wenzel and Lindner\n[correspondence]\u00a0Etomidate versus ketamine for sedation in acutely ill patients\u00a0by Mongardon and Singer\n[calculator]\u00a0SOFA Scores\n[further reading] Rapid Sequence Intubation of the Shocked Patient by LITFL\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 22 October 2014\nPeer-review editor: @DavidSlessor\n\n\n"
