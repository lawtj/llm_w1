Am J Respire Care Med; published online first 1st October 2015.\nClinical Question\n\nIn Intensive Care patients undergoing intubation does apneic oxygenation during laryngoscopy increase the lowest arterial oxygen saturation experienced by patients\n\nDesign\n\nSingle-centre, randomised controlled trial\nPermuted block generated by computerized algorithm\nAllocation concealment; sequentially-numbered opaque envelopes\nTreating clinicians non-blinded. Data collection during intubation by independent observers unaware of the study hypothesis\nPragmatic design with other treatments left to treating physicians\nSample size of 150 patients calculated to give 80% power to detect a mean lowest arterial oxygen saturation difference of 4.6%\nIntention to treat analysis\n\nSetting\n\nMedical ICU at Vanderbilt University Medical Center\nFeb 2014 to Feb 2015\nBaseline characteristics similar in both groups\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\u00a0Patients 18 years or older being intubated by a pulmonary and critical care medicine fellow in the ICU\nExclusion: Patients undergoing awake intubation, patients who required intubation so urgently that randomization could not be achieved, or if a specific approach to intra-procedural oxygenation or a specific laryngoscopy device was mandated safe for intubation (as part of a comparison of VL and DL in the same cohort).\n196 patients met inclusion criteria: 150 underwent randomisation (73 to usual care, 77 to apneic oxygenation). 46 were excluded (23 required intubation too urgently, 18 were felt to require video or FO intubation, 1 was felt to require direct laryngoscopy, 1 was felt to require apneic oxygenation, 3 excluded for unknown reasons)\n\nIntervention\n\nFor patients in the apneic oxygenation group, a high-flow nasal cannula set to 15L/min of 100% O2 was placed in the patient\u2019s nares prior to induction and kept in place until intubation was complete. Patients could be delivered additional oxygen up until the time of laryngoscopy: NRBM (32.5%), bipap (29.9%), BVM (42.9%), standard nasal cannula at 6L/min (7.8%)\n\nControl\n\nThe clinical team made decisions regarding airway management. Patients could be delivered oxygen right up until the time of laryngoscopy by NRBM (43.8%), Bipap (31.5%), BVM (42.5%) or standard nasal cannula 6L/min (2.7%)\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nApproach to pre-oxygenation, patient positioning, medications for induction & neuromuscular blockade, ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy, choice of laryngoscope blade and use of airway equipment were at the discretion of the intubating team.\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: No difference in the lowest arterial oxygen saturation measured by continuous pulse oximetry (SpO2) between induction and two minutes after successful ETT placement. The median lowest SpO2 was 92% (IQR 84-99%) [usual care] vs 90% (IQR 80-96%) [apneic O2] p=0.16\nSecondary outcome: [usual vs apneic O2] No difference in:\n\nIncidence of hypoxemia (SpO2 <90%) [47.2% vs 44.7% p=0.87]\nIncidence of severe hypoxemia (SpO2 <80%) [25% vs 15.8% p=0.22]\nIncidence of desaturation (decrease in SpO2 > 3%) [55.6% vs53.9% p= 0.87]\nChange in saturation from baseline. [4.5% vs 4% p=0.6]\n\n\nTertiary outcome:\u00a0[usual vs apneic O2]\n\nDuration of mechanical ventilation (3 vs 3 days p= 0.73)\nICU length of stay (7 vs 4 days p=0.24)\nIn-hospital mortality (49% vs 35% p=0.1)\nTime from induction to secured airway 150 seconds vs 132 seconds (p=0.31)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nApneic oxygenation does not appear to increase lowest arterial oxygen saturation during endotracheal intubation of critically ill patients compared to usual care\n\nStrengths\n\nWell designed, pragmatic study that examines a low cost and potentially effective intervention that has been widely adopted but only tested in small randomised controlled trials in the operating room and not in a critical care setting.\nThe pragmatic design meant patients could receive other forms of oxygenation up until the time of laryngoscopy. This is an accurate reflection of what happens in the real world of critical care intubations.\nThe patient\u2019s were unwell and primarily intubated for respiratory failure which is exactly the right group to test this intervention in\nStatistical analysis plan was made publicly available prior to enrolment.\nIntention to treat analysis of the primary outcome\nResults were consistent after a multivariate linear regression analysis\nThe lowest saturation between induction and two minutes after successful ETT placement takes into account a lag for the SpO2 to fall following successful intubation\nThe data collectors were unaware of the study hypothesis so probably free of bias\n\nWeaknesses\n\nA small trial with a surrogate primary outcome. A much larger trial would be required to detect a clinical outcome such as hypoxemic arrest in the peri-intubation period\nOne of the exclusion criteria was \u2018felt to require video or fibreoptic intubation\u2019. This is because the trial was trying to answer two questions at once. I worry that the 18 patients excluded due to this reason were perhaps sicker or deemed difficult intubations \u2013 again this is the group of patients that apneic oxygenation would be most useful.\nSingle centred, medical ICU limiting external validity\nThe intubators were fellows, so presumably quite adept, as is reflected in the very brief times to intubation. This intervention cannot be discounted if the operator is less experienced.\nThe lag in decrease in SpO2 may be longer than 2 minutes following intubation in some cases\nThe majority of patients received some form of supplemental oxygen from time of induction to laryngoscopy, so this trial does not answer the question for those patients where this is contraindicated. (73% received Bipap or BVM)\nThe median highest FiO2 in the preceding 6 hours was 40%. Apneic oxygenation would be expected to assist if the patient had a high FiO2 at the time of intubation and this may explain why a treatment effect has not been observed in this study as profoundly hypoxemic patients are underrepresented.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn this medical ICU, where patients were being intubated by experienced fellows, and where the operator did not think that video laryngoscopy was essential, apneic oxygenation did not increase lowest arterial oxygen saturation compared to usual care. No harm was demonstrated.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0The FELLOW trial: Randomized Trial of Apneic Oxygenation during Endotracheal Intubation of the Critically Ill\n[further reading]\u00a0PREOXYFLOW trial\n[further reading]\u00a0TBL Review of PREOXYFLOW trial\n[commentary] RebelEM Review of FELLOW trial\n[podcast] EMCrit Podcast 158\n[further reading] Stemlyn\u2019s Blog\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @CeliaBradford\nSummary date: 14 October 2015\nPeer-review editor: @DavidSlessor\n\n\n"
