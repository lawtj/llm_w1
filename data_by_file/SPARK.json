J Crit Care 2017;epublished July 12th. doi:\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients, with mild renal failure, does furosemide infusion compared to placebo worsen kidney function?\n\nBackground\n\nFurosemide is commonly used in ICU patients with 60-70% of patients with AKI receiving diuretics\nThe rationale for using diuretics includes prevention of tubular obstruction, reduction in medullary oxygen consumption and increase in renal blood flow as well as reducing fluid overload and venous congestion\nThere is controversy as to whether this is helpful of harmful in this setting with trials providing conflicting results\nFour RCTs in patients with established renal failure have not shown improvement in clinically meaningful endpoints and there are risks of harm including hearing loss\nStudies in patients with RISK RIFLE AKI are lacking and of poor quality\nThere is also variation in practice between centres and between individual clinicians\nA positive fluid balance is associated with a worse outcome in the ICU patient\nIt is not known if furosemide can change this risk.\n\nDesign\n\nPilot, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial\nPhase 2 trial \u2013 testing effectiveness and safety\nMulticentre (3 ICUs)\nRandomization 1:1, blocks of variable size (4-8), stratified for site and presence of sepsis\nBlinding of study investigators and treating clinicians\nStudy infusion bags of furosemide and placebo appeared identical\nA sample size of 214 patients was required to provide 80% power of detecting a 20% absolute reduction in the proportion who progress from RIFLE RISK class\n\nOnly 73 patients were recruited prior to early termination due to:\n\nStudy staff seconded to assist with pandemic influenza 2009\nDrug shortages\n\n\n\n\nStatistical analysis was by intention to treat\n\nSetting\n\n3 University affiliated hospitals: Canada (1) and Australia (2)\nStudy conducted between September 2009 and June 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nRISK RIFLE category AKI (Creatinine x1.5 baseline or UO < 0.5ml/kg/hr for 6 hours)\nPeripheral or central catheter + urinary catheter\n>/= 2 Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria\nImmediate resuscitation goals met; fluid resuscitated or vasoactive agents commenced\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nAge <18 years\nPregnancy (confirmed/suspected)\nObstructive etiology of AKI\nESKD on dialysis or transplant\nRecent RRT\nRecovering AKI (25% decrease in Cr)\nAcute pulmonary oedema requiring urgent furosemide\nPatient already on furosemide infusion\nMoribund/expected to die within 24 hours or limits of medical therapy\nPrior enrolment\n\n\nBaseline demographics were similar between groups although those in the furosemide group had more exposure to vancomycin (67.6% vs 38.9%).\n\nIntervention\n\n2000mg of furosemide was put in 500ml of normal saline. A loading dose of 0.4mg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.05mg/kg/h. The infusion was titrated to achieve a urine output of 1-2ml/kg/hr (maximum 0.4mg/kg/hr)\n\nThe infusion ran for 24 hours at a minimum to 7 days maximum\nThe infusion was discontinued if kidney recovery occurred, RRT was commenced, death, adverse reaction attributable to study drug, ICU discharge\n\n\n\nControl\n\nAn identical bag of 500ml normal saline was hung and run with the titration to urine output as above\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nOther aspects of patient management were left to the discretion of the treating clinicians\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: worsening of AKI as defined by progression of RIFLE category from RISK to a more severe category (INJURY, FAILURE, RRT) in the 7 days after randomization\n\nThere was no difference in the primary endpoint of worsening AKI between furosemide and placebo groups\n\nFurosemide 43.2% vs Placebo 37.1%\nOdds Ratio (as reported in paper)\u00a01.52 (95% CI 0.61 to 3.83, P = 0.48)\nAbsolute Risk Increase 7.13% (95% CI -15.25% to +29.52%, P = 0.63)\n\n\nThere was no difference in the subgroup with sepsis or when a multivariate analysis was performed taking into account vancomycin exposure, APACHE II score, pre-randomization furosemide or oliguria.\n\n\nSecondary outcome: cumulative fluid balance, serum K+/Mg++, acid-base status, rates of RRT, rates of renal recovery, hospital mortality\n\nThere was no statistical difference across secondary endpoints, although patients who received furosemide had 1081ml less in cumulative fluid balance\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nA furosemide infusion compared to placebo did not change the incidence of progression to a worse degree of kidney injury\n\nStrengths\n\nRCT, multicenter, allocation concealment, double blinding\nComplete data for primary endpoint\nIntention to treat analysis\nAn important clinical question based on a sound pharmacological mechanism\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnderpowered\nEarly termination increasing the chance of a Type I error\n30.6% of patients in the placebo arm received supplementary furosemide (compared to 10.8% in the treatment group)\nThe study is limited to those with RISK category RIFLE AKI and may not apply to those with other degrees of renal dysfunction\nThe use of furosemide may benefit some types of renal failure, eg ATN vs renal hypoperfusion but this trial was not large enough to explore this\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial does little to add to my clinical approach to using furosemide in patients with acute kidney injury\nThe small size and methodological flaws make conclusions difficult to reach\nThe impact of furosemide therapy on fluid balance is likely the most important consideration and I will continue to give a test bolus dose of furosemide to patients like this and be encouraged to use further diuretics if they have a good diuresis after the test dose\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0The SPARK study: The effect of low-dose furosemide in critically ill patients with early acute kidney injury: A pilot randomized blinded controlled trial\n[further reading]\u00a0Development and standardization of a furosemide stress test to predict the severity of acute kidney injury\n[further reading]\u00a0Acute Kidney Injury: life in the fastlane\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford\nSummary date: 2 August 2017\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
