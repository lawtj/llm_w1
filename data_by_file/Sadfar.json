Crit Care Med 2014; 42(7): 1703-13\n\n\nClinical Question\n\n\nDoes chlorhexidine-impregnated dressing compared to conventional site care prevent catheter-related blood stream infections and catheter colonisation?\n\n\nDesign\n\n\nSearch strategy\n\nSearch engines: Pubmed, Medline, Embase and \u00a0Web of Science\nKeywords: \u201cchlorhexidine, dressing, sponge, central venous catheter, arterial catheter, bacteremia, bloodstream infection\u201d\nDates: Up to date October 2012\n\n\n\n\nData extraction\n\nThree independent investigators\n\n\nStudy quality\n\nAssessed in line with Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews\nRisk of bias was reported as low/high\n\n2 studies (with haem/onc patients) thought to be high risk due to increased risk of baseline infection and non-standard infection control risk practices.\nAll other studies were deemed to be at low risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation\n\n\nInclusion criteria\n\nprospective randomised controlled trial\nprovide microbiologically based definition for\u00a0\u00a0catheter-related blood stream infections (CRBSI)\u00a0and systematically report the prevalence of\u00a0CRBSI in both intervention and control goup\n\n\nExclusion criteria: case-control, retrospective, non-randomised\nPrimary search yielded 505 citations, 9 studies chosen\n\nStudy population: 4 adult ICU, 1 paeds ICU, 1 neonatal ICU, 2 Haem/oncology, 1 adults- not specified.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n\n\nChlorhexidine-impregnated dressing for intravascular catheter\n\n\nControl\n\n\nConventional site care for intravascular catheter\n\nocclusive dressing in 8 studies, and no dressing in 1 study\n\n\n\nIn both intervention and control groups:\n\n\nCatheter types were variable; CVC alone, CVC+ arterial/pulmonary catheter, CVC+ tunnelled CVC, long term tunnelled CVC.\nStudies also varied in skin antiseptic measures, dressing change interval and duration of catheter in situ\n\n\nResults\u00a0\n\n\nPrimary outcome\u00a0\u2013 Catheter related blood stream infections \u2013 significantly less in chlorhexidine group vs. control\n\n1.1% vs 2.1%\n\n\nSecondary outcome \u2013 Catheter colonisation \u2013 significantly less in chlorhexidine group\n\n7 studies presented this data\n\n\nSub-group analysis\n\nHaematological malignancy (2 studies)-\u00a0significantly less in chlorhexidine group\nAdult ICU populations (5 studies)-\u00a0significantly less in chlorhexidine group\nPaediatric population (2 studies)- no significant difference\naverage duration of catheters >2/52 (3 studies)- no significant difference\naverage duration of catheters <2/52 (5 studies)-\u00a0significantly less in chlorhexidine group\n\n\nOther relevant outcomes\n\nNo real data on chlorhexidine resistance\nContact dermatitis was the most common adverse event\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors Conclusions\n\n\nChlorhexidine impregnated dressing significantly reduced catheter colonisation and catheter related blood stream infections\nMay not be of value for long term (>2 weeks) catheters.\n\n\nStrengths\n\n\nAuthors established expertise in this area.\nAppropriate primary and secondary outcome measures.\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\n\nLack of robust search strategy\nUnclear risk of bias assessment \u2013 most studies are at risk as none were double-blinded. One large study was only published as an abstract, but was deemed as low risk. Cochrane risk of bias tool was not utilised.\nSignificant clinical and statistical heterogeneity of studies included.\nOnly four adult ICU studies: one very small study, one study with very high baseline infection rate and two large studies from one group which contributed the majority of the data for the meta-analysis.\nNo cost analysis.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\nThis meta-analysis indicates that chlorhexidine impregnated dressing may reduce catheter related blood stream infections. However, the analysis was limited by significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity.\n\n\nFor adult ICU patients, this meta-analysis was rather unhelpful. Only two studies may be directly comparable to the generic ICU population and had low baseline CRBSI rates. However, both of these publications were by the same group with different preparations of chlorhexidine dressings. In one study, the initial skin preparation was either alcoholic chlorhexidine or alcoholic povidone- iodine based but, no subgroup analysis was made to differentiate any difference between these two skin preparations. Other study only used alcoholic providone-iodine based skin preparation.\n\n\nIt is difficult to translate these results to centres with a lower baseline CRBSI rate (<1 per 1000 catheter days), using 2% chlorhexidine-based skin preparation.\n\nExternal Links\n\n\n[Article abstract]\u00a0Chlorhexidine-impregnated dressing for prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infection: a meta-analysis\n[Original review]\u00a0Portsmouth ICU Journal Club\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Dr A Dushianthan (Portsmouth Journal Club Coordinator:\u00a0@MikeW_J)\nSummary date: 21st September 2014\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@davidslessor\n\n\n"
