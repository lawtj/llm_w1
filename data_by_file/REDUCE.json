These findings support the use of a 5-day glucocorticoid treatment in acute exacerbations of COPD.\n\nStrengths\n\nStudy population reflective of the type of patient we see\nRandomised, blinded, placebo-controlled\nExplanation for use of intravenous methylprednisolone provided (to facilitate administration of glucocorticoids to patients in distress)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNon inferiority trial \u2013 not powered to detect difference in treatment groups\nStandard treatment (including antibiotics) for all COPD patients regardless of infective cause or degree of COPD severity (although trial population had higher rate of severe/very severe spectrum of COPD).\nOnly followed up for 6 months\n40 mg methylprednisolone is equivalent to 50mg prednisolone but further titration would have proved difficult\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIt has always been my practice to prescribe short courses of steroids in COPD exacerbations and this study reinforces it.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[open access pdf of article] The REDUCE Randomized Clinical Trial\n[Editorial] Sin.
