BJA 2015 doi: 10.1093/BJA/aev399\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients undergoing internal jugular cannulation under ultrasound guidance, does the use of an oblique compared to short- and long-axis approach increase success rate and decrease complications?\n\nDesign\n\nSingle centre, prospective, randomised study\nUnblinded\nRandomisation by computer-generated number list\nFollowed up until catheter removed with all tips sent for culture\nPower calculation based on assumption of 60% first needle pass cannulation in Short Axis (SAX) group and to detect a 20% difference between the groups\n\nalpha-level 0.05, 80% power\n70 patients per group required\n\n\nIntention-to-treat analysis\n\nSetting\n\nSingle hospital in Spain\nApril 2012 \u2013 March 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n18 years and above\nIndication for IJV cannulation\n\n\nExclusion:\n\n<18 years\nHistory of previous surgical intervention at the cannulation site\nPresence of a CVC during the past 72 hours (in the same vein as the cannulation was planned)\nInfection, haematoma or surgical emphysema close to the puncture site\nRecent cervical trauma with present neck immobilisation\nAltered haemostasis (INR >2, platelet count < 50,000)\nAgitated or uncooperative patient\nCannulation planned to be performed outside of the surgical area\nUrgent cannulation\n\n\n231 patients screened, 220 randomised\n\nCommon intervention\n\nPerformed by three anaesthetists\n\nStructured training programme: 2 hour lecture, 1 hour beside teaching, 1 hour supervised practice using phantom\nPreviously had 10 successful cannulations in each of the three views\n\n\nLinear array probe\nPerformed either in theatre or post-anaesthetic care unit\nFull asepsis.\nReal-time ultrasound guidance\nSeldinger technique for CVC insertion\nChest radiograph performed to assess position of catheter and presence of complications\n\nShort-axis (SAX)\n\nProbe placed transversely over neck\nNeedle introduced in a plane perpendicular to long-axis of transducer\n\nLong-axis (LAX)\n\nProbe place longitudinally over neck\nNeedle introduced underneath footprint of probe following its long axis\n\nOblique-axis (OAX)\n\nSAX first obtained\nProbe rotated to a position midway between SAX and LAX view\nNeedle introduced underneath footprint of probe aiming from lateral to medial\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nFirst needle pass cannulation rate (needle pass was considered as any forward movement of needle without any backward movement, irrespective of skin puncture)\n\nHigher 1st pass success rate in OAX vs LAX (OR 3.7, CI 1.71-8)\nHigher 1st pass success rate in SAX vs LAX (OR 2.37, CI 1.16-4.86)\nNo difference between OAX and SAX\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nNumber of needle passes until successful cannulation\n\nMore needle passes required in LAX vs OAX\nMore needle passes required in LAX vs SAX\nNo difference between OAX and SAX\n\n\nCannulation time measured in seconds\n\nLonger cannulation time in LAX vs SAX\n\n\nIncidence of mechanical complications (including arterial puncture, posterior wall puncture, pneumothorax and haemothorax)\n\nHigher complication rate in SAX compared to LAX and OAX\nCommonest complication was puncture through the posterior wall\n\n\nIncidence of catheter-related bloodstream infection\n\n2 in LAX group but not statistically significant\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nOAX and SAX are better than LAX in terms of cannulation quality outcomes and that OAX is a safe and effective approach to performing IJV cannulation and should be encouraged\n\nStrengths\n\nComprehensive training programme for operator\nClear definition of what constitutes a needle pass\nAnalysis between operators\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSmall number of operators already experienced and accredited in ultrasound-guided IJV cannulation\nElective setting\nVast majority of insertions (87%) performed in anaesthetised patients\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study confirms the view that ultrasound-guided IJV cannulation is quicker and technically less demanding in SAX compared to LAX but is associated with greater risk of complication. OAX is a relatively less well-known approach which has the potential to combine the advantages of SAX and LAX but requires further evaluation and training.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Randomized comparison of three transducer orientation approaches for ultrasound guided internal jugular venous cannulation\n[further reading]\u00a0AAGBI Safer Vascular Access 2016\n[further reading]\u00a0The oblique view: an alternative approach for ultrasound-guided central line placement\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Adrian Wong\nSummary date:\u00a026 October 2016\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
