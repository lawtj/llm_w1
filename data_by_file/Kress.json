N Engl J Med 2000; 342:1471-1477.\nClinical Question\n\nIn medical patients who are intubated, mechanically ventilated and sedated by a continuous infusion of drugs, do daily sedative interruptions reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation or length of stay?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled clinical trial\n2\u00d72 factoria design: sedation breaks (yes/no) and sedative agent (midazolam+morphine / propofol+morphine)\nRandomised by computer and sealed in envelopes\nBlinding:\n\nSedation break \u2013 single-blinded (investigators aware);\nSedative agent \u2013 open label, non-blinded\n\n\nIntention-to-treat basis for analysis\nMethod of recruitment (sequential, random or selective etc) not specified\n\nSetting\n\nA single university-associated medical intensive care unit (ICU) in USA\nDates of recruitment not specified\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Intubated and ventilated patients deemed to require sedation by continuous infusion\nExclusion: Pregnant women, transferred from outside institutions, or post- cardiac arrest\n150 patients\n\nIntervention\n\nFrom 48 hours after commencing sedation, daily interruption of sedative and morphine were performed by an investigator (who was not directly providing patient care) until:\n\npatient was awake and could follow instructions;\nor they became uncomfortable or agitated and were deemed to require the resumption of sedation\n\n\nSedation restarted at half previous rate and titrated\n\nTarget of sedation Ramsay Sedation Scale 3 or 4 by nurse adjustment of infusion\n\n\n\nControl\n\nAdjustments were left to the discretion of the intensive care team\n\nTarget of sedation Ramsay Sedation Scale 3 or 4 by nurse adjustment of infusion\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcomes: favoured sedation breaks or showed no difference\n\nDuration of mechanical ventilation was significantly reduced in intervention group. Median days 4.9 [IQR 2.5\u20138.6] vs 7.3 [3.4\u201316.1]. RR of extubation 1.9 (95% CI 1.3\u20132.7; p<0.001)\nLength of ICU stay was significantly shorter in the intervention group. Median days 6.4 vs 9.9. RR of discharge 1.6 (95% CI 1.1\u20132.3; p=0.02).\nLength of hospital stay showed no difference: median days 13.3 vs 16.9 (p=0.19)\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nPatients were \u2018awake\u2019 on more days in the intervention group: 85.5% versus control 9.0% [p<0.001]\nFewer diagnostic tests were required for the intervention group: 6 (4.4%) vs control 16 (27%) [p=0.88]\nNo difference in accidents (ETT or CVC removal): intervention 3 (4.4%) vs control 4 (6.7%)\nNo difference in re-intubation: intervention 12 (18%) vs control 18 (30%) [p=0.17]\nNo difference in tracheostomy: intervention 12 (18%) vs control 16 (27%) [p=0.31]\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nDaily interruption of the infusion of sedative drugs is a safe and practical approach to treating patients receiving mechanical ventilation. It decreases the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, the dose of benzodiazepines used and improves the ability to perform clinical neurological examination (reducing special investigations).\n\nStrengths\n\nPragmatic study of a common problem\nAppropriate randomisation method\n\nWeaknesses\n\nMedical ICU only, so may not be generalisable to surgical or trauma patients\nLack of blinding of physician will strongly bias result toward positive outcome\nUsual practice on this ICU is not stated. If sedation breaks are usual practice, this may produce a more positive outcome since it is familiar to nursing staff\nAlthough \u201cintention-to-treat\u201d stated, this was modified: patients that died or were extubated in initial 48 hours (i.e. did not reach start of intention / control period) were excluded from analysis. Pragmatic and unlikely to bias outcome in either direction. However, it reduces generalisability to the very sick (died within 48 hours) or very well (extubated within 48 hours) cohorts of patients.\n\nn=7 (9%) in intervention group; n=16 (21%) in control group.\n\n\nSome control patients had interruptions in sedation on days other than the final day of administration (i.e. a break in sedation). This will bias the result toward no difference seen.\n\nn=18 (30%)\n\n\nThere was a difference between groups in the numbers that did not awaken from coma\n\nIntervention group 7 (10%) versus control group 15 (25%) [p=0.05].\nThis statistical level would suggest unlikely (5%) to be due to random chance and therefore likely (95%) due to intervention / control difference. This is a striking conclusion and is clinically unlikely: do sedation breaks reverse \u2018irreversible\u2019 coma?!\nThis emphasises the problem of drawing conclusions from probability statistics! The authors don\u2019t comment on this.\n\n\nTarget sedation (Ramsay Sedation Scale 3 or 4) was responsive to commands or stimulus, not calm, orientated and cooperative (Ramsay 2).\n\nThis target may be deeper than current clinical practice.\nResults and conclusion may not be generalisable to ICUs that target Ramsay 2 or RASS 0.\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn ICUs (especially medical ICUs) that target moderate depths of sedation (Ramsey \u2265 3 or RASS \u2264 -1) with continuous infusions or drugs, daily sedative interruptions will probably reduce the period of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay.\nI believe the methodological flaws in this study exaggerate the positive effect size, and it is underpowered to say that daily sedative interruptions are safe and without psychological harm.\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf / abstract / doi: 10.1056/NEJM200005183422002\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\nHeffner.
