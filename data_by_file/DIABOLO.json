JAMA 2016; 315 (5):480-488. doi:10.1001/jama.2016.0019\nClinical Question\n\nDoes acetazolamide reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and metabolic alkalosis?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled, double blinded multi-centre study\nIntention to treat analysis\nCentralised computer generated allocation with 1:1 randomisation and stratified for centres, pre-admission respiratory status and illness severity\nBaseline characteristics: mean age 69 years; male preponderance (72%); Similar SAPS II (mean 50) and SOFA Scores (mean 7.2); requirement for invasive ventilation was pneumonia in > 80%; laboratory measurements at inclusion were all similar\nSample size calculated a priori.\u00a0380 patients were required to achieve 80% power to detect\u00a0\u00a0a 15% relative risk reduction in primary outcome measure with\u00a0the use of acetazolamide (based on preliminary study)\n\nSetting\n\n15 ICUs in France\nOctober 2011 \u2013 July 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: age > 18 years of age with history of COPD receiving mechanical ventilation via endotracheal or tracheostomy tube for < 24 hours; pure or mixed metabolic alkalosis (serum bicarbonate >26mEql/L and arterial > pH 7.35)\n\nCOPD defined according to American Thoracic Society\nBaseline respiratory status prior to hospitalisation: no respiratory assistance, oxygen requirement, NIV, tracheostomy, or ventilation with tracheostomy\n\n\nExclusion: pregnancy, cystic fibrosis or diffuse bronchiectasis, previous allergy to acetazolamide or sulfonamides, recent participation in another study requiring ventilation, not for resuscitation order.\n380 patients\n\nIntervention\n\nAcetazolamide for a maximum of 28 days\n\n500 mg twice daily or 1000mg intravenously twice daily if concomitant loop diuretic administration\n27% of patients were also receiving loop diuretics\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo (saline) for a maximum of 28 days\n\nEquivalent volume of saline as the intervention group administered twice daily intravenously\n\n\n\nManagement Common to Both Groups\n\nReadiness to wean from ventilator was defined according to the criteria of the\u00a06th International Consensus Conference on ICM (2005). Weaning strategy consisted of:\n\nready to wean based on following criteria\n\nresolution of the factor triggering the acute respiratory insufficiency; no sedation and GCS > 12; absence of excessive tracheal/bronchial blockage and an effective cough reflex; haemodynamic stability, temperature <38.5C, systolic blood pressure 90-160mmHg\n\n\nprogressive decrease of pressure-support or volume-assisted ventilation with progressively longer times on a T-piece\npatients were extubated when they tolerated, for at least one hour, a spontaneous breathing trial via a T-piece with the same inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) used during mechanical ventilation\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: No statistical difference in the median duration of invasive ventilation between groups\n\n136.5 hours (IQR 68.7 \u2013 234.7 hours) in the acetazolamide group vs. 163.0 hours (IQR 86.2 \u2013 242.9 hours) in the placebo group; P=0.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nDaily median serum bicarbonate change (mEq/L)\n\nReduction in bicarbonate in acetazolamide group: -0.3 vs. 0.3; P=<0.001\n\n\nMedian number of days with a metabolic alkalosis was fewer in acetazolamide group\n\n2 vs 4 days; P=<0.001\n\n\nDaily median PaO2:FiO2 ratio change (mmHg)\n\nIncreased in acetazolamide group: 7.8 vs. 3.5; P=0.009\n\n\nDaily median change of respiratory parameters\n\nNo statistical difference between groups in tidal volume, respiratory rate or minute volume\n\n\nOther secondary outcomes: no statistical difference\n\ndaily median change of PaCO2 and pH\nduration of weaning off invasive ventilation\nnumbers of spontaneous breathing trials\nuse of tracheostomy or noninvasive ventilation after extubation\nsuccessful weaning rates (invasive ventilation not required 48 hours after extubation)\ndays of metabolic alkalosis\nunplanned extubations\nventilator-associated pneumonia episodes\nother laboratory parameter values\nICU length of stay\nICU Mortality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong patients with COPD receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, the use of acetazolamide, compared with placebo, did not result in a statistically significant reduction in the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation\n\nStrengths\n\nTrial registered criticaltrials.gov (NCT01627639)\nRandomised controlled trial\nMulticenter\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nStudy drugs were prepared and blinded in pharmacy. Acetazolamide was supplied as a freeze-dried powder but was reconstituted in saline in pharmacy and then administered immediately on ICU. The placebo was administered in the same manner\nBaseline laboratory measurements were well matched\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPresence of mixed metabolic alkalosis in the majority of patients\nOther factors may have influenced the discontinuation of mechanical ventilation e.g age, airflow limitation, long-term glucocorticoid use, diaphragm atrophy, nutritional status and clinical course\u00a0(although there were no baseline imbalances so these factors are probably nullified by the randomisation and stratification of patients by \u2018respiratory status of patients before hospitalisation\u2019)\nA 16 hour difference may be of clinical significance and it is possible the trial was underpowered to detect a statistical difference..\nThe degree of metabolic alkalosis at baseline was mild (bicarbonate 26mmol/L, pH7.32) and thus the clinical effect of acetazolamide may be difficult to assess as these patients do not have profound metabolic disturbance\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAcetazolamide administered to patients with\u00a0COPD and a metabolic alkalosis (primary or mixed), receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, does not result in a statistically significant reduction in the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation. I will continue not to use acetazolamide in this patient group.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[abstract]\u00a0Effect of Acetazolamide vs Placebo on Duration of Invasive Mechanical Ventilation Among Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\u00a0\n[further reading]\u00a0Acetazolaminde.
