J Health Serv Res Policy, published online first May 6, 2016 doi:10.1177/1355819616649630\nClinical Question\n\nPatients admitted as an emergency at the weekend have higher mortality rates compared to patients admitted on weekdays. Does the admission of fewer and/or sicker patients at the weekend compared with a weekday, account for this mortality rate difference?\n\nDesign\n\nRetrospective observational study\nPatients followed up for 30 days\nData collected from Hospital Episode Statistics\nStatistical analysis\n\nT-test used to compare attendances and deaths by day of week\nLogistic regression used to estimate \u2013 30 day mortality\nIn patients admitted via Accident and Emergency (A&E), model adjusted for: age, sex, ethnicity, diagnosis, arrival mode, first or follow-up visit, incident location, accident type, referral source, deprivation quintile, month, hospital attended\nIn patients admitted without going through A&E, model adjusted for: age, sex, ethnicity, diagnosis, co-morbidity, admission method, admission source, deprivation quintile, month, hospital\nC statistic used to summarise the goodness of fit of the models\nEach day compared with Wednesday\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nAll 140 non-specialist acute hospital trusts in England\nApril 2013 \u2013 February 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria: All admissions\nExclusion criteria: None\n12,670,788 A&E attendances; 4,656,586 emergency admissions; 772 records excluded as risk-adjusted variables missing\n\nCases\n\nPatients admitted at the Weekend\n\nControl\n\nPatients admitted on a Wednesday\n\nOutcome\n\nA&E attendances:\n\nAverage number of people attending A&E is highest on Monday and lowest of Friday (41,416 vs. 36,426)\nNumber of people that attend on a weekend day vs. a weekday \u2013 no significant difference (38,254 vs. 37,812)\n30 day Crude Mortality following A&E attendance is significantly lower in patients who present at the weekend vs. a weekday (0.99% vs. 1.03%)\nRisk adjusted 30 day mortality\n\nNo significant difference in patients that attend on a weekday vs. weekend (Odds ratio 1.02, 95% C.I. 0.997-1.022)\nModel strongly predictive of mortality \u2013 C statistic 0.92\nComparing individual days, patients attending on a Sunday or a Monday had a significantly increased mortality compared with a Wednesday\n\nWith an extra 1 in every 2941 patients dying who presented on a Sunday, and an extra 1 in 2703 patients dying who presented on a Monday\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmissions via A&E departments:\n\nThe proportion of patients attending A&E that are admitted is significantly lower in patients presented at the weekend vs. weekday (27.5% vs. 30%)\nThe crude mortality at 30 days is significantly higher in patients admitted at the weekend vs. weekday (3.59% vs. 3.42%)\nThe risk adjusted mortality was significantly higher in patients admitted at the weekend vs. weekday (Odds ratio 1.054, 95% C.I. 1.040-1.069)\nRisk adjusted model was strongly predictive of mortality with a C-statistic of 0.91\n\n\nDirect admissions:\n\nThe number of admissions on a weekday was dramatically higher than on a weekend day (3402 vs. 1317)\nComparing patients admitted on a weekend vs. weekday\n\nSignificantly more likely to be a child, young adult or age >90\nMost common primary diagnosis was influenza, abdominal pain, intestinal infections, vs. abdominal pain, influenza and headache\nSignificantly less likely to have most of the co-morbidities listed\n\n\nCrude mortality was significantly higher in patients admitted at the weekend vs. weekday (2.72% vs. 2.37%)\nRisk adjusted mortality\n\nSignificantly higher in patients admitted at the weekend vs. weekday (Odds ratio 1.212, 95% C.I. 1.162-1.263)\nModel to predict mortality had a C-statistic of 0.92\nAn extra 1 in every 204 patients died who were directly admitted at the weekend vs. a weekday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThere are fewer deaths following hospital admissions at weekends. Higher\u00a0mortality rates are found only among the subset of patients who are admitted\n\nStrengths\n\nLarge, multi-centre study\nAppropriate statistical analysis\nA priori specified subgroup analyses\nRisk adjustment models with high accuracy based on C statistics\nVery few patients excluded\n\nWeaknesses\n\nLike other papers (Freemantle et al) this paper cannot demonstrate\u00a0causality- it shows associations only\nRoughly 30% of patients were admitted, which means roughly 70% of\u00a0them were discharged. With no data on out of hospital deaths in this\u00a0study, this can be seen as 70% of patients being lost to follow up\nThere is no mention of controlling for readmission. Were they counted as\u00a0separate attendances or as a single attendance?\nRisk model did not directly include level of patient sickness, relying\u00a0on parameters such as age, sex and coded diagnosis- as opposed to physiological or biochemical parameters such as would be included in APACHE II, NEWS, or SOFA\n~47% of patients attending A&E had a diagnosis \u201cnot classifiable\u201d or\u00a0\u201cmissing\u201d This will introduce\u00a0bias and limit the ability of the paper to determine if there are any differences between populations\nA proprietary risk-adjustment model is used. While their published C-statistics are impressive, this model has only been validated by the\u00a0authors. Using an internationally validated model such as APACHE or\u00a0SOFA, or conversely making their model open-access, would be helpful in\u00a0providing external validity\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn a large population of UK patients, attending A&E at the weekend is not associated\u00a0with a significant difference in the risk adjusted 30 day in-hospital mortality compared\u00a0with attending during the week.\nBeing admitted to hospital at the weekend is associated with an increased risk adjusted\u00a0in-hospital mortality compared with being admitted on a weekday. This association was more pronounced in patients who were admitted directly to the hospital rather than via A&E\nThere are differences in the age, diagnoses and co-morbidities of patients who are directly admitted at the weekend compared with those who are admitted during the week. These differences are likely to result in differences in outcomes for patients admitted at the weekend vs. a weekday. It is unclear how much of the difference in outcomes reported is due to the difference in populations that present at a weekend compared with a weekday and how much is due to other factors\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Higher Mortality Rates amongst emergency patients admitted to hospital at weekends reflect a lower probability of admission\n[further reading] Increased Mortality associated with weekend hospital admission: A case for expanded seven day services?\n[further reading] Weekend specialist intensity and admission mortality in acute hospital trusts in England: A cross sectional study\n[Further Reading] The Weekend Effect: Now you see it, now you don\u2019t\n[Further Reading] Weekend vs Weekday transplant surgery and outcomes after kidney transplantation in the USA: A retrospective National Database analysis\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Segun Olusanya\nSummary date: 12th May 2016\nPeer-review editor: Dave Slessor and Steve Mathieu\n\n\n"
