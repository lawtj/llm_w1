DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2313680\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients undergoing tracheal intubation does pre-oxygenation with non-invasive ventilation compared with pre-oxygenation with an oxygen mask reduce the incidence of hypoxemia during intubation?\n\nBackground\n\nEmergency intubation in the emergency department or ICU is common with >2 million events in the USA/year\nEmergency intubation is associated with high adverse event rate, thought to be up to 40% in this cohort compared with ~2% of operating theatre intubations\nHypoxemia is a common event and is associated with cardiac arrest in emergency intubation\nPre-oxygenation denitrogenates the functional residual capacity of the lung, effectively giving a buffer during the apnoeic period following induction of anaesthesia\nThere has been some concern that using BiPAP or other forms of positive non-invasive ventilatory support in the pre-oxygenation and apnoeic phase, can insufflate the stomach and increase the risk of aspiration\nThere is limited evidence to date as to which pre-oxygenation technique is best\n\nDesign\n\nThe\u00a0PRagmatic trial Examining\u00a0Oxygenation prior to\u00a0Intubation (PREOXI trial)\u00a0hypothesised that use of BiPAP for pre-oxygenation would reduce the chance of hypoxia during urgent intubation\nMulti-centre, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial\n1:1 randomisation, with allocation concealment (sequentially numbered opaque envelopes)\nRandomisation was stratified to site with permuted blocks of variable sizes\nNo blinding\nDelayed consent\n\nSetting\n\n24 sites: 7 emergency departments and 17 ICUs in the USA, in 15 different hospitals\nOperators had performed a median of 50 previous tracheal intubations\nThe trial ran between March 2022 and October 2023\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nThose requiring urgent intubation\n> 18 years\nThe intubation involved the use of sedation and laryngoscopy\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nKnown to be pregnant\nKnown to be a prisoner\nWere already receiving positive-pressure ventilation\nHad apnoea or hypopnoea\nHad an immediate need for tracheal intubation that precluded randomization\nPatients were also excluded if the clinician performing the procedure (referred to as the \u201coperator\u201d) determined that preoxygenation with noninvasive ventilation was contraindicated\n\n\nA sample size of 1264 was deemed necessary to detect a difference of 6% in the primary outcome (85% statistical power, and a two-sided alpha level of 0.05). This was increased to 1300 to ensure adequate power if data was missing\nA total of 4567 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 1301 were randomised. The main reasons for exclusion were urgent intubation with no time for randomisation (924), already on NIV (840) or vomiting, hematemesis, hemoptysis, or epistaxis (389) excluding the use of NIV\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nThe groups were well matched at baseline\nThe median age was 61 years, 39.6% were female, BMI was 27.6 vs 26.6, intubation was in the ICU in 73.8% vs 72.6% of cases (the rest in the emergency room), median APACHE II was 17\nIn the hour before intubation, 27.6% vs 27.1% were on vasopressors, 23.3% vs 25.2% were on HFNO, 58.9% vs 58.7% had an FiO2:SaO2 <315.\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n645 patients were randomised to the NIV group\n\nBiPAP was applied during pre-oxygenation for a minimum of 3 minutes. FiO2 100%, EPAP > 5cm H20, IPAP >10cm H2O, respiratory rate >10/minute\n616 received preoxygenation with NIV, 22 received preoxygenation with oxygen mask, 7 received another device\nDuring interval between induction & initiation of laryngoscopy 88.1% received positive pressure ventilation\n\n\n\nControl\n\n656 were randomised to the oxygen mask group\n\nOperators were instructed to use a non-rebreather mask or bag mask O2 device without manual ventilation\nVarious combination of techniques were applied (in some cases patients got more than one different technique), most commonly a non-rebreather mask (87.7%), HFNO (12.2%), Bag mask O2 without ventilation (13.7%), Bag mask O2 with ventilation (1.2%). 4 patients received NIV\nDuring interval between induction & initiation of laryngoscopy 31.1% received positive pressure ventilation (includes noninvasive ventilation and bag-mask ventilation \u2013 patients could receive both, either or none)\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nThe agents used for induction were at the discretion of the operator\nPatient positioning was at the discretion of operator\nVentilation with a bag-mask or NIV after induction of anaesthesia and/or apnoeic oxygenation allowed at discretion of operator\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: The primary outcome was hypoxemia during intubation, defined by an oxygen saturation of less than 85% during the interval between induction of anaesthesia and 2 minutes after tracheal intubation\n\nIn the NIV group, 57 of 624 patients (9.1%) and in the oxygen-mask group 118 of 637 patients (18.5%) developed hypoxemia (difference, \u22129.4% 95% CI, \u221213.2 to \u22125.6; P<0.001)\nNNT =11\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nIn the NIV group, 39 of 624 patients (6.2%) and in the oxygen-mask group 84 of 637 patients (13.2%) developed hypoxemia with SaO2 <80% (difference, \u22126.8% 95% CI, \u221210.2 to \u22123.7)\nIn the NIV group, 39 of 624 patients (2.4%) and in the oxygen-mask group 84 of 637 patients (5.7%) developed hypoxemia with SaO2 <70% (difference, \u22123.2% 95% CI, \u22125.4 to \u22121.1)\nCardiac arrest between induction of anaesthesia and 2 minutes after tracheal intubation occurred in 1/645 patients (0.2%) in the NIV group and in 7/656 patients (1.1%) in the oxygen-mask group (difference, \u22120.9%; 95% CI, \u22121.8 to \u22120.1)\nNew or increased use of vasopressors 17.2% (NIV group), 17.8% (mask group)\nSBP <65mmHg 2.9% (NIV group) vs 4.4% (mask group)\n\n\nSubgroup Analysis:\n\nAll pre-specified subgroups favoured NIV (high BMI, intubation in the ICU, those with hypoxemic respiratory failure as cause of intubation, FiO2 in hour before intubation, high APACHE II scores)\n\n\nSafety:\n\nAspiration as assessed by clinical, physiological and radiological variables: 6 of 645 patients (0.9%) in the NIV group and in 9 of 656 patients (1.4%) in the oxygen-mask group\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\u201cIn this trial involving critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation in an emergency department or an ICU, the incidence of hypoxemia was lower with preoxygenation with noninvasive ventilation than with an oxygen mask\u201d\n\nStrengths\n\nPragmatic design, allocation concealment, intention to treat analysis,\nData available for primary outcome in 624/645 in NIV group and 637/656 in mask group\nMultiple sites improves generalisability\nLarge Sample Size improves power\nHeterogeneity Analysis\nData collection by independent assessor\n\nWeaknesses\n\n20% of patients were excluded due to already being on NIV. However, it is completely reasonable to exclude this group\nHypoxemia is a surrogate outcome, but IS reliable and correlates with clinically important outcomes, eg cardiac arrest\nThe control arm would not be usual practice in many centres. The use of a NRBM seems to be particular to the USA. My understanding is that in Australia and the UK, the most common pre-oxygenation technique would be BVM device often with a PEEP valve, or a Mapleson C circuit and manual ventilation during apnoea. HFNO is another commonly used technique for pre-oxygenation. The external validity is thus questionable\nDuring the apnoeic period, ventilation was not mandated. Again this differs from my usual practice making these results difficult to apply to my practice.\nConsideration of plastic waste and cost should be considered if a BiPAP circuit is used for just a few minutes prior to intubation\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis is a very thought provoking study and challenges my usual practice\nI will be more likely to use BiPAP when intubating critically ill patients\nHowever, the control group (mostly pre-oxygenation with a NRBM) in this trial does not reflect usual practice in my institution, so it is difficult to apply these results to my practice\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle PREOXI trial\nfurther reading Pre-oxygenation with high-flow nasal oxygen, compared with standard face-mask oxygen\nfurther reading PreVent trial: bag mask ventilation (BMV) between induction and laryngoscopy and the risk of hypoxaemia\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford @celiabradford\nSummary date: July 3 2024\nPeer-review editor: david slessor\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
