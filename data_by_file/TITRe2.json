NEJM 2015;372(11):997-1008. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1403612\nClinical Question\n\nIn adults undergoing cardiac surgery, does a restrictive transfusion strategy (Hb > 75 g/l) compared to a liberal transfusion strategy (Hb > 90 g/l) lead to fewer infections and ischaemic events within 3 months?\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, randomised, controlled trial\nSecure online allocation process with complete concealment\nAllocation minimisation to balance assignment by centre and surgery\nClinicians not blinded, but patients and investigators were\n\nPatients were asked if they thought they knew their allocation at:\n\ndischarge: \u00a015.1% believed they did and 75.6% were correct\n3 months: 27.5% believed they did and 56.6% were correct\n\n\n\n\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nPower analysis concluded 1468 patients needed to have 90% power with two-sided 5% level of significance\n\nIncreased to 2000 to allow for non-adherence\nBased upon estimate of primary outcome of:\n\nrestrictive group 11%\nliberal group 17%\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n17 cardiac surgery centres across the UK\nJuly 2009 to February 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: over 16 years undergoing non-emergency cardiac surgery\n\nPatients recruited and consented prior to surgery but only randomised and included if their Hb was recorded at below 90 g/l at any post-operative time\n\n\nExclusion: patients unwilling to receive blood products (e.g. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses), congenital or acquired platelet, red cell or clotting disorders, sepsis, critical limb ischaemia, emergency surgery (occurring on same day as admission)\n3565 consented, 2007 became anaemic and were randomised, 2003 analysed\n\nIntervention\n\nRestrictive transfusion-threshold\n\nThreshold of 75 g/l\n1 unit packed red cells transfused if threshold breached\nRepeated as needed if remained or dropped below 75 g/l again\n\n\n\nControl\n\nLiberal transfusion-threshold\n\nThreshold of 90 g/dl\n1 unit packed red cells transfused immediately after randomisation\nRepeated as needed if remained or dropped below 90 g/l again\n\n\n\nTreatment common to both groups\n\n\nTreating physicians could contravene the assigned threshold and administer / withhold a transfusion, but only with clear documentation of the reason\nTreating physicians could permanently discontinue adherence to the assigned threshold\n\nData were still collected as per intention-to-treat\n\n\nAll other aspects of management were as per the treating centre\u2019s usual care\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: there was no statistically significant difference in the composite outcome of serious infections or ischaemic events within 3 months\n\nThis outcome required the event to occur within the index hospital admission, or to have resulted in re-admission, or through detection by postal or phone survey of patients at home\nRestrictive transfusion group 35.1% vs Liberal transfusion group 33.0%\n\nOdds ratio 1.11 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.34); p-value 0.30\nAbsolute risk increase 2.11% (95% CI -2.14% to 6.36%)\nNumber needed to harm (by a restrictive transfusion practice) is 48\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome: the only secondary outcome\u00a0(other than the dependent variable of red cell transfusions)\u00a0to demonstrate a statistically significant difference was death at 90 days (according to a Cox proportional regression analysis) which favoured a liberal transfusion strategy\n\nRed cells transfused: liberal 95% vs restrictive 64%\n\nNumber needed to prevent transfusion (by a restrictive transfusion practice) is 4\n\n\nOccurrence of infection: liberal 25% vs restrictive 25%\nOccurrence of an ischaemic event: liberal 14% vs restrictive 16%\nMedian duration of ICU stay, HDU stay and hospital stay (see table)\nAll cause mortality at 90 days: liberal 1.9% vs restrictive 2.6%\n\np-value 0.045\nNumber need to harm (by a restrictive transfusion practice) is 63\n\n\nSignificant pulmonary complications: liberal 12% vs 13%\nEQ-5D health status: no statistical difference between groups or before and after surgery!\n\n\nTertiary data:\n\nSevere non-adherence to protocol: liberal 6.2% vs restrictive 9.7%\nProportion of patients that suspected they knew their allocation at 3 months: liberal 26% vs restrictive 29%\n\nThe proportion of these that were correct: liberal 45% vs restrictive 68%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe authors concluded that a restrictive transfusion strategy did not demonstrate clinical (or financial \u2013 data not presented here) superiority over a liberal transfusion strategy.\n\nStrengths\n\nImportant clinical question in a population not previous investigated through studies like TRICC, TRISS or Villanueva\n\nPatients in this trial had cardiovascular disease (although they were \u2018treated\u2019 for this during the index admission)\nTherefore, it might be reasonable to extrapolate these findings to unwell patients with cardiovascular disease (such as acute coronary syndrome)\n\n\nVery well planned and executed clinical research\nAttempts to blind pragmatically, and effort to investigate how successful this was\nIntention-to-treat, allowing clinicians to contravene allocation on clinical grounds\n\nSensitivity analysis (data not presented here) investigated impact of this and found no significant effect on conclusion\n\n\nConsiderable effort made to follow-up and detect outcome events in patients at home (leading to a rate double that of the anticipated rate)\nTransparent data available in detailed supplementary data\n\nWeaknesses\n\nComposite outcome \u2013 can lead to clinically less significant but common outcomes being very influential on the conclusion, whilst clinically more significant but rarer outcomes are over-looked\n\nThe secondary breakdown of events suggests this isn\u2019t the case in this trial, since all sub-groups demonstrate little difference between the groups\n\n\nUn-blinding of patients \u2013 the difference in practice (give blood early vs give blood later) appears to have led to un-blinding of patients\n\nMore patients in the restrictive group correctly identifying their allocation\nThe authors attempted to collect objective outcomes using blinded assessors, limiting the bias that could occur if patients believed they knew (and correctly knew) their allocation\nThe published supplementary data suggests that patients believed a liberal threshold was beneficial, thus the un-blinded restrictive-threshold patients may have biased their reporting of symptoms\nIt is unclear exactly what impact, if any, this had on the conclusion\nIt is likely that other trials have had this problem, but it has not been investigated or reported as succinctly as this trial has done so\n\n\nNumber needed to prevent transfusion of 4 \u2013 although no clinical or financial differences were found in this trial, there are unmeasured consequences of transfusion\n\nIf all measured factors are equal, a number needed to prevent transfusion of 4 may be very relevant to individuals who wish to avoid transfusion\n\n\nThe only statistically significant difference was death at 90 days \u2013 if all other measured outcomes are almost equal, what is causing the difference in death at 90 days?\n\nMore commonly, trials find a difference in morbidity but not in mortality, so this is an oddity\nStatistically, there is ~5% chance it is a false positive\nThe authors suggest that the small numbers that died in this trial prevent a cause-and-effect conclusion being drawn, but that the trend is supportive of a theory that warrants further investigation\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\nIn a group of patients with cardiovascular disease that have recently undergone cardiac surgery, a transfusion threshold of 75 g/l demonstrated no benefit over a transfusion threshold of 90 g/l\nThere is possibly a trend towards increased morbidity, and an (unexplained) statistically significant increase in mortality from a 75 g/l transfusion threshold\nGlobal interpretation of this study is \u201cin this group of patients, a transfusion threshold of 90 g/l is most appropriate\u201d, but this RCT does not conclusively show this in my opinion\nIt does suggest that clinicians are justified in tailoring transfusion thresholds of between 75 and 90 g/l to individual patients, as there is no definite harm and no cost difference (in the UK) from these two limits\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0TITRe2: Liberal or restrictive transfusion after cardiac surgery by Murphy et al\n[further reading]\u00a0Post Cardiac Surgery
