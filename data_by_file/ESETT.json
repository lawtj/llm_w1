NEJM 2019; 381:2103-13\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with status epilepticus who have been treated with benzodiazepines, is Levetriracetam, Valproate or Fosphenyoin more likely to lead to an absence of seizures and improved responsiveness at 60 minutes?\n\nBackground\n\nBenzodiazepines are the established first line treatment for the management of seizures. There is limited evidence to guide 2nd line treatments\nConSEPT and EcLIPSE compared levetiracetam (40mg/kg) vs. phenytoin (20mg/kg) for 2nd line treatment of paediatric status epilepticus. They reported that levetiracetam was not superior to phenytoin. The data for these trials were collected at a similar time to the current trial\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nInvestigator initiated\nBlinded\nResponse-adaptive comparative-effectiveness design\nUse of age stratified \u201cuse next\u201d medication box to maintain allocation concealment\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\nPrimary outcome determined by treating Emergency department physician\nPatients followed up till hospital discharge or 30 days (whichever came first)\n720 patients provided 90% power to identify the most effective treatment when one treatment had a true response rate of 65% and the true response rate was 50% in the other 2 groups\nStopped early at pre-planned interim analysis as met predefined futility criteria\nModified intention to treat analysis for primary outcome (excluded patients who were enrolled twice)\n\nSetting\n\n57 Emergency Departments, USA,\n\nIncluded academic centres & community hospitals\n18 paediatric departments, 26 adult departments, and 13 sites enrolled both adult & paediatric patients\n\n\nData collected: 2015 \u2013 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAge \u2265 2 years\nTreated with minimally accepted cumulative dose of benzodiazepines\n\nDiazepam 10mg IV/PR, (0.3mg/kg if <32kg)\nLorazepam 4mg IV (0.1mg/kg if <32kg)\nMidazolam 10mg IV/IM (0.3mg/kg if <32kg)\n\n\nGeneralised convulsive seizure lasting >5 minutes\nContinued to have persistent or recurrent seizures at least 5 minutes after last dose of benzodiazepine, and no more then 30 minutes after last dose\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nPrecipitant to seizure: major trauma, hypoglygcaemia, hyperglycaemia, cardiac arrest, post-anoxia, pregnant,\nIntubated\nKnown contraindications to any of trial drugs including inborn metabolic diseases, liver disease, severe renal impairments\nPatients who were already taking anticonvulsants were NOT excluded, and randomly assigned to a treatment group without regard to their normal anticonvulsant regimen\n\n\nComparison of levetiracetam vs. fosphenytoin vs. valproate groups\n\nNumber of patients assigned: 145 vs. 118 vs. 121\n% of patients with eligibility deviations: 23% vs. 33% vs. 24%\n\nThese patients were included in the intention to treat analysis, but excluded from per-protocol analysis\nDeviations were due to\n\nBenzodiazepines having been administered too long before or too proximal to enrolment (n=50)\nInadequate dose of benzodiazepines before enrolment (n=26)\nEnrolment of patients without status epilepticus, including patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (n=33)\n\n\n\n\nAge\n\n0-5 years: 21% vs. 20% vs. 23%\n6-10 years: 12% vs. 13% vs. 6%\n11-20 years: 6% v. 9% vs. 15%\n>20 years: 61% vs 59% 56%\n\n\nMale: 53% vs. 60% vs. 54%\nRace \u2013 black: 43% vs. 42% vs. 45%\nHistory of epilepsy: 67% vs. 68% vs. 69%\nFinal diagnosis of non-epileptic spell: 9% vs. 9% vs. 11%\nMedian lorazepam dose equivalents\n\nPatients >=32kg: 4.7mg vs. 4.9mg vs. 5.0mg\nPatients <32kg: 0.2mg/kg vs. 0.2mg/kg vs. 0.2mg/kg\n\n\nMedian duration of seizure at enrolment: 62min vs. 59min vs. 62min\nBenzodiazepines given before arrival: 62% vs. 58% vs. 52%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nLevetiracetam\n\n60mg/kg (maximum 4500mg)\n50mg/ml\n\n\nValproate\n\n33.33mg/ml\n40mg/kg (maximum 3000mg)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nFosphenytoin\n\n16.6mg phenytoin equivalents per ml (mgPE)\n20mgPE per kg (maximum 1500mg)\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nDrugs given by infusion pump over 10 minutes\nRescue therapy given as clinically determined for persistent or recurrent seizures after 20 minutes from the the start of the trial drug infusion\nUnmasking of the trial drug for purposes of patient care, after determination of the primary outcome at 60 minutes, was allowed. This occurred in 154 (39%) of patients\nUnblinding prior to 60 minutes\u00a0 was considered a protocol deviation. This occurred in 46 (12%) of patients, but only after a criteria for failure with regard to the primary outcome had been met\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Absence of clinically apparent seizures & improving responsiveness at 60 minutes after the start of trial drug infusion, without additional anticonvulsant medication including medication used for endotracheal intubation\n\nComparing levetiracetam vs. fosphenytoin vs. valproate groups \u2013 no significant difference\n\n% with primary outcome: 47% vs. 45% vs. 46%\nPosterior probability that treatment is the most effective: 0.41 vs. 0.24 vs. 0.35\nResults similar in per-protocol and adjudicated outcome analyses\nNo interaction between treatment group and age group\n\n\nAmong the 207 patients in whom the primary outcome was not achieved 144 patients (70%) were treated with additional anticonvulsant medications, another 52 patients (25%) did not receive additional medication and had not had a clinically apparent seizure but did not have improving responsiveness\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nNo significant differences in\n\nAdmission to ICU\n\n60% vs. 59% vs. 59%\n\n\nSafety outcomes\n\nLife threatening hypotension within 60 minutes: 0.7% vs. 3.2% vs. 1.6%\nLife threatening cardiac arrhythmias within 60 minutes: 0.7% vs. 0% vs. 0%\nEndotracheal intubation within 60 minutes: 20% vs. 26.4% vs. 16.8%\nAcute respiratory depression: 8% vs. 12.8% vs. 8%\nDeath: 4.7% vs. 2.4% vs. 1.6%\nAcute seizure recurrence at 60 minutes to 12 hours: 10.7% vs. 11.2% vs. 11.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn benzodiazepine-refractory convulsive status epilepticus, the anticonvulsant drugs levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, and valproate each led to seizure cessation and improved alertness by 60 minutes in approximately half the patients, and the three drugs were associated with similar incidence of adverse events\n\nStrengths\n\nLarge sample of 400 enrolments, which provided adequate power to detect a difference between treatment groups\nWeight based dosing\nAdaptive statistical design used, increasing the chance of finding a difference if a true difference existed\nDouble blinded\n\nWeaknesses\n\nLarge number of patients included who did not meet enrolment criteria\nUnblinding of investigators and treating physicians occurred in 200 out of 400 enrolments\nStopped early\nStudy included young children as well as adults. The cause of the seizures may vary at different ages, and therefore respond better to different treatments\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with benzodiazepine refractory status epilepticus, the use of levetiracetam (60mg/kg), valproate (40mg/kg) or fosphenytoin (20mg/kg phenytoin equivalent), each led to the absence of seizures and improved responsiveness at 60 minutes in nearly half of the patients\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Randomized Trial of Three Anticonvulsant Medications for Status Epilepticus\n[further reading]\u00a0PulmCrit- All 2nd line conventional anti-epileptics are equally good\u2026 or equally bad?\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: David Slessor\nSummary date: 19th December 2019\nPeer-review editor: Steve Mathieu\n\n\n"
