However with this study excluded the results for the primary outcome were still statistically significant\nThe authors report that study methods were assessed for risk of bias, but this is not reported in the results. MAPPETT-3 and PEITHO provide 1/3 of patients for this meta-analysis, and both have weaknessness of concern.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThrombolysis for PE is associated with a lower all cause mortality when compared to anticoagulation. This improvement is maintained in the subgroup of \u2018intermediate risk\u2019 PE with a NNT of 65. This is despite a significant increase in major bleeding in the thrombolysis group, with a NNH of 18. Of note, patients who were\u00a0\u226465 years had no increase in major bleeding with thrombolysis.\nWith the MOPETT and TOPCOAT studies finding improved longterm outcomes with regards to pulmonary hypertension, and self assessment of overall health in the thrombolysis groups, this meta-analysis provides a convincing argument for the use of thrombolysis in submassive PE.\nIf I have a submassive PE, I want thrombolysis. (I am under 65 years). I would want half-standard dose as per the MOPETT trial. If my dad (he is over 65 years) had a sub-massive PE I would not recommend thrombolysis as the 12.9% chance of major bleeding means that the risks may outweigh the benefits.\n\nLinks\nabstract\u00a0/ doi: 10.1001/jama.2014.5990\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\npulmcrit\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@DavidSlessor\u00a0and\u00a0@DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 29 June 2014\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@stevemathieu75\n\n\n"
