This was based on\u00a0findings from a database of 209 critically ill patients who developed re-feeding associated hypophosphataemia\n\nSetting\n\n13 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand\nDecember 2010 \u2013 August 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: critically ill adults, serum phosphate concentration decreased to below 0.65mmol/L within 72 hours after starting nutritional support. This change needed to be > 0.16mmol/L decrease from any concentration previously recorded during the patient\u2019s ICU stay\nExclusion: other causes of hypophosphataemia e.g dialysis, recent parathyroidectomy or treatment for hyperphosphataemia\n339 patients randomised\nGroup baseline characteristics were well matched for: age; APACHE II score; diagnosis; admission source;\u00a0requirement for mechanical ventilation; body mass index; subjective nutritional assessment; chronic health states; and risk factors for refeeding\n\nIntervention\n\nRestricted caloric management group\n\n20 kcal/h for at least 2 days and then a gradual return to normal intake protocol over the following 2-3 days\n\n40 kcal/hr for 24 hours, then increased to 60 kcal/h for 24 hours, followed by 80% of calculated energy goals for 24 hours, with 100% of goals achieved by day 4\nIf serum phosphate\u00a0dropped below 0.71mmol/L at any time during the gradual return to normal intake protocol, energy intake was reduced to 20kcal/h and the patient was returned to day 2 of the study caloric management protocol\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard group: No calorific restriction\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: no statistical difference in the composite outcome of mean number of days alive after ICU discharge\n\n\u2018number of days alive\u2019 was a composite outcome consisting of\u00a0ICU length of stay, overall survival time and mortality at\u00a0day 60\n39\u00b79 (95% CI 36\u00b74-43\u00b77) in the standard group vs 44\u00b78 (95% CI 40\u00b79-49\u00b71) in the caloric restriction group\ndifference 4\u00b79 days, 95% CI -2\u00b73 to 13\u00b76, p=0\u00b719\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nprotocolised caloric restriction resulted in the following statistically significant improved outcomes:\n\nnumber of patients alive at day 60: (128 [79%] of 163 vs 149 [91%] of 164, p=0\u00b7002).

However it did increase two clinically important components of this composite measure, survival time and 60-day mortality. In addition there were fewer respiratory infections. I will continue to use a restrictive caloric feeding regimen whilst treating refeeding syndrome\n\nExternal Links\n\n[abstract]\u00a0Restricted versus continued standard caloric intake during the management of refeeding syndrome in critically ill adults: a randomised, parallel-group, multicentre, single-blind controlled trial\n[further reading] The statistical significance of randomized controlled trial results is frequently fragile: a case for a Fragility Index\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Steve Mathieu\nSummary date:\u00a020th\u00a0April 2016\nPeer-review editor: Dave Slessor\n\n\n"
