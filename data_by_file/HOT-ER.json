Respiratory Care\u00a02016; 61(3):291-299. doi:10.4187/respcare.04252\nClinical Question\n\nIn hypoxic adults presenting to the emergency department, does nasal high-flow oxygen compared to standard oxygen therapy reduce the need for advanced respiratory support?\n\nDesign\n\nSingle-centre, randomised, controlled trial\nRandomised by custom Microsoft Access application\nSequence concealed by sealed, opaque envelopes\nData collected from clinical notes by non-blinded study assessor\nIntention to treat analysis\n80% power at \u03b1=0.05 if 390 patients recruited\n\nBaseline conversion to advanced respiratory support of 24%\u00a0based upon pilot observational study\nExpected relative reduction of 33% with nasal high-flow oxygen\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nSingle tertiary academic city hospital in New Zealand\nJuly 2012 to May 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\u00a0Patient presenting to hospital via the emergency department with\n\nArrival or pre-hospital SpO2 < 92% (<90% if known chronic CO2 retention)\nAnd respiratory rate > 22 breaths/minute\n\n\nExclusion:\u00a0Intubated pre-hospital or received non-invasive ventilation (NIV)\u00a0immediately upon arrival; bullous lung disease; pneumothorax; facial abnormalities including trauma or trans-nasal neurosurgery; epistaxis within last 2 weeks\n1,287 patients screened, 322 were randomised, 303 were analysed (19 excluded from analysis)\n\nIntervention\n\nHigh-flow nasal oxygen\n\nAirvo1 or Airvo2 (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare)\nStarting 40 l/min at 37\u00b0C and FiO2 0.28\nTitrated according to clinical need\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard oxygen therapy\n\nHudson mask, Venturi device or nasal prongs\nAdministered at\u00a01-15 l/min\nTitrated according to clinical need\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nThe decision to convert to non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was according to the British Thoracic Society\u2019s guidelines\n\nPersistent or worsening hypoxaemia\nWorsening tachypnoea\nRising arterial PCO2\nPersistent respiratory acidosis with pH < 7.30 despite 30 minutes of optimised standard acute medical therapy\nWorsening fatigue or confusion\nDecision by the treating clinician that escalation of therapy was necessary\n\n\nChoice of NIV strategy (CPAP 5 cmH2O or BIPAP 5 and 10 cmH2O) was at clinician\u2019s discretion\nThe decision to convert to invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) was also according to the BTS guidelines\n\nNIV criteria met and clinician anticipated that invasive ventilation will be required\nFailure of NIV\nPatient unable to maintain a patent airway or manage secretions\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: no difference was seen in the rate of conversion to non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or invasive positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV)\n\nHFNC: 3.6%\nStandard O2: 7.3%\nP = 0.20 by Fisher\u2019s exact test\nAbsolute risk reduction: 3.6% (95% CI -1.57% to 8.79%)\nFragility Index: -3 patients\n\nThis means, if 3 patients who received NIV/IPPV in the HFNC group had the opposite outcome, this trial would then demonstrate a statistically significant difference\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nFailure to tolerate therapy: clinically significant rate in HFNC group\n\nHFNC: 8.5% (1 in 12 patients)\nStandard O2: 0%\n\n\nEmergency department length of stay: no difference\nHospital length of stay: no difference\n90 day mortality: no difference\n\nHFNC: 21.2%\nStandard O2: 17.4%\nP = 0.47 by Fisher\u2019s exact test\nAbsolute risk reduction: 3.82% (95% CI -5.06% to 12.7%)\n\n\nPatients satisfaction survey: Overall, patients rated Standard O2 better than HFNC\n\nHowever, 48% lost-to-follow-up\nMore patients described Standard O2 therapy as \u2018comfortable\u2019:\n\nHFNC: 73.4%\nStandard O2: 85.9%\nP = 0.076\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nOxygen therapy delivered by high-flow nasal cannulae did not reduce the need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation when compared against standard oxygen therapy\nHowever, the trial was unexpectedly underpowered and a true, clinically important\u00a0benefit may exist, therefore this trial should be considered a pilot for a larger (~900 patient) trial\nOne in 12 patients are intolerant of oxygen delivery via high-flow nasal cannulae\n\nStrengths\n\nImportant theory given increasing use of nasal high-flow oxygen therapy\nSensible inclusion and exclusion list with good generalisability to most Emergency Departments\nRandomised, controlled trial\nIntention-to-treat analysis\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNon-blinded with subjective primary outcome at clinician\u2019s discretion\nFailed to recruit target number, so under-powered to detect the expected or a smaller difference\nSignificant loss-to-follow-up for patient experience survey \u2013 strong likelihood of bias in reporting\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial did not\u00a0demonstrate a difference between nasal high-flow oxygen and standard oxygen therapy in hypoxic and dyspneic patients arriving in the Emergency Department\nSignificant weaknesses in the methodology mean that no firm conclusion can be drawn, as a false negative\u00a0result may have occurred\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Randomized Controlled Trial of Humidified High-Flow Nasal Oxygen for Acute Respiratory Distress in the Emergency Department: The HOT-ER Study\n[TBL\u00a0summary]\u00a0FLORALI trial\n[further reading]\u00a0High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy in adults\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Duncan Chambler\nSummary date: 5th July 2016\nPeer-review editor: Steve Mathieu\n\n\n"
