NEJM. 2023 DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2215145\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with severe community acquired pneumonia (CAP) does the use of hydrocortisone compared to a placebo reduce 28-day mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nSevere CAP has significant associated morbidity and mortality with up to 10% of those admitted to hospital requiring ICU admission\nThe use of steroids in CAP has been contentious with differing recommendations in various society guidelines\n\nThe ATS / ISDA recommend against their use in severe CAP, however the ESICM / SCCM guidelines favour their use\n\n\nThe recently published trial by Meduri et al showed no 60-day mortality benefit with the use of methylprednisolone in severe CAP. However, the conclusion in the associated editorial calls for further large scale RCTs before strong recommendations are made with respect to this intervention\n\nDesign\n\nDouble blind, placebo controlled, multi-centre RCT\nCentralised randomisation using a web-based system\n1:1 ratio in block sizes of 4\n\nStratified according to trial site and the use of mechanical ventilation\n\n\nPlacebo identically packaged\nPower calculation\n\n1146 patients needed to provide 80% power to detect a 25% relative risk reduction in mortality from a baseline of 27%\n\n\nCOVID-19 meant that recruitment was paused after 800 randomised as the trial group focused on a separate trial evaluating the use of hydrocortisone in COVID-19\nDSMB recommended discontinuation of enrolment at planned second interim analysis\n\nThis was based on: (1) felt to be unethical to continue to include placebo group, (2) the prolonged suspension and (3) another 400 patients unlikely to change outcome\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n31 French centres\nOctober 2015 to March 2020\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAge > 18\nAdmission to ICU\nCAP diagnosis suggested by \u2265 2 of cough, purulent sputum, chest pain and dyspnoea\nFocal shadowing on CXR / CT scan\nSevere disease defined by at least 1 of the following:\n\nPulmonary severity index (PSI) score > 130\nMechanical ventilation\nHFNC with FiO2 > 0.5 and P/F ratio < 300\nRebreathing mask with P/F ratio dependent on O2 flow (e.g. >10L the P/F < 300)\n\n\nAt least one dose of antibiotics administered\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nTreated by vasopressors for septic shock at time of inclusion\nClinical history suggesting aspiration\nTreated by invasive mechanical ventilation within last 14 days\n> 7 days of antibiotics prior\nPCR +ve for influenza\nUse of > 15mg prednisolone (or equivalent) / day for > 30 days\nPregnancy\nCF, active TB or fungal infection and active viral hepatitis or active infection with herpes virus\n\n\n5948 screened with 800 randomised\n\n401 to receive hydrocortisone\n399 to receive placebo\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nBalanced between groups\nAge: 67 vs 67\nMale: 70 vs 69%\nCOPD: 22 vs 27%\nDiabetes: 24 vs 22%\nMechanical Ventilation (IMV or NIV): 45 vs 44%\nHFNC: 42 vs 41%\nNonrebreather mask: 13 vs 15%\nPSI Score IV: 38 vs 34%\nPSI Score V: 46 vs 49%\nMedian CRP: 26 vs 24 mg/dL\nMedian Cortisol: 302 vs 307 nmol/L\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nHydrocortisone\n\n200mg/day for 4 days\nTreating team using predefined criteria decided whether to administer for a total of 8 or 14 days with a prespecified tapering plan\n\n8 days total if all of the following met on day 4: P/F > 200, breathing spontaneously and day 4 SOFA \u2264 the SOFA score on day 1\n\n\nMedian duration 5 days\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\nSame protocol used\nMedian duration 6 days\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nTreatment discontinued on ICU discharge\nOther management (including choice of respiratory support) at discretion of treating teams but should follow standard therapy\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nDeath by day 28: Hydrocortisone 6.2% vs Placebo 11.9%\n\nDifference -5.6% (-9.6 to -1.7%), p = 0.006\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nComparing hydrocortisone vs. placebo group\n\nNo significant difference in\n\nCumulative incidence of hospital acquired infection by day 28: 9.8 vs 11.1%\nCumulative incidence of GI bleeding by day 28: 2.2 vs 3.3%\n\n\nSignificantly greater in intervention group\n\nMedian daily dose of insulin by day 7: 35.5 vs 20.0 IU/day\n\n\nSignificantly less in intervention group\n\nDeath by day 90: 9.3% vs 14.7%\nCumulative incidence of endotracheal intubation by day 28: 18.0 vs 29.5%\nCumulative incidence of endotracheal intubation by day 28 in those not receiving at baseline: 19.5% vs 27.7%\nCumulative incidence of vasopressor initiation by day 28 in those not receiving at baseline: 15.3 vs 25.0%\n\n\n\n\nSelected Subgroups:\nComparing hydrocortisone vs placebo, the following subgroups trended to favouring hydrocortisone use:\n\nNot mechanically ventilated: 6/222 vs 22/220\n\nRisk difference -7.3 (95% CI -12.6 to -2.0)\n\n\nNo germ isolated: 11/189 vs 25/168\n\nRisk difference \u2013 9.1 (95% CI -15.0 to -3.1)\n\n\nAge > 65: 19/222 vs 38/228\n\nRisk difference -8.1 (95% CI -13.3 to -2.9)\n\n\nWomen: 4/119 vs 16/124\n\nRisk difference -9.5 (95% CI -16.7 to -2.3)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nEarly treatment with hydrocortisone reduced 28-day mortality in those admitted to the ICU with severe CAP\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre, double blind, placebo-controlled trial\nBalanced baseline characteristics \u2013 especially with respect to other classically steroid responsive conditions such as COPD and asthma\nEarly initiation of hydrocortisone \u2013 initiated within ~20 hours from hospital admission\nMinimal apparent selection bias \u2013 of the 5148 excluded, very few were for reasons other than the pre-defined exclusion criteria (n = 276 \u201cmedical team declined\u201d and n = 79 \u201cno reason provided\u201d)\nMinimal loss to follow up (2 patients)\nThe exclusion of septic shock sensible given potential benefits shown with the use of steroids in this patient cohort\nIncluded patients who clearly had severe CAP with respect to ventilatory support required at randomisation and PSI score\nHigh level of adherence to protocol with very few protocol violations\n\nOnly 6% received open label steroids\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle country\nAlthough 800 patients randomised there were lower mortality numbers than predicted\n\nOnly 72 deaths across both arms with a fragility index 6 patients\n\n\nOptimal steroid and steroid regimen (e.g. tapered or not) yet to be determined especially with differing pharmacological properties\n\nThe benefit of dexamethasone shown in COVID-19 in the RECOVERY trial and ARDS patients in DEXA-ARDS trial\n\n\nMicrobiological investigation not standardized\n\n~45% no pathogen identified\nThe subgroup in which no pathogens were isolated trended to favouring steroid use compared to those in whom a pathogen was isolated (Figure S3)\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFollowing this trial, I will now strongly consider the use of steroids in patients admitted with severe CAP\nI await the publication of REMAP-CAP non pandemic corticosteroid domain, as a larger platform trial will hopefully further inform practice\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Hydrocortisone in Severe Community Acquired Pneumonia\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:
