A sensible inclusion criteria of antimicrobials being started before enrolment addressed the potential confounding effect of late administration\nSubgroup analyses for variation in mortality between countries\nStatistical analysis plan published before recruitment was completed eliminates the risk of analytical bias\n\nWeaknesses\n\nLower APACHE scores than ProCESS and Rivers study but this has been addressed with a subgroup analysis of those with APACHE II scores of < 25 and > 25. There was still no difference in mortality between EGDT and usual-care in the sicker group although the total numbers were small in > 25 group (n=69)\nLow recruitment rate per month across all centres. The largest recruiting centre (Austin Health) recruited at a mean rate of just over 2 patients per month. However, adherence with EGDT protocol was high and management of sepsis well established in usual care practice. This low rate reflects the complexities of conducting research studies. Multi-centre involvement is essential both for ensuring generalisability and appropriately powered trials\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAnother nail in the coffin for EGDT and specifically continuous central venous co-oximetry, liberal blood transfusion policy and probably dobutamine. Despite the stark difference between ProCESS & ARISE compared with the Rivers paper, it is essential that we continue to recognise the importance of high standard of care in sepsis. Early recognition, source control, antimicrobial therapy, fluid resuscitation and escalation remain the fundamental treatment goals. \u00a0I eagerly await the results of ProMISe to complete the triumvirate of modern EGDT in sepsis trials.\n\nExternal Links\n\n\n\n[Original article]\u00a0Goal-Directed Resuscitation for Patients with Early Septic Shock\n[Further reading] ARISE: Supplementary Appendix\u00a0\n[Further reading]\u00a0Harmonizing international trials of early goal-directed resuscitation for severe sepsis and septic shock: methodology of ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe.\n[Further reading] The Bottom Line review of ProCESS\n[Further reading] Rivers.
