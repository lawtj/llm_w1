    "full_content": "\nTweet\nOSCAR Study Group: High-Frequency Oscillation for Acute RespiratoryDistress Syndrome\nYoung et al for the OSCAR Study Group.\u00a0N Engl J Med 2013; 368:806-813.\nClinical Question\n\nDoes High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation (HFOV), compared with conventional ventilation, improve 30 day mortality in patients with ARDS?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nPermuted block randomisation\nStratified by baseline characteristics\n\nSetting\n\n27 general ICUs in UK with varying experience of HFOV\nDec 2007 \u2013 July 2012\n\nPopulation\n\nMechanical ventilation for <7 days; and ARDS defined by all of the following:\n\nPaO2/FiO2 <200mmHg (26.7 kPa)\nPEEP >5\nBilateral pulmonary infiltrates, without evidence of left atrial hypertension\n\n\n\nThe Definition of ARDS has since been revised and this entry criteria match the draft Berlin definition of \u2018moderate\u2019 and \u2018severe\u2019 ARDS. The lastest Berlin Definition uses PEEP > 10cm water as part of its criteria for severe ARDS\u00a0\n\n795 patients randomised (28.7% of the 2769 patients screened)\nExclusions: Ventilated for > 7 days; < 16 years of age; weighed < 35 kg; particpating in other research trials; lung disease characterised by airway narrowing or gas trapping\u2019 recent lung surgery\n\nIntervention\n\nHFOV using Novalung R100 ventilator (Metran) until the start of weaning.\nInitial settings were:\n\nventilation frequency of 10 Hz\nmean airway pressure of 5 cm water above the plateau airway pressure at enrollment\nbias flow rate of 20 litres per minute\ncycle volume of 100 ml (the volume of gas used to move the oscillating diaphragm; the tidal volume delivered to the alveoli is a fraction of this volume)\nFiO2 1.0\nFixed I:E ratio 1:1\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm for weaning. If patients reached a mean airway pressure of 24 cm water, at an FiO2 0.4 or less with a paO2 level of 60mmHg (8 kPa) or more for at least 12 hours, they were switched to pressure-controlled ventilation for weaning from mechanical ventilation\nPatients could be restarted on HFOV up to 2 days after the start of weaning\n\nControl\n\nVentilated according to local practice. \u00a0\nEncouraged to use ARDSnet style ventilation (different in OSCILLATE where this was mandated) i.e pressure-controlled ventilation at 6-8 ml/kg of ideal body weight with combinations of PEEP and FiO2 values used in the ARDSnet study\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary Outcome: Mortality at 30 days\n\n41.7% in HFOV vs. 41.1% in control. Absolute difference 0.6% (95% C.I. -6.1 to 7.5)\n\n\nOxygenation improved with HFOV when compared with conventional ventilation\n\nPaO2:FiO2 ratio (mmHg) on Day 2: 212 vs. 163\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nNo benefit or harm was found from the use of HFOV in adult patients with ARDS. HFOV should not be used for routine care\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre\nIntention-to-treat\nIndependent telephone randomisation system\nAppropriate power calculation\nAPACHE II mean score of 21.8 i.e sick patients\n\nWeaknesses\n\n2/3rds of patients screened were not recruited. It is unclear why in a 1/3 of the cases (\u2018had other reasons\u2019)\nSlow recruitment. Average 0.82 patients per ICU month\n20 of the 29 units had not previously had any experience with using HFOV. However > 2000 people were trained before recruitment started and reflective of UK practice at the time\nARDSnet ventilation was encouraged rather than mandated\nThe Novalung R100 ventilator was used in the HFOV group. This has not been used before in clinical trials. Other studies (including OSCILLATE) have used the SensorMedics 3100B ventilator, a device that has an electromechanically given diaphragm, which normally oscillates with an I:E fixed 1:1 ratio\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHFOV improved oxygenation but did not improve 30 day mortality when compared with conventional ventilation in patients with ARDS (approximates to \u2018moderate to severe\u2019 using new definition)\nHFOV should not be used for routine care in ARDS.\nThe OSCILLATE trial which was published concurrently reported a lower mortality in\u00a0 conventional ventilation group (35% vs. 41%). One of the reasons may be that ARDSnet ventilation was mandated in OSCILLATE rather than suggested in OSCAR\nBefore selling your oscillator on e-bay, some may still consider it an option for rescue therapy in ARDS whilst making an ECMO referral\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf / abstract / Doi:\u00a010.1056/NEJMoa1215716\n[further reading]\u00a0Severity of Hypoxemia and Effect of High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\nEditorial, Commentaries and Blogs\n\nJICS cast \u2013 Duncan Young on the Oscar Trial (interviewers J Day & S Olusanya)\nHFOV \u2013 Life in the Fast Lane.
