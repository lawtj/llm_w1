Lancet 2000; 356:2139-2143. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(00)03495-4\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients renal dysfunction, does dopamine reduce the severity of acute kidney injury?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, placebo-controlled trial\nBlock randomised with stratification by centre, with adequate concealment\nAllocation blinded to patient, nurses, physicians and investigators\nAimed to recruit\u00a0230 patients to provide 80% power to detect a 20% decrease in peak serum creatinine, with alpha = 0.05. This assumed a normal distribution of peak serum creatinine, with a mean of 250 \u00b5mol/l and standard deviation of 150 \u00b5mol/l in the control arm.\n\n20% chance of false negative\n5% chance of false positive\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n23 Intensive Care Units \u2013 22 in Australia and one in Hong Kong\nMarch 1996 to April 1999\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: 2 or more features of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS); and central venous catheter in situ; and at least one indicator of early renal dysfunction\n\n< 0.5 ml/kg/hr over 4 hours or longer\nCreatinine > 150 \u00b5mol/l if no premorbid kidney disease\nRise in serum creating of > 80 \u00b5mol/l in less than 24 hours in absence of CK > 5000 IU/ml or myoglobinurea\n\n\nExclusion: under 18 years of age; acute renal failure within last 3 months; renal transplant patients; use of dopamine during current hospital stay; baseline serum creatinine > 300 \u00b5mol/l\n467 patients screened of which 328 patients randomised\n\nMean APACHE II = 18 and SAPS II = 40.5\nShock present in 60%\nVentilated in 86%\nMean baseline creatinine 182 \u00b5mol/l and urea 14.4 mmol/l\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nDopamine infusion at 2 \u00b5g/kg/min\n\n163 assigned, and 161 analysed\nInfused for a mean of 113 hours\n\n\n\nControl\n\nSame infusion rate of identically prepared placebo fluid infusion (specific fluid composition not described)\n\n165 assigned, and 163 analysed\nInfused for a mean of 125 hours\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth the intervention and control were continued until any of the following: renal replacement therapy (RRT); death; related serious adverse event; SIRS and renal dysfunction resolved for at least 24 hours; discharge from ICU.\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: peak serum creatinine concentration (as a clinically appropriate surrogate for glomerular filtration rate) showed no statistically significant difference between the groups\n\ndopamine 245 \u00b5mol/l (SD=144) vs 249 \u00b5mol/l (147); difference 4\u00a0\u00b5mol/l (-28 to 36); p=0.8.\n\n\nSecondary outcome: there were no differences in any measures\n\nduration of mechanical ventilation: dopamine 10 vs placebo 11 days (p=0.63)\nduration of ICU stay: 13 vs 14 days (p=0.67)\nduration of hospital stay: 29 vs 33 days (p=0.29)\nincidence of arrhythmias: 33% vs 33%\nsurvival to ICU discharge: 67% vs 64%\nsurvival to hospital discharge: 57% vs 60%\nstopped due to related serious incident: 4% vs 4%\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\u201cThese findings support the view that low-dose dopamine does not confer a clinically significant degree of renal protection in critically ill patients, with SIRS, at risk of renal failure.\u201d\n\nStrengths\n\nGood methodology with adequate concealment and blinding\nSensible inclusion criteria; good generalisability\nMulti-centre recruitment\n\nWeaknesses\n\nIs peak serum creatinine an important outcome measure? Does it matter how high it goes, or does it matter how the renal dysfunction upsets patients pathophysiologically?\nConcurrent administration of other renal-active drugs, such as furosemide (n=90 in each group)\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThere is no place for dopamine to prevent renal dysfunction from getting worse in patients with SIRS.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Low-dose dopamine in patients with early renal dysfunction: a placebo-controlled randomised trial.\n[Editorial]\u00a0Renal-dose dopamine: will the message now get through? by Galley\n[Further reading]\u00a0Dopamine by Life in the Fast Lane\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 12 Sept 2014\nPeer-review editor: @DavidSlessor\n\n\n"
