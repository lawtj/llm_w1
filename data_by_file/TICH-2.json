The Lancet 2018; doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31033-X\nClinical Question\n\nIn adults with acute, spontaneous intra-cerebral haemorrhage (ICH) does the administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) compared to a placebo improve functional status at 90 days?\n\nBackground\n\nSpontaneous ICH has a high mortality and morbidity. Haematoma expansion has been independently associated with death and poor outcome. Expansion occurs more frequently in the first three hours, however it has been shown to occur later than this.\nMultiple modalities to try to improve outcome have been studied. Early surgery (STICH-II) and intensive blood pressure lowering (INTERACT) were not shown to reduce risk of death or severe disability.\u00a0Recombinant Factor VII is the most widely studied haemostatic therapy, however a Cochrane Review showed no significant reduction in death or disability.\nThe use of TXA had not previously been widely studied. One small Malaysian study of 30 patients looking at TXA use in spontaneous ICH found significant haematoma expansion in the control group, and a meta-analysis of 2 RCTs showed a significant reduction in ICH progression in traumatic brain injuries.\n\nDesign\n\nDouble blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase III trial\nRegistered in the UK by the NIHR and written consent obtained where available. If not, proxy consent granted and then consent sought as soon as possible\nRandomised 1:1 centrally in real-time\n\nStratified by country\nMinimisation for key prognostic factors (age, sex, time since onset, systolic blood pressure, NIHSS stroke severity, history of antiplatelet use and presence of intra-ventricular haemorrhage\n\n\nIdentical individual treatment packs were provided to all sites and all labelled with a unique pack number\nTotal sample size calculated at 2000 participants\n\nSignificance 0.05, power 90% \u00a0to detect an ordinal OR of 0.79 by shift analysis of modified Rankin Scale (mRS)\nOR of 0.79\u00a0based on distribution of mRS in ENOS trial and also lay in range seen in related trials (TXA in traumatic brain injury and Recombinant Factor VII for ICH)\n5% loss to follow-up and 20% reduction for baseline covariate adjustment also accounted for\n\n\nPre-specified secondary outcomes, sub groups and safety outcomes\n\nSub groups included onset to randomisation (< 3 and <4.5 hours), age (< 70),ethnicity, sex, systolic BP, NIHSS score (<15), history of anti-platelet use, presence of intra-ventricular haemorrhage, presence of spot sign, haematoma location, baseline haematoma volume (<30ml, 30-60ml, >60ml)\n\n\nParticipants reviewed at day 2, 7 and on day of discharge or death; followed up by phone (or postal questionnaire) at 90 days\nCT scan repeated after 24 hours of treatment (if multiple CT scans done, scan with closest timeframe to 24 hours used)\nCentral assessors who were trained in mRS and masked to treatment did final follow-up at 90 days; similarly CT scans (again masked to treatment) were reviewed by expert assessors, each using the same digital software\n\nSetting\n\n124 hospital sites in 12 countries\nMarch 203 \u2013 September 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdult patients with intra-cerebral haemorrhage were eligible if admitted to participating hospital within 8 hours of stroke onset (or time last seen well)\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nICH secondary to anticoagulation, trauma, thrombolysis, known underlying structural abnormality\nPre-morbid mRS > 4\nLife expectancy under 3 months\nGCS < 5\nContra-indication to TXA\nFemale of child-bearing potential, pregnant or breastfeeding\nGeographical factors preventing difficult follow-up at 90 days\n\n\n2325 randomised: 1161 assigned TXA and 1164 assigned placebo\n\n9 excluded from analysis in both arms\n\n\nBaseline characteristics similar in both arms\n\nThis included age, sex, ethnicity, time from onset to randomisation, history of anti-platelets, statin, stroke or TIA or ischaemic heart disease, pre-stroke mRS, GCS, NIHSS score, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, location and volume of haematoma, presence of intra-ventricular haemorrhage\n\n\nThe only slight difference was whether CT angiography was \u201cspot positive\u201d (20% in TXA group vs. 25% in placebo).\n\nThe CT Angiographic spot sign is an area of contrast enhancement that corresponds to a site of active haemorrhage and is an independent predictor of ICH growth and poor outcome\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nTranexamic Acid\n\n1g IV TXA in 100ml 0.9% NaCl infused over 10 minutes\nFollowed by another 1g in 250ml 0.9% NaCl infused over 8 hours\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\nNormal saline used in place of TXA above, otherwise identical intervention\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nParticipants received blood pressure lowering treatment, neurosurgery and\u00a0VTE prophylaxis as part of standard care.\n\nOutcome:\n\n\nPrimary Outcome: There was no difference in function status at day 90\n\nOrdinal OR: 0.88 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.03; p = 0.11)\n\n\nPre-specified sub-groups:\n\nIf systolic BP < 170 mmHg then TXA use beneficial\n\nOR 0.79 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.90; p = 0.0188)\n\n\nIf baseline haematoma volume 30 \u2013 60 mls TXA use beneficial\n\nOR 0.66 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.98; p value not reported)\n\n\nNo other pre-specified group had significant 95% CI\n\nThere were some non-significant trends to favour TXA use such as onset to randomisation time (less than 4.5 hours), age (under 70 years) and presence of intra-ventricular blood\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Outcomes:\n\nNo\u00a0other\u00a0pre-specified secondary outcomes were significant\n\nDeath at day 90\nMultiple functional assessment tools at day 90\nLength of hospital stay\nDestination of hospital discharge\n\n\n\n\nSafety Outcomes:\n\nFewer predefined serious events in TXA group at day 2 and day 90 with\n\nVTE events: TXA 3.4% vs Placebo 3.2% (P = 0.98)\nSeizures: TXA 6.6% vs Placebo 7.3% (P = 0.44)\nOther ischaemic events\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nTXA does not affect functional status at day 90, although some potential benefits were noted with regards to reduction in haematoma expansion, early death and numbers of serious adverse events\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre, randomised, control study\nPragmatically designed to answer an important question given mortality and morbidity of intracranial haemorrhage and benefit of TXA shown in other trials\nRigorous methodology results in good internal validity:\n\nExcellent protocols for blinding and allocation concealment reduces performance, detection, and recall bias\nWell balanced baselines minimise selection bias\nMinimal loss to follow-up reduces attrition bias\n\n\nGood adherence to protocol\nExcellent time from randomisation to treatment (median \u2013 21 minutes)\nPrimary outcome clinically relevant and important to patients\n\nWeaknesses\n\nMethodology\n\nThe primary outcome (modified Rankin Scale) is subjective and debatable when dichotomised into good vs bad\n\nDifferent assessors and patients may have applied the scoring system variably, although all assessors were trained and certified in using the outcome tools\n\n\nFollow up to 90 days could be considered short when considering rehabilitation after a major stroke\n\n\n\nThe trial team plan to publish 1 year follow-up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal validity (accuracy)\n\nThe broad inclusion criteria and heterogeneous study population may have biased toward the null hypothesis\n\nTesting the hypothesis in study populations with a short duration from onset to treatment or with a smaller initial haematoma volume may provide additional evidence in support of their theory specifically in these subgroups\n\n\nCompared to other TXA trials (WOMAN / CRASH-2), the number of patients recruited was small, which may have lead to this trial being underpowered to rule out a small but clinically meaningful effect\n\n\nExternal validity (generalisability)\n\nAlthough 124 centres were involved from 8 countries, 82% were from the UK; 5 countries recruiting only a total of 30 patients; and there was only one country outside Europe (Malaysia, which recruited 46 patients)\n\nThis reduces generalisability to lower-income healthcare systems and possibly non-European populations\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe signal of benefit from tranexamic acid administration seen in this trial has not been proven by conventional statistical significance thresholds\nGiven some non-significant trends in certain subgroups and low rates of serious events, further work looking at certain subgroups should be considered to identify patients that may benefit\nThe complementary CRASH-3 trial, investigating tranexamic acid administration in traumatic head injuries, will expand the evidence base in this area when published\nGiven the good safety profile and potential small benefit, it is reasonable to administer tranexamic acid early in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary IntraCerebral\nHaemorrhage (TICH-2): an international randomised,\nplacebo-controlled, phase 3 superiority trial\n\n[further reading] CT Angiographic Spot Sign by Radiopaedia\n[further reading] CRASH-3 Trial\n[further reading] Gayet-Ageron et al.
