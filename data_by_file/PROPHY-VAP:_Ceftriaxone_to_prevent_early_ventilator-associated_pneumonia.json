However, there is reluctance to embrace this treatment due to concerns that it could promote antibiotic-resistant pathogens\nIt is hypothesised that a single prophylactic dose of ceftriaxone in brain injured patients may reduce the incidence of VAP, and paradoxically reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance through reduced overall antibiotic prescription\u00a0\n\nDesign\n\nMulticentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial\nConducted in nine ICUs of eight French university hospitals\nEligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a web-based randomisation system, stratified by centre and severity of unconsciousness at the time of inclusion using a computer-generated sequence with variable block sizes\nPatients, health-care providers, assessors, and the study statistician were masked to the allocation group\nThe sample size was based on a mean incidence of early VAP of 30% in the control group, and the hypothesis that it could be reduced by half in the intervention group (15%)\nOn this basis, the investigators calculated that a sample size of 354 patients would provide 90% power at an \u03b1 of 0.05\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nThe trial protocol, including the statistical analysis plan, was published a priori\n\nSetting\n\n345 patients recruited between October 2015 and May 2020, of whom 171 were assigned to receive ceftriaxone and 174 to placebo\n15 patients did not receive the allocated intervention; 6 from the ceftriaxone group and 9 from the placebo group, and 11 patients withdrew consent; 3 from the ceftriaxone group and 8 from the placebo group\n319 patients were included in the analysis, of whom 162 were assigned to receive ceftriaxone and 157 to placebo\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Brain injured patients (head trauma, stroke, or subarachnoid haemorrhage), aged \u226518 years with a GCS \u226412 who had been intubated for less than 12\u2009hours, with an expected duration of MV more than 48 hours\nExclusions: The main exclusions were as follows:\n\nIntubation \u226548\u2009hours after admission\nETT with subglottic secretion drainage\nComa due to tumour, infectious disease or cardiac arrest\nHospitalisation within the last month\u00a0\nBeta-lactam allergy\nIn receipt of antibiotics at time of admission\u00a0\n\n\nBaseline demographics (ceftriaxone vs placebo):\n\nAge: 56 vs 57 years\nMale sex: 49% vs 55%\nBMI: 26 vs 26 kg/m2\u00a0\nMedical History:\n\nSmoking: 21% vs 22%\nAlcoholism: 17% vs 15%\nDiabetes: 4% vs 5%\nChronic lung disease: 3% vs 1%\n\n\nMain severe brain injury:\n\nIschaemic stroke: 10% vs 8%\nHaemorrhagic stroke: 22% vs 21%\nSubarachnoid haemorrhage: 38% vs 45%\nBrain trauma: 30% vs 26%\n\n\nGCS:\n\n3: 17% vs 13%\n4-8: 60% vs 65%\n9-12: 23% vs 22%\n\n\nSAPS score: 47 vs 48\nTime from tracheal intubation: 7 hours vs 7 hours\nMouth care with chlorhexidine: 4% vs 4%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nCeftriaxone\n\nSingle administration of 2g intravenous ceftriaxone\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\nSingle administration of intravenous saline\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nOpaque syringes and infusion lines as ceftriaxone in solution is slightly coloured\nVAP prevention measures were routinely implemented before trial commencement including hand washing, 30\u00b0 head-of-bed elevation, monitoring of ETT cuff pressure, mouth care and ulcer prevention\u00a0\nNone of the participating centres performed SDD\nVAP was declared according to American Thoracic Society criteria, which rely on clinical, radiological and microbiological criteria occurring at least 48 h after the start of mechanical ventilation\nA central adjudication committee composed of two senior intensivists masked to study group assignment, reviewed all declared cases\u00a0\nPatients who developed VAP (or other infection) received curative antibiotic therapy according to local protocols, based on national guidelines\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary efficacy endpoint: The incidence of early VAP (from 2nd \u2013 7th day) was significantly reduced in the ceftriaxone group\n\n14% vs 32% (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.95)\n\n\nSecondary efficacy endpoints:\u00a0\n\nThere was a significant increase in ventilator and antibiotic-free days, and a significant reduction in mortality and the incidence of all VAP in the ceftriaxone group at day 28\n\nAll VAP: 20% vs 36%\nVentilator-free days: 9 vs 5\u00a0\nAntibiotic-free days: 21 vs 15\nMortality: 15% vs 25%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafety outcomes:\n\nThere were 90 serious adverse events, which were all attributed to the initial disease and not to trial intervention\n3 patients developed Clostridium difficile infection; 1 in the ceftriaxone and 2 in the placebo group\nThere was 1 MRSA strain and 1 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae strain in the placebo group\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\u201cIn patients with brain injury who required ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, we found that early administration of a single ceftriaxone dose decreased the risk of VAP, exposure to ventilation, exposure to antibiotics, prolonged ICU and hospital stay, and mortality, with no safety concerns.\u201d\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre, randomised, controlled trial\nBlinded nature of the study and independent verification of VAP diagnosis reduced the potential for performance and reporting bias\nCentral randomisation with variable blocks ensured allocation concealment\nBaseline demographics were well matched between groups\u00a0\nMost patients received treatment according to their randomised group and there was minimal attrition\nThe choice of ceftriaxone as the prophylactic antibiotic was sensible given its microbiological cover and long half-life\nIntention to treat analysis preserved the randomisation schedule\nPragmatic inclusion and exclusion criteria captured the group of interest and enhanced external validity\u00a0\nThe authors hypothesis that overall antibiotic prescription would decrease in the intervention group was supported\nThis may be the most compelling form of VAP prevention \u2013 it has considerably better fidelity than SDD, which means that clinicians are more likely to use it, and unlike AMIKINHAL, had important patient-centered secondary outcome benefits, in particular mortality\n\nLimitations\n\nOther forms of VAP prevention were not monitored, so it is not possible to know to what extent this could have impacted results\nThe blinding procedure was not performed remotely, but by nurses from neighbouring units, which could have caused unmasking of the treatment. However, these nurses were not involved in direct patient care and opaque syringes and infusion lines were used\nThe adjudication committee that reviewed suspected cases of VAP was not independent\nThe choice of primary outcome could be considered controversial. VAP detection is notoriously inaccurate, and there are numerous possibilities for confounding, such as fever which is common in brain injured patients. The diagnosis of VAP also required required positive microbiology which may have been more difficult to detect following the administration of antibiotics\nThe 10% difference in mortality is unlikely to be caused by the intervention alone. Therefore there may be some confounding variables that have impacted the results reported\nWhilst the secondary outcome benefits are compelling, the study was not powered for these. Secondary outcomes are generally considered to be hypothesis generating. Those with enthusiastic priors may point to the overall weight of evidence in conjunction with other recent VAP prevention studies\nExternal validity was somewhat limited as the study was conducted only in France\nIt may be hard to conclude that there was no increased risk of antibiotic resistant pathogens, as the study was underpowered for this outcome and there were very few events. However, the reduction in overall antibiotic prescription may be considered a reasonable surrogate and SDD studies with more longitudinal follow up have generally not supported this concern\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhilst this is a historically divisive topic, it is becoming harder to argue against the consistent signal that a short course of prophylactic antibiotics among patients who are intubated due to acute brain injury is beneficial and safe\nThis well executed study provides evidence that an early, single dose of ceftriaxone prevents early VAP in patients with severe brain injury, as well as decreasing antibiotic and ventilation exposure, and mortality without safety concerns, and I will changing my practice accordingly\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle: Ceftriaxone to prevent early ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients with acute brain injury: a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, assessor-masked superiority trial\nfurther reading PulmCrit hot take: VAP prophylaxis (PROPHY-VAP trial)\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Andrew Achilleos\nSummary date: 27th January 2024\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\nImage by: CDC on Unsplash\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
