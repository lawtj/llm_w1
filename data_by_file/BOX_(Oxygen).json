DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2208686\nClinical Question\n\nIn comatose patients following cardiac arrest does a restrictive compared with a liberal oxygenation strategy, reduce death or survival at discharge with a poor neurological outcome?\n\nBackground\n\nHyperoxia can cause cellular damage via oxidative stress, absorption atelectasis, acute lung injury, central nervous system toxicity, reduced cardiac output and cerebral and coronary vasoconstriction, whereas hypoxia can cause ischaemic tissue injury\nTrials have compared restrictive vs liberal oxygen strategies in patients admitted to the ICU\nThe OXYGEN-ICU study reported a significantly lower mortality in patients treated with a restrictive strategy\nComparatively, in the larger ICU-ROX study there was no difference in mortality apart from in a post hoc analysis of a subgroup with ischaemic encephalopathy in whom a lower mortality was reported with conservative oxygen treatment\nHypoxic brain injury is common following cardiac arrest. This trial therefore tried to determine if a restrictive oxygen strategy would benefit patients following cardiac arrest\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nRandomisation using web-based system using variable block sizes that were stratified by site\nNon-blinded\n2*2 factorial design\n\nPatients also randomised to higher or lower MAP target, with results presented here\n\n\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\nCognitive assessment tests completed via telephone interview\n732 patients would provide 80% power to detect an absolute difference of 10% for the primary outcome assuming a mortality of 28% at a 2 sided alpha level of 0.05\nIntention to treat analysis\nPaO2 measured at pre-determined time points\n\nSetting\n\n2 tertiary cardiac arrest centres, Denmark\nData collected March 2017 \u2013 December 2021\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac causes\nSustained ROSC >20 minutes\nGCS <8\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nPresumed non-cardiac cause\n>4 hours from ROSC to screening\nSBP <80 despite medical optimisation\n\n\n802 patients enrolled\n\n789 patients analysed in intention to treat analysis (consent declined in 12 and 1 patient randomised twice)\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of restrictive vs. liberal group\n\nAge: 62 vs 63\nMale: 83% vs 79%\nMedical history\n\nMyocardial infarction: 23% vs 21%\nHeart failure: 15% vs 20%\nStroke: 8% vs 7%\nChronic kidney disease: 5% vs 5%\n\n\nOut-of-hospital arrest\n\nShockable rhythm: 85% vs 85%\nWitnessed arrest: 85% vs 86%\nBystander CPR: 89% vs 86%\n1st defib by automated external defibrillator: 21% vs 26%\n\n\nFinding/procedures at hospital arrival\n\npH: 7.21 vs 7.21\nPaO2: 16.1 vs 17.1 kPa\nImmediate coronary angiography: 92% vs 91%\nPercutaneous coronary intervention: 40% vs 45%\n\n\nMedian time from cardiac arrest to randomisation 146 minutes (IQR 113-187)\nSeparation of oxygenation levels was seen within 2-4 hours and remained through the first 48 hours\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nRestrictive oxygenation\n\nTarget PaO2 of 9-10 kPa (68 -75 mmHg)\nInitial FiO2 set at 0.3\n\n\n\nControl\n\nLiberal oxygenation\n\nTarget PaO2 of 13-14 kPa (98 \u2013 105 mmHg)\nInitial FiO2 set at 0.6\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll patients underwent temperature control at 36C for at least 24 hours using surface cooling or intravenous cooling\nTarget oxygenation interventions were initiated immediately after randomisation and maintained until extubation\nFiO2 adjusted to achieve target PaO2, but increased if SpO2 <93%\nVentilator settings at discretion of treating physician\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Composite of death or discharge from hospital with severe disability or coma (Cerebral Performance Category of 3 or 4) within 90 days of randomisation \u2013 no significant difference\n\n32.0% in restrictive vs 33.9% in liberal\nHazard ratios 0.95 (95% CI 0.75-1.21), p=0.69\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nComparing restrictive vs. liberal

ratio 0.85 (95% CI 0.69-1.03)\n\n\nMedian CPC at 90 days: 1 vs 1\nMedian score on Montreal Cognitive Assessment at 90 days: 27 vs 27\nMedian neuron-specific enolase at 48 hours: 17 vs 18mcg/L\nAdverse events\n\nInfection: 26% vs 28%\nArrhythmia: 15% vs 13%\nUncontrolled bleeding: 4% vs 5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSub-group analysis\n\nPrimary outcome consistent across pre-specified subgroups and no interaction with BP intervention\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn comatose patients who had been resuscitated after out of hospital cardiac arrest, there was no difference between a restrictive and liberal oxygenation target with respect to in death or severe disability or coma at 90 days\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nIntention to treat analysis\nWell balanced baseline characteristics\nPaO2 measured at pre-determined time points, and clear separation of PaO2 achieved\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOpen-label\nStudy only performed in 2 centres in 1 country\nPatients in liberal oxygenation strategy treated with higher levels of PEEP\nRestrictive group had a mean PaO2 close to 10 kPa (Figure 1A), some even without additional oxygen supplementation\n\nThis was the upper limit of the restrictive group\n\n\nThe PaO2 was ~16 and 17 kPa in both groups at randomisation\n\nThe authors comment that any suggestions that more aggressive or even pre-hospital interventions may have changed outcome are speculative\nThis would be supported by the recently published EXACT trial \u2013 this showed no difference in hospital survival when a SpO2 of 90 to 94% was compared to 98-100% in the pre-hospital setting\n\n\nPower calculation based on a reduction in the primary outcome from 28 to 18%\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest targeting a PaO2 of 9-10 kPa compared with a PaO2 of 13-14 kPa did not affect mortality or likelihood of discharge from hospital with a poor neurological outcome\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Oxygen Targets in Comatose
