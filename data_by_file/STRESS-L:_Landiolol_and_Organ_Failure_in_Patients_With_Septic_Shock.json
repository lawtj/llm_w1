JAMA Published online October 25, 2023. doi:10.1001/jama.2023.20134\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with tachycardia and septic shock who are treated with high dose norepinephrine does the use of \u03b2-blockade for up to 14 days reduce organ failure compared to standard care?\n\nBackground\n\nMany view the use of \u03b2-blockade as contentious in septic patients\nA meta-analysis has shown that ultra-short acting \u03b2-blockade reduced 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis and persistent tachycardia\nIt is thought that tachycardia may be driven by sympathetic overstimulation\nThis has multiple deleterious effects leading to impaired V-A coupling and worsening myocardial efficiency. These include:\n\nReduced diastolic duration (which is important for ventricular filling alongside coronary perfusion)\nIncreased myocardial oxygen demand and cardiac work leading to reduced myocardial performance (this may be exacerbated with the use of vasoconstrictors)\n\n\nOther potential beneficial effects may include immunomodulation \u2013 a reduction in production of proinflammatory cytokines has been shown in animals\nLandiolol is a very short acting \u03b2-blocker with ~8x the selectivity for \u03b21 receptors (compared to esmolol)\n\n80% of \u03b2-receptors in the heart are \u03b21\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nParallel group, investigator-initiated, multicenter RCT\nOpen-label, phase 2b trial\n\nInvestigators blinded to all data during trial\n\n\nPatients screened on initiation of norepinephrine to allow a 24-hour window for written consent\nAllocated 1:1 ratio using a computerized system\n\nMinimised by site and norepinephrine dose\n\n\nInterim analysis by data monitoring committee (DMC) every 3 months with no formal stopping rules (for either futility or benefit)\nClear pre-specified adherence criteria\nPrimary outcome was mean SOFA score over first 14 days following entry into trial and whilst in ICU\n\nNeurological domain not used due to sedation\n\n\nPlanned sample size of 340 patients\n\nBased on mean SOFA score of 6.3 over first 14 days, and a predicted effect size of a 1-point difference between groups\n\n\nTrial terminated early by DMC as unlikely to demonstrate benefit and potential signal for harm\n\nSetting\n\n40 NHS hospitals in the UK\nApril 2018 \u2013 December 2021\n\nPaused from March 2020 until August 2020 due to COVID-19\n\n\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n> 18 years old\nIn ICU with septic shock (SEPSIS-3 criteria)\n> 0.1 mcg/kg/min norepinephrine for > 24 hours (< 72 hours)\nHR \u2265 95 bpm\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nTachycardia felt to be due to pain / discomfort\nNon-infective vasodilatory shock\n\n\n4137 screened \u2013> 348 eligible\n\n126 randomised (222 declined participation)\n63 to landiolol and 63 to standard care\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of landiolol vs standard care groups\n\nAge: 55.9 vs 55.3\nFemale: 41 vs 41%\nSource\n\nPulmonary: 44.4 vs 42.9%\nAbdominal: 33.3 vs 34.9%\n\n\nReceived \u03b2-blockers 2 weeks prior: 14.3 vs 16.7%\nMean hydrocortisone equivalent dose: 170.6 mg in 33 patients vs 176.7 mg in 37 patients\nMean HR: 110 vs 114\nMean Norepinephrine dose: 0.37 vs 0.36 mcg/kg/min\nMean SOFA score: 10.1 vs 10.3\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nLandiolol Infusion\n\nStarted at 1mcg/kg/min and up titrated every 15 minutes in 1mcg/kg/min increments to achieve HR of 80 \u2013 94 within 6 hours\nDose reduced by the same decrement if HR < 80\nWeaned off once all vasopressors weaned off > 12 hours\n\n\nMedian duration was 2 days (0.8 \u2013 3.9)\n\nControl\n\nNo \u03b2-blockade\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nBoth groups received standard care based on SSC guidelines\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome (mean SOFA score):\n\nNo difference\nLandiolol 8.8 (3.9) vs Standard Care 8.1 (3.2)\n\nMean Difference 0.75 [95% CI -0.49 \u2013 2.0, p = 0.24]\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nComparing Landiolol vs. Standard Care group\n\nNo significant difference in\n\n28-day mortality\n\n37.1% vs 25.4%\nOR 1.76 (95% CI 0.77 \u2013 4.03, p = 0.18)\n\n\n90-day mortality\n\n43.5% vs 28.6%\nOR 2.04 (95% CI 0.91 \u2013 4.57, p = 0.8)\n\n\nICU or hospital LOS in survivors\nMean Lactate, PaO2, PaCO2\n\n\nSignificantly increased in landiolol group\n\nSerious Adverse Events\n\nLandiolol 25.4% vs Standard Care 6.4% p =.006\n\n\nAverage Norepinephrine Infusion Rate\n\n0.34 vs 0.24 mcg/kg/min (Mean Difference 0.10 95% CI 0.002 \u2013 0.20, p = .05)\n\n\n\n\nSignificantly reduced in landiolol group\n\nHR over 14 days\n\n92.4 vs 98.6 (Mean Difference -6.46 95% CI -10.46 to -2.46, p = 0.02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo differences in any subgroup (norepinephrine dose > 0.3 mcg/kg/min, ARDS or beta blocker use prior to randomisation)\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with septic shock and tachycardia an infusion of landiolol did not improve organ function, and the results do not support its use in the management of patients with tachycardia whilst receiving norepinephrine for septic shock\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised trial\nScreening log kept, and process to screen patients prior to meeting inclusion criteria to ensure timely randomisation sensible given need for written consent\nClear guidelines to determine adherence to landiolol administration protocol\nUnwell patient cohort with high mean doses of norepinephrine and heart rates\nPre-published protocol\nIntention to treat analysis\nWell balanced baseline characteristics\nLow rates of protocol not being followed (7.9%)\n\nThis is impressive in a trial with an intervention requiring frequent titration of therapy in sick cohort in whom there are likely a lot of other competing management priorities\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOpen-label\nHigh rates screened but then not deemed eligible for \u201cother\u201d reasons (n = 1784, 47% of all those who were screened and excluded)\nPrimary outcome\n\nNon-patient focused\nThe authors acknowledge it doesn\u2019t deal well with death or discharge from ICU (a discharged or dead patient will not have SOFA score recorded), however sensitivity analyses showed no difference\n\nThis used a ranked composite of death and SOFA score\n\n\n\n\nNo mandated cardiac monitoring or data collection on cardiac performance\n\nThis could be used to identify sub-groups who may benefit (e.g. LVOT obstruction) or be harmed by the intervention (e.g. RV dysfunction)\n\n\nEarly cessation may limit power to describe clinically important effects\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI will not be using ultra-short acting \u03b21-blockade on septic patients with a noradrenaline requirement and tachycardia.\nThe use of \u03b2-blockade in this setting should be confined to clinical trials\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Landiolol and Organ Failure in Patients With Septic Shock The STRESS-L Randomized Clinical
