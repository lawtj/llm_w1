In patients with cerebral atrophy the onset of symptoms may be insidious and may be detected some time after a minor head trauma or be associated with anticoagulation therapy\nThe management of chronic SDH includes surgical evacuation of the clot if there is evidence of neurological deterioation or if the clot is >10mm or is causing midline shift of >5mm\nSystemic reviews of the use of glucocorticoids in CSDH have suggested that they reduce the chance of clot recurrence however the effect on neurological outcome is not known to date\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial: 1:1 randomisation of a 14 day tapering course of dexamethasone OR placebo\nPermuted blocks (random block sizes of 2 or 4) with stratification according to trial site\nAllocation concealment achieved via a web-based allocation tool\nDouble-blinding: both the treating clinicians and outcome assessors were unaware of the allocation\nPowered to allow for a 15% loss to follow-up. Target sample size of 750 patients would allow a 81-92% power to detect a treatment effect of 8 percentage points\nConsent obtained from the patient or next-of-kin\nAn independent data monitoring committee and ethics committee reviewed the trial at 6-12 monthly intervals\n\nSetting\n\n23 sites in the United Kingdom\nPatients were enrolled from August 2015 to November 2018, with 6-month follow-up completed by mid 2019.\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Patients >18 years with a symptomatic CSDH seen as a hypodense or isodense crescentic collection on the CT head\nExclusion:\n\nGlucocorticoids were contraindicated\nGlucocorticoids were indicated for other medical conditions\nCSF shunt in situ\nHistory of psychotic disorder\nPatients with acute SDH\nPatients who were unable to receive the trial drug within 72 hours after admission\n\n\n2203 were screened for eligibility. 750 were randomised to a trial group (2 were subsequently deemed not eligible). So 748 patients were enrolled with 375 in the dexamethasone group and 373 in the placebo group\n45 patients withdrew consent and 23 were lost to follow-up leaving 680 patients in the modified intention to treat analysis\nPatients were well matched at baseline: they were predominantly elderly males (74 years, 74% male) with the most common presenting symptoms being headache and gait disturbance, with head trauma historically noted in around 70% of cases. 47% were on some form of antithrombotic medication\n\nIntervention\n\nDexamethasone\n\n2-week course of oral dexamethasone\n\n8mg bd Day 1-3, 6mg bd Day 4-6, 4mg bd on Day 7-9, 2mg bd on Day 10-12 then 2mg daily on Day 13-14. (If the patient could not swallow they had NG delivery of the dexamethasone)\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nMatched placebo\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nOther management was at the discretion of the treating clinicians and was not protocolised\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: 6 month modified rankin score (MRS) \u2013 significantly better outcomes in placebo group\n\nThis scale has 7 categories. 0=no symptoms, 1=no clinically significant disability despite symptoms, 2=slight disability, 3=moderate disability, 4=moderately severe disability, 5=severe disability, 6=death\nComparing dexamethasone vs. placebo group\n\nA favourable outcome, (MRS of 0-3)\n\n83.9% vs. 90.3% \u00a0(-6.4% difference, 95% CI -11.4 to -1.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: Comparing intervention vs. control group\n\nSignificantly better outcomes in control group\n\nMRS 0-3 at 3 months\n\n83.2% vs 91.4% (-8.2%, 95% CI -13.3 to -3.1)\n\n\nMortality at 30 days\n\n2.1% vs 0.5% (OR 4.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 27.2)\n\n\n\n\nNo significant difference in\n\nMRS 0-3 at discharge from neurosurgical unit\n\n80.2% vs 83.2%, (-3% 95% CI -9.1 to 3)\n\n\nMortality at 6 months\n\n8.8% vs 5%, (OR 1.83, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.45)\n\n\nSurgical intervention in the index admission\n\n91.7% vs 89.2%\n\n\nSurgical intervention in a subsequent admission\n\n5.1% vs 7.6%\n\n\n\n\nSignificantly reduced in intervention group\n\nRepeat surgery for recurrence of subdural haematoma\n\n1.7% vs 7.1% (-5.4%, 95% CI -8.7 to -2.5)\n\n\n\n\nAdverse events \u2013 significantly more likely in the dexamethasone group\n\nAdverse events of special interest\n\n10.9% vs 3.2%\n\n\nSerious adverse events up to Day 30\n\n16% vs 6.4% (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.54-4.15)\n\n\nSubdural empyema more common in dexamethasone group\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with symptomatic chronic subdural haematoma, treatment with dexamethasone resulted in fewer favourable outcomes and more adverse events compared with placebo. However, recurrence of the subdural haematoma, requiring repeat surgery was less likely in the dexamethasone group\n\nStrengths\n\nAllocation concealment\nBlinding\nPatients were analysed in the group they were allocated to even if they didn\u2019t receive the therapy\nAnalysis was by modified intention to treat, excluding those who withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up\nMulti-centre study improving external validity of results\nThe study picked a clinically meaningful outcome as the primary outcome. Previous studies of dexamethasone in CSDH had used recurrence of SDH as the outcome which is not as important to the patient as neurological recovery\n\nWeaknesses\n\nLoss to follow-up or withdrawal of consent in 9% which was accounted for in the power calculation\n10 patients assigned to the dexamethasone group did not receive this\n12 patients assigned to placebo received dexamethasone\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPatients with chronic subdural haematoma should not be treated with dexamethasone\nThis study is reassuring that my usual practice of not using dexamethasone in this cohort is the correct approach\n\nExternal Links\n\nTrial of Dexamethasone for Chronic Subdural Haematoma\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford @celiabradford\nSummary date: 12/1/21\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
