The bolus of heparin was not given if the patient had a) already received one b) received therapeutic LMWH (heparin infusion also delayed until 12 hours after last injection) or c) fondaparinux (heparin infusion also delayed until 24 hours after the last injection). APTR target of 2-2.5\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Death or haemodynamic decompensation within 7 days \u2013 Significantly lower in thrombolysis group\n\n2.6% in thrombolysis group vs. 5.6% in placebo group (OR 0.44, 95% C.I 0.23-0.87, P=0.02, NNT 34)\ndefinition of haemodynamic decompensation as per definition in exclusion criteria\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nMortality at 7 days and 30 days \u2013 No significant difference\n\n7 days: 1.2% vs. 1.8% (OR 0.65, 95% C.I. 0.23-1.85, P=0.42)\n30 days: 2.4% vs. 3.2% (OR 0.73, 95% C.I. 0.34-1.57, P=0.42)\n\n\nHaemodynamic decompensation \u2013 Significantly lower in thrombolysis group\n\n1.6% vs. 5% (OR 0.3, 95% C.I. 0.14-0.68, P=0.002, NNT 30)\n= 1 or more of: need for CPR; BP <90mmHg for >15min; drop of systolic BP >40mmHg for >15min with signs of end-organ hypoperfusion; need for catecholamine infusion (excluding dopamine at <5mcg/kg/min)\n\n\nMajor extracranial bleeding \u2013 Significantly higher in thrombolysis group\n\n6.3% vs. 1.2% (OR 5.55, 95% C.I. 2.3-13.39, P<0.001, NNH 19)\n\n\nHaemorrhagic stroke \u2013 Significantly higher in thrombolysis group\n\n2% vs 0.2% (P=0.003, NNH 55)\n\n\nIn patients who were treated with thrombolysis\n\nPatients who were >75 years had a non-significant increase in the rate of major extra-cranial bleeding compared with patients who were\u00a0\u226475 years\n\n11.1% vs. 4.1% (P=0.09)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with intermediate-risk PE thrombolysis prevented haemodynamic decompensation but increased the risk of major bleeding and stroke\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised\nDouble-blinded\nMulti-centre\nLarge number of patients\nAppropriate sample size calculation\n\nWeaknesses\n\nComposite outcome of death and haemodynamic decompensation is not helpful.\u00a0Clinicians (and patients!) do not consider death and haemodynamic decompensation equal. An appropriately powered study which determines mortality or morbidity (chronic pulmonary hypertension) is what is needed.\nHaemodynamic decompensation or collapse was recorded in 26 (2.58%) of the 1005 patients. Only 17 (1.58%) of the 1005 patients required catecholamine support. Whilst this reached statisitical significance, it is questionable as to how clinically relevant \u2018haemodynamic decompensation\u2019 is as an outcome when a) over a 1/3 of these patients did not require catecholamines at any point during the 7 days post randomisation b) the incidence is so low in both groups (albeit higher in the placebo arm) c) there was no apparent difference in mortality d) evidence of persistent organ dysfunction or time to resolution was not recorded\nNot powered to determine mortality benefit\nThe inclusion criteria of up to 15 days for randomisation is long and perhaps the risk of using tenecteplase would outweigh any potential benefits at this stage\nThere was a higher rate of pre-randomisation use of LMWH/fondaparinux in the tenectaplase group\n\nBoehringer helped fund trial. However, they had no role in the design, conduct, analysis or reporting of the trial\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with sub-massive PE, the administration of a bolus of tenecteplase results in only a modest haemodynamic benefit and no reduction in 30 day mortality. Furthermore, it\u2019s use is associated with a 10-fold increase in intracranial haemorrhage (2% vs. 0.2%) and a 5-fold increase in major haemorrhage (6.3% vs. 1.2%). This study does not support the use of thrombolysis in submassive PE.\n\n\n\nLinks\nabstract\u00a0/ doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1302097\nMayEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\nLife in the fast lane\nAcademic life in EM\n\nMetadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0@DavidSlessor\nSummary date: 21 June 2014\n\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@stevemathieu75\n\n\n\n"
