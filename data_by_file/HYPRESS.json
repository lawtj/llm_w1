Published online October 3, 2016.doi:10.1001/jama.2016.14799\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with severe sepsis does hydrocortisone compared to placebo prevent the development of septic shock?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial\nInternet-based randomisation stratified by participating centre and sex\nThe\u00a0randomization used the Pocock minimization algorithm to ensure balanced 1:1 randomization in the strata at any time\nAll patients, study personnel, staff were blinded for the entire study\nIntention to treat (and per protocol) analysis\nAssuming 40% of the patients in the placebo group would develop septic shock, to detect a 15% difference with the intervention arm (p<0.05, power of 80%), 169 patients per arm were required. Accounting for a drop out of ~10%, 190 patients per arm (380 total) were included.\n\nSetting\n\n34 study sites in Germany\nJanuary 13 2009 to August 27 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nEvidence of infection (1 of: micro-organism identified in normally sterile body fluid, identified focus of infection, granulocytes in sterile\u00a0body fluid, clinically suspected infection without microbiological evidence)\nEvidence of SIRS (2 of: fever >38\u00b0C or hypothermia <36\u00b0C, tachycardia >90bpm, tachypnea >20/min or CO2<33mmHg or mechanically ventilated, leukocytosis >12000/ul or leucopenia <4000/ul or >10% immature forms)\nEvidence of Organ Dysfunction for not longer than 48 hours (1 of: encephalopathy, AKI, coagulopathy, pulmonary dysfunction, microcirculatory dysfunction)\nInformed consent possible from patient or NOK\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nPatients with septic shock, ie patients who are hypotensive despite adequate fluid resuscitation (MAP<65Hg, SBP<90mmHg) or those needing vasopressors for more than 4 hours. Transient use of vasopressors ok whilst fluid resuscitation occurs.\nPatients with hypersensitivity to the hydrocortisone or placebo (mannitol)\nPatients regularly on glucocorticoids\nPatients with a condition\u00a0indicating glucocorticoid therapy\nDNR or moribund patients\n<18 years\nRecent trial participation (30 days)\nPregnant/Breast-feeding\nRelated to study personnel\n\n\nPatients were NOT EXCLUDED for using etomidate or a short course of glucocorticoids\u00a0within 72 hours before enrollment OR using topical or inhaled glucocorticoids\n9953 patients\u00a0with severe sepsis or septic shock\u00a0were screened and 380 randomized to receive hydrocortisone n=190 or placebo n=190\n\nIntervention\n\nBolus of hydrocortisone iv 50mg followed by a 24 hour continuous infusion of 200mg for 5 days, 100mg for Day 6 & 7, 50mg on Day 8 & 9 and 25mg on Day 10 & 11\n\nThe continuous infusion was preferred to prevent unwanted undulation in blood glucose concentrations\n\n\n\nControl\n\nThe placebo was lyophilized mannitol which was indistinguishable from the hydrocortisone (133mg mannitol \u2013 a tiny dose compared with therapeutic mannitol for raised ICP = 1g/kg)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: the occurrence of septic shock within 14 days, which was assessed daily until day 14 or discharge from ICU\n\nThe intention to treat analysis excluded 27 patients \u2013 consent issues, septic shock at inclusion, or did not receive study medication\nIn the ITT population: shock occurred in 36/170 (21.2%)\u00a0patients in the hydrocortisone group vs 39/170 (22.9%)\u00a0patients in the placebo group (p=0.70, Difference= -1.8% 95% CI -10.7% to 7.2%)\nIn the per-protocol analysis there was no difference in development of septic shock\nSubgroup analysis: medical vs surgical patients, pneumonia, those receiving study medication for> 48hrs did not reveal any benefit for shock prevention\n\n\nSecondary outcome: No differences between groups:\n\nTime until development of septic shock or death\nMortality in ICU and hospital\nVital status at Day 28, 90 & 180\nDuration of ICU and hospital stay\nSOFA score\nDuration of mechanical ventilation\nRRT\n\n\nIn 206 patients, baseline cortisol concentration was checked and\u00a0the level rechecked following administration of 250ug corticotropin. The primary and secondary\u00a0outcomes in this subgroup were evaluated \u2013 33.5% of these patients had CIRCI (Critical Illness Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency). No difference in primary or secondary endpoints between patients with or without CIRCI\nAdverse events assessed included muscle strength\u00a0scores, secondary infection, hyperglycaemia, gastrointestinal bleeding,\u00a0delirium\u00a0and weaning failure. There were more episodes of hyperglycaemia in the hydrocortisone group but the total amount of insulin delivered was not significantly different. Delirium was less common in the hydrocortisone group (placebo group 24.5% vs hydrocortisone group 11.2%, p=0.01). The other adverse events did not differ between groups.\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAdministration of hydrocortisone did not prevent the development of shock in patients with severe sepsis.\n\nStrengths\n\nAn important question: the use of steroids in sepsis and septic shock is one of the longest running debates in critical care. This trial uniquely\u00a0examines the use of steroids to prevent shock in patients with established sepsis.\nAllocation concealment\nBlinding\nIntention to treat analysis\n<5% lost to follow-up\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPatients who developed septic shock early may have been missed because informed consent was necessary before randomisation\nThe mortality rate in this trial was relatively low (8.5% at Day 28) so this was a relatively well cohort compared to other sepsis trials (reflecting the haemodynamic stability of the\u00a0patients at the time of randomization)\nNot all patients had baseline adrenal function assessed. Only certain sites did this test and it needed to be done before randomization occurred.\nEtomidate was used in 6.3%\u00a0(placebo group)\u00a0and 6.8% (hydrocortisone group)\u00a0of patients pre-randomization. Etomidate selectively inhibits adrenal corticosteroid synthesis which may impact the overall result\nPatients in the placebo arm were more likely to have received glucocorticoids pre-randomization and at higher doses (3.4% vs 1.7%, 600mg vs 200mg), but the number of patients involved was small.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAs a non-believer in\u00a0the use of steroids in sepsis and septic shock I will continue my current practice of not using steroids in this setting.\nI am\u00a0working at a hospital actively recruiting for the ADRENAL trial. 3800 patients with septic shock\u00a0are being recruited in a placebo-controlled trial\u00a0to assess 90 day mortality. I keenly await these results which may put this question to rest forever!\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0HYPRESS RCT\n[further reading]\u00a0ADRENAL trial protocol\n[further reading]\u00a0Podcast: Cohen Steroids in Sepsis\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Celia Bradford\nSummary date:\u00a0October 12 2016\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
