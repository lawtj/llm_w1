JAMA; 328(3):270-279. doi:10.1001/jama.2022.9792\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill adult patients undergoing tracheal intubation and positive pressure ventilation, does intravenous infusion of a 500ml fluid bolus vs no fluid bolus, decrease the incidence of cardiovascular collapse during, or shortly after the procedure?\n\nBackground\n\nTracheal intubation in the intensive care unit is a common intervention that entails significant risk\nHaemodynamic instability, in the form of hypotension, increased vasopressor requirement or cardiac arrest, is a common complication, occurring in around 25% of intubations in the critical care setting, compared with only 4% in the theatre setting\nThere are a number of potential causes, including loss of sympathetic tone, increased intrathoracic pressure and the use of anaesthetic induction agents\nA simple potential intervention would be a fluid bolus to increase intravascular filling\n\u00a0 The only prior study on this intervention was PREPARE, which was stopped early due to futility\nA post hoc subgroup analysis of PREPARE found a potential benefit in patients undergoing positive pressure ventilation during the intubation process\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, randomised, unblinded trial\n1:1 randomisation to intervention and control in randomly permuted block sizes of 2, 4 and 6; stratified by trial site\nInformed consent was obtained after the intervention\nSample size calculation: 1065 patients would give 80% power to detect a between group relative difference of 35%\nPrimary outcome was cardiovascular collapse, defined as one or more of:\n\nNew or increased receipt of vasopressors between induction and 2 minutes after tracheal intubation\nSystolic blood pressure of less than 65 mmHg between induction and 2 minutes after tracheal intubation\nCardiac arrest between induction and 1 hour after tracheal intubation\nDeath between induction and 1 hour after tracheal intubation\n\n\nSole pre-specified secondary outcome was in-hospital mortality by day 28\n\nSetting\n\n11 intensive care units in the US\nEnrollment occurred between February 2019 and May 2021\nEnrollment paused between February 2020 and August 2020 due to Covid-19 pandemic\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdult patients over 18 years old\nUndergoing tracheal intubation, with a plan to use\n\nAnaesthetic induction agents\nPositive pressure ventilation during induction and prior to direct laryngoscopy\n\n\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nImmediate need for intubation\n\nThese cases were deemed too urgent to allow time for randomisation\n\n\nIf the intubating clinician felt the intervention was either indicated or contra-indicated\nPregnancy\nIncarceration\n\n\n1576 patients screened\n\n1065 randomised\n\n538 fluid bolus\n527 no fluid bolus\n\n\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of fluid bolus vs. no fluid bolus group\n\nMedian age (years): 61 vs 62\nFemale Sex (%): 41 vs 43\nBMI (kg/m\u00b2): 28 vs 28\nComorbidities (%):\n\nDiabetes: 26 vs 29\nHypertension: 34 vs 34\nCOPD: 19 vs 17\nCongestive cardiac failure: 15 vs 14\nRenal failure: 4 vs 6\n\n\nIndications for intubation (%)\n\nHypoxia: 41 vs 43\nHypercarbia: 7 vs 8\nHypoxia and hypercarbia: 11 vs 11\nLow GCS: 20 vs 20\n\n\nUse of vasopressors (%): 20.0 vs 19.4\nReceiving IV fluids at enrollment (%): 10.2 vs 9.9\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nFluid bolus group\n\n500mls of isotonic crystalloid solution, intravenously\nAim to infuse as much as possible of the 500mls before induction of anaesthesia, without delaying tracheal intubation\nComplete infusion of any remaining fluid after induction, during tracheal intubation\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNo fluid bolus group\n\nInitiation of fluid bolus not permitted, except\n\nAs treatment for hypotension\nIf operator determined that fluid bolus was necessary for patient safety\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll other aspects of care at clinicians\u2019 discretion\nSpecifically\n\nOngoing IV fluid infusions could be continued\nVasopressors to treat hypotension\nChoice of induction agent\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: incidence of cardiovascular collapse \u2013 no significant difference\n\n21.0% in fluid bolus group vs 18.2% in no fluid bolus group\n\nAbsolute difference 2.8%, 95% CI -2.2% to 7,7%\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome: in-hospital mortality at 28 days \u2013 no significant difference\n\n40.5% in fluid bolus group vs 42.3% in no fluid bolus group\n\n\nNo difference in any of the prespecified exploratory outcomes\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation with positive pressure ventilation, a fluid bolus during induction of anaesthesia did not decrease the incidence of cardiovascular collapse, compared with no fluid bolus\n\nStrengths\n\nPragmatic, randomised design\nClinically relevant question with an easily implemented intervention\nConclusions seem to be broadly generalisable, with patient characteristics that seem very similar to patients on my unit\n\nCo-morbidities\nAcute presentation\nIndications for intubation\n\n\nUse of composite outcome increases probability of finding a clinically important difference\nVery impressive implementation of interventions, and separation between the two groups\n\n99.4% of fluid bolus group received bolus, compared with 1.1% in no fluid bolus group\nMedian of 500mls of fluid administered in fluid bolus group at 2 minutes after intubation, compared with 0mls in no fluid bolus group\nLowest volume administered was 300mls\n\n\nOnly a small variation in fluid management between the the two groups following induction\n\nA large variation could have introduced bias\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOne could argue that fluid administration does not address the main causes of cardiovascular collapse during intubation\n\ni.e. the hypothesis lacks face validity\n\n\nThe selection of induction agents is not representative of the agents used in most units outside the US\nIssues with using a composite outcome:\n\nThe components of the composite outcome are not all equally important\n\nfor example, cardiac arrest is devastating compared to an episode of hypotension\n\n\nThe components of the composite outcome are not all patient-centred\n\npatients unlikely to be effected by an episode of hypotension or increased dose of vasopressor\n\n\nSome elements of the composite outcome susceptible to bias\n\nOperators\u2019 use of vasopressors may be affected by the trial intervention\nIncreased use of vasopressors may not reflect genuine cardiovascular collapse or hypotension\n\n\n\n\nUnblinded trial \u2013 could it have been possible, albeit more difficult, to blind clinicians to the intervention?\nLarge proportion of patients (15%) were excluded due to urgency \u2013 potential cause of bias\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe routine administration of isotonic crystolloid solution during induction of anaesthesia and intubation does not reduce the incidence of cardiovascular collapse\nI will continue to assess my patients\u2019 fluid status on a case by case basis, and will only administer a fluid bolus in patients who display convincing evidence of hypovolaemia\nI will continue to proactively administer a dose of vasopressor during induction in patients who I consider at particular risk of cardiovascular collapse\n\nExternal Links\n\nEffect of Fluid Bolus Administration on Cardiovascular Collapse Among Critically Ill Patients Undergoing Tracheal Intubation\nTrial
