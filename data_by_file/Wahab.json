Journal of the Intensive Care Society. 2016, Vol. 17(1) 2\u201311\nClinical Question\n\nDoes early rehabilitation reduce physical impairment and ICU length of stay in critically ill patients?\n\nDesign\n\nMulticenter\nBefore / after cohort study\nRetrospective analysis\nNo blinding\nData was summarised using standard descriptive statistics with unpaired t-tests used to compare continuous variables and chi-squared tests to compare categorical variables. Differences in length of stay (LOS) were calculated using Poisson\u2019s regression\n\nSetting\n\n5 ICU\u2019s (3 medical, 1 cardiac, 1 surgical) across 2 affiliated hospital in US\nData collected before and after implementation of the early rehabilitation programme\n\nJan 2011 \u2013 Dec 2011 & Jan 2012 \u2013 Dec 2012\n\n\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: All patients admitted to ICU\nExclusion: None stated\n8145 patients\nBaseline characteristics were similar: mean age 63 years, 55% male, and 80% medical admissions\n\nIntervention\n\nEarly rehabilitation programme\n\n4200 patients\nConsisted of a multidisciplinary team including physicians, nurses, physician assistants and acute care nurse practitioners, as well as physical, occupational, respiratory and speech and language therapists\nReviewed patients daily Monday to Saturday\nRehabilitation activities included:\n\n\nPhysical therapy: passive movement, exercises in bed, transfers (supine to sitting, sitting to standing, bed to chair) and ambulation\nOccupational therapy: feeding grooming and dressing\nOne or more therapists were involved as well as a rehabilitation therapy assistant if required\nAaditional staff were available if patients were mobilised whilst mechanically ventilated or were on ECMO\n\nGuidelines for rehabilitation including contraindications were adapted from existing literature and treatment could be deferred at the discretion of the team\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard care prior to early rehabilitation programme\n\n3945 patients\nPhysical or occupational therapy was usually done within one day of a patient being medically appropriate for transfer out of ICU to the ward\nPhysical therapy referral was rarely requested when a patient was endotracheally intubated\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: The implementation of the rehabilitation programme resulted in the following changes:\n\nICU LOS: 4 out of 5 ICU\u2019s had a statistically significant decreased mean LOS\n\noverall mean LOS 5.4 vs 5.8 days (p<0.001)\nno change in pre- and post-implementation ICU LOS in the subgroups of patients who were fully independent, intermediate, or fully dependent in their pre-admission activity and mobility\n\n\nHospital LOS: statistically significantly decreased mean LOS\n\noverall mean LOS 13.9 vs 14.7 days (p<0.001)\n\n\nNumber of admissions to ICU increased across all five ICUs\n\n\u00a0255 (6.5%) more admissions\n\n\n\n\nMean number of rehabilitation treatments per ICU: increased more than 4-fold\n\n0.16 to 0.72 per ICU patient-day\n\n\nAmbulation: patients ambulated with physical therapist support on ICU more frequently\n\n15% vs 50% of patients ambulated at least once during their ICU stay (p<0.001)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nA multi-ICU, coordinated implementation of an early rehabilitation programme markedly increased rehabilitation treatments in the ICU and was associated with reduced ICU and hospital LOS as well as increased ICU admissions\n\nStrengths\n\nLarge study numbers\nAn important study evaluating the effects of regular rehabilitation provision on intensive care\nBaseline characteristics for both patient groups was similar\nBaseline mobility and activity scores were similar\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRetrospective analysis\n3 years from completion of study to publication\nNo data supplied about:\n\nseverity of illness score\norgan support\nrange or median length of stay\nelective vs. emergency surgery\n\n\nLack of detailed information about the rehabilitation activities performed in the pre- and post-implementation periods\nVariability in the number of rehabilitation treatments per ICU patient-day (0.58-0.98)\nNo data about longer term physical or psychological effects of early rehabilitation\nLack of sedation protocols may have resulted in variability with the ICU length of stay\nAlthough not a weakness in the methodology, it is worth highlighting that 19 new specialist staff were employed as part of this quality improvement project. With 80 beds across 5 ICU\u2019s, this equates to 1:4 therapist:patient ratio. This high ratio of therapists is unlikely to be generalisable in UK practice\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nEarly rehabilitation for patients on ICU makes logical sense and this retrospective study supports the implementation of a critical care rehabilitation programme. However, with less than half a day reduction in ICU stay (which might also be attributed to other factors), it would be difficult to justify such a large scale recruitment of therapists. The descriptive statistics are however informative and perhaps it can be used to compare against our own therapy provision. Future RCT studies looking at longer term outcome measures\u00a0(physical, psychological and patient experience)\u00a0would be helpful, particularly in\u00a0formulating larger scale programmes and\u00a0cost analysis through QUALY data\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0The implementation of an early rehabilitation program is associated with reduced length of stay: A multi-ICU study\n[further reading] Mobilisation in the ICU by LITFL\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @stevemathieu75\nSummary date: 25th January 2016\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n"
