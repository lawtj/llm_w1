JAMA 2024. 10.1001/jama.2024.9779\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill adult patients with presumed sepsis, does the administration of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics via a continuous infusion compared to an intermittent infusion reduce 90-day mortality?\n\nBackground\n\n\u03b2-lactam antibiotics have time-dependent bactericidal activity\nIt is hypothesised that improved antibiotic exposure with continuous infusion will lead to longer time above MIC, with potentially improved bacterial eradication\nAdditionally, underdosing may occur in sepsis due to:\n\nIncreased cardiac output with potentially increased drug clearance\nCapillary leak and increased volume of distribution\n\n\nBLING II (2015) showed no difference in alive ICU-free days at day 28 between continuous and intermittent administration of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics\nMERCY (2023) showed a non-significant 2% reduction in mortality in with continuous infusions of Meropenem\n\nDesign\n\nMulticentre, multinational randomised controlled trial\nRandomisation 1:1 via an online minimisation algorithm\n\nStratified by study site\n\n\nOpen label\nPower calculation guided by BLING II\n\nSample size of 7000 required to achieve 90% power to detect 3.5% difference in all-cause mortality at 90 days including 5% loss to follow up\nAssumption of baseline mortality of 27.5%, at \u03b1 of 0.05\n\n\nModified intention-to-treat analysis for primary end point\nPrespecified adjusted analysis accounting for sex, APACHE II score, source of admission (emergency vs elective surgery vs other), type of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics used before randomisation\n5 pre-specified subgroups: Pulmonary infection, \u03b2-lactam antibiotic, Age (< or > 65), Sex, APACHE II score (< or > 25)\nClinical cure defined as completion of \u03b2-lactam antibiotic by day 14 without recommencement of antibiotics within 48hrs of cessation for same infective episode (investigator assessment of clinical response)\nIndependent DSMB conducted pre-specified midpoint safety analysis\n\nSetting\n\n104 intensive care units in 7 countries:\n\nAustralia (25) / New Zealand (6) / UK (55) / Belgium (8) / France (5) / Sweden (3) / Malaysia (2)\n\n\nRecruitment from March 2018 \u2013 January 2023\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\nAdults in ICU with\n\nDocumented site/strong suspicion of infection\n\u22651 organ dysfunction criteria met in previous 24hrs\nTreatment with piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem commenced within prior 24hrs\nExpected to remain in ICU for at least the next calendar day\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nReceipt of piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem for more than 24hrs during current infectious episode\nPatient known or suspected to be pregnant\nKnown allergy to piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem or penicillin\nRequiring renal replacement therapy (acute or chronic)\nPreviously enrolled in BLING III\nPalliative treatment only, limits to care, death is imminent, or death is likely within 90 days due to underlying process\n\n\n29042 patients screened \u2192 7202 randomised\n\n3595 to receive continuous antibiotics\n3607 to receive intermittent antibiotics\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of continuous vs. intermittent group\n\nAge: 59.3 vs 59.6 years\nMale: 66 vs 65 %\nAPACHE II: 19.6 vs 19.5\nInotropes/vasopressors in 24hr prior to randomisation: 71 vs 70 %\nReceived antibiotics in 24hr prior to randomisation: 67 vs 70 %\nSource of admission:\n\nED: 34 vs 33 %\nWards: 28 vs 30 %\nOT post emergency surgery: 21 vs 20 %\n\n\nPrimary site of infection:\n\nPulmonary 59 vs 60 %\nIntra-abdominal 13 vs 13 %\nBlood 8 vs 8 %\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nContinuous infusion of \u03b2-lactam antibiotic (for clinician prescribed duration OR until ICU discharge)\nInfusion over 24 hours began with a bolus of intermittent dose as a load\n\nDuration: median 5.8 days\nCumulative Dose: median 72 g (40.5 \u2013 108) of Piperacillin-Tazobactam, and 17g (9 \u2013 29) of meropenem\n\n\n\nControl\n\nIntermittent infusion of \u03b2-lactam antibiotic\nInfusion over 30mins\n\nDuration: median 5.7 days\nCumulative Dose: median 70.8 g (40.5 \u2013 103.5) of Piperacillin-Tazobactam, and 16.0g (8.0 \u2013 28.0) of meropenem\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nDose of antibiotic determined by clinician\n\nDefined daily dose was 14g for Piperacillin-Tazobactam and 3g for Meropenem\nDose could be modified in response to patient changes\n\n\nSwitch between either was permitted as long as remained in same treatment group\nReversion to intermittent dosing after 14 days or ICU discharge\nAll other management at discretion of treating clinician\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome\n\nNo significant difference in

mechanical ventilation or RRT by day 90\n\n\nSubgroups:\n\nAll point estimates favoured continuous infusion but none statistically significant\n\n\nAdverse Events:\n\n0.3% in continuous group vs 0.2% in intermittent group\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe observed difference in 90-day mortality between continuous vs intermittent infusions of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics did not meet statistical significance in the primary analysis. However, the confidence interval around the effect estimate includes the possibility of both no important effect and a clinically important benefit in the use of continuous infusions in this group of patients\n\nStrengths\n\nExtremely large RCT with robust internal and external validity\n\nDetailed screening log with a majority of those screened but not enrolled meeting exclusion criteria or declining to take part\nLarge number of centres across multiple countries\nBalanced baseline characteristics \u2013 similar organisms cultured, baseline antibiotic use\nDoses and duration of antibiotics similar between groups (eTable 7, eFigure 1 and eFigure 2)\n\n\nDetailed collection of infection site and antimicrobial data (eTable 3 \u2013 6, 9)\nMinimal loss to follow up\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnblinded\nDosing reverted to intermittent pre and post ICU \u2013 this may bias results towards the null\nNo consensus as to definition of clinical cure:\n\nWhilst the definition used in this trial is pragmatic and objective, is 48 hours long enough following cessation of antimicrobials to say clinical cure has been achieved?\n\n\nPotential that patients with non-infectious causes of organ dysfunction are included\nNo reporting on therapeutic dose monitoring, or sensitivities / susceptibilities\nApproximately 1/3rd of patients had a protocol violation (eTable 12):\n\n34% (continuous) vs 32% (intermittent) of patients\nA large proportion were related to administration or dosing, of which the largest contributor was a pause or delay for > 1 hour:\n\n15.3% (continuous) and 22.6% (intermittent)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn adult ICU patients with sepsis, continuous infusions should be commenced if IV access is available, given potential for benefit alongside no evidence for harm\nI will be interested to see the results of any economic analyses or work into the impact of continuous infusions on bedside workload\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Continuous vs Intermittent \u03b2-Lactam Antibiotic Infusions in Critically Ill Patients With Sepsis: The BLING III Randomized Clinical Trial\nfurther reading Resolving the Dilemma on Continuous vs Intermittent \u03b2-Lactam Antibiotics in Sepsis \u2013 JAMA editorial\nfurther reading Prolonged vs Intermittent Infusions of \u03b2-Lactam Antibiotics in Adults With Sepsis or Septic Shock \u2013 A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis \n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Audrey Guo\nSummary date: July 20th 2024\nPeer-review editor: George Walker\nPicture by: Jordan Rushton / Pexels\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
