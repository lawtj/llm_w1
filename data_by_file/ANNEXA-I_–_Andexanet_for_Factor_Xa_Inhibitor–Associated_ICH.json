DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2313040\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients who have recently taken factor Xa inhibitors with an intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) did the administration of Andexanet result in better haemostatic efficacy compared to standard care?\n\nBackground\n\nFactor Xa inhibitors (such as apixaban or rivaroxaban) are widely used however ICH is a possible consequence of their use\nIt is hypothesised that rapid reversal\u00a0with Andexanet, a novel antidote to the effect of FXA inhibitors, in the case of ICH, may reduce risk of haematoma expansion and thus improve outcomes\nConventionally,\u00a0prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is used to reverse any effect of FXA inhibitors, as there are no specific antidotes such as Idarucizumab, which can be used for dabigatran reversal\nANNEXA 4\u00a0was a single arm study in patients with acute major bleeding, associated with factor Xa inhibitors, that andexanet markedly reduced anti\u2013factor Xa activity, and 82% of patients had excellent or good hemostatic efficacy\n\nDesign\n\nInternational, multi-centre RCT\nUnblinded, but the end points were adjudicated by a committee whose members were unaware of the patients\u2019 group assignments\nAllocated in 1:1 ratio\n\nRandomisation stratified by intention to use PCC and according to the time from onset of symptoms to baseline imaging (< or > 180 minutes)\n\n\nPower calculation based on ANNEXA 4 study with 80% achieving haemostatic efficacy\n\n900 patients would have 90% power to show an absolute difference of 10%\u00a0improvement in haemostatic efficacy\n\n\nPre-specified rules for stopping: trial stopped at interim analysis of 452 patients for efficacy\nPrimary outcome of haemostatic efficacy achieved if all the following criteria were met:\n\na change in the hematoma volume of 20% or less (excellent hemostatic efficacy) or 35% or less (good hemostatic efficacy) within 12 hours after baseline\nan increase in the NIHSS score of less than 7 points at 12 hours\nno receipt of rescue therapies such as andexanet, prothrombin complex concentrate, or surgery to decompress the hematoma within 3 to 12 hours after randomization\n\n\nThe between-group difference, P value, and 95% CI were calculated with the use of a Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel test stratified according to the time from symptom onset to the performance of the baseline imaging scan (<180 or \u2265180 minutes)\nWritten obtained consent from patient or proxy allowed to be deferred in certain situations\n\nSetting\n\nJune 2019 \u2013 May 2023\n131 sites in 23 countries\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nTaken a FXA inhibitor within 15 hours\nICH\nWithin 12 hours of symptoms to baseline imaging scan\nRandomisation within 2 hours of baseline imaging scan\nProtocol was amended and inclusion criteria tightened:\n\nOnly patients with ICH (not subdural or subarachnoid) with an estimated volume of 0.5 \u2013 60ml and a maximum score on the NIHSS of 35\n6 hours from symptoms to scan\n\n\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nGCS < 7\nNIHSS > 35\nSurgery within 12 hours of enrollment\nRecent thrombotic event (within 2 weeks)\n\n\n550 patients randomised\n\nUnable to confirm emergency or deferred consent in 20 patients so data deleted\n530 included\n\n263 to andexanet\n267 usual care\n\nOnly 452 of those that had been enrolled up\u00a0until the interim analysis were included in the primary efficacy analysis, the additional 78 enrolled post interim analysis were only included in\u00a0the safety analyses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaseline Characteristics: Intervention vs. Control Group\n\nRelatively balanced but some differences in location of haemorrhage\nComparing Andexanet vs Usual Care\n\nAge: 79 vs 79\nFemale: 42 vs 50%\nCr Clearance < 30 ml/min: 5 vs 4%\nXa inhibitor used:\n\nApixaban: 63 vs 60%\nRivaroxaban: 29 vs 29%\n\n\nIntracerebral hemorrhage: 88 vs 94% (those included before the protocol amendment could be included if SDH/SAH present)\nPreceded by trauma: 12 vs 15%\nAF: 90.2 vs 84.2%\nSBP: 161 vs 160 mmHg\nMedian haematoma volume: 11 vs 9 ml\nMedian GCS: 15 vs 15\nMedian time from symptoms to scan: 2.3 vs 2.4 hours\nMedian time from presentation to receipt: 2.1 vs 2.4 hours\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nAndexanet\n\nGiven at either high or low dose depending on dose of Xa inhibitor and time between last dose and initiation of Andexanet (Table S1)\nBolus over 15-30 minutes followed by infusion over 2 hours\n58 patients received high dose and 200 patients received low dose\n\n\n\nControl\n\nUsual care\n\nDetermined by local physicians and could include PCC\n230 received PCC (85.5%)\nOf those receiving PCC: 4 factor PCC was given in 92.4%, 3-factor PCC in 3.4%, and PCC or F-VIII bypass inhibitor in 4.2%\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nComparing andexanet vs usual care groups\nHaemostatic Efficacy: 67 vs 53 %\n\nAdjusted difference 13.4% (95% CI 4.6 \u2013 22.2, p = 0.003)\nThis remained significant in extended population (i.e. including all 530 patients, Table S4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-hoc analysis\n\nmRS of 0 to 3 at 30 days\n69/246 (28.0%) in andexanet group vs 79/255 (31.0%) in usual care group\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\n\n\nIn a trial involving patients with ICH who had taken a factor Xa inhibitor within the previous 15 hours, andexanet rapidly reduced anti\u2013factor Xa activity and resulted in better control of hematoma expansion on a composite measure than usual care but was associated with thrombotic events\n\n\n\n\nStrengths\n\nInternational RCT\nLargely balanced baseline characteristics\nMinimal loss to follow up\nMinimal cross over\n\n9 patients either did or did not get andexanet\n\n\nRobust safety analysis\nMeasurement of anti-FXa activity enhances biological plausibility of results (Table S6)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnblinded, although end points were adjudicated by a committee\u00a0who were unaware of the patient\u2019s group assignment\nThe trial was not powered to detect mortality difference or functional outcome differences\nAlthough primary outcome did include some patient important components, these were all early (12 hours) and the only assessment of whether these translated to more meaningful longer-term outcomes was a post-hoc analysis\nAdditionally, primary outcome largely driven by haematoma volume change \u2013 this may or may not be clinically important given small baseline volumes\n\nAuthors note that in INTERACT trial each 1 ml of growth was associated with 5% higher chance of death or dependency at 90 days\n\n\nTrial was sponsored and funded by Portola (who provided drug free of charge) and two employees were involved in trial design\nLarge numbers of protocol amendments including changes to eligibility criteria and primary and secondary endpoints\nUncertain how this trial would apply to those with more severe ICH (lower GCS +/- larger haematomas) as excluded those with GCS < 7 and baseline haematoma volume ~10mls and GCS 15.\nLikewise, treatment administered rapidly so can\u2019t be applied to patients who may have a longer duration to receive treatment such as those in more rural areas\nNo documentation (apart from PCC administration) as to what usual care consisted of\nAn economic analysis would be important given increased cost of andexanet compared to PCC\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial demonstrates a reduction in ICH haematoma expansion; however, it provides no evidence of long-term benefits that are patient important. There is, however, evidence of harm, with increased rates of thrombotic events and ischemic strokes\nAs such I do not think this trial provides enough evidence for me to use andexanet\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Andexanet for Factor Xa Inhibitor\u2013Associated Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker @hgmwalker89\nSummary date: 9th July 2024\nPeer-review editor: Celia Bradford\nPicture by: Amel Uzunovic / Pexels\n\n\n"
