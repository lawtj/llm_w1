NEJM 1012;367(26):2471-2481. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1207363\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with severe traumatic brain injury does monitoring intracranial pressure improve mortality and improve neurological function?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nComputer generated randomisation\nRandomisation stratified according to study site, severity of injury and age\nParallel-group\nBlinding of examiners assessing neuro-functional outcome\nSample size calculation\n\n324 patients would give 80% power to detect an increase of 10% of patients with a good outcome or moderate disability according to the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E)\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n6 sites in Bolivia and Ecuador\n\nAll had ICUs staffed with intensivists, 24 hour CT and neurosurgery coverage\n\n\nSeptember 2008 \u2013 October 2011\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAge \u226513\nOn admission or within 48 hours of injury: GCS 3-8 (with a score on the motor component of 1-5 if the patient was intubated)\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nGCS 3 and bilateral fixed and dilated pupils\nInjury thought to be unsurvivable\n\n\n\n\nConcerning intervention and control groups\n\nMedian time to arrival at 1st hospital was 1.0hr for direct admissions and 2.7hrs for transfers\nAge (median) 29 vs. 29\nTransferred from another hospital 62% vs. 61%\nMarshall classification on initial CT head: Diffuse injury III/IV: 51% vs. 48%\nEvacuated mass lesion 31% vs. 35%\n\n\n324 patients randomised\n\nIntervention\n\nIntracranial pressure monitoring\n\nIntra-parenchymal monitor placed as soon as possible\nTreated to maintain ICP <20mmHg according to standard guidelines\nMonitored for median 3.6 days\n\n\n\nControl\n\nTreatment based on clinical finding and CT scan results\n\nClinical/imaging signs of intracranial hypertension treated first with protocol specific doses of hyperosmolar therapy, optional mild hyperventilation + optional ventricular drainage\nIf continuing oedema, guideline based care with consideration of rescue treatments e.g. high dose barbiturates, decompressive craniectomy\n\n\n\n\nIn both intervention and control groups\n\n\n\nCT scans obtained at baseline, 48 hours and 5-7 days\nSupportive care given to include mechanical ventilation, sedation + analgesia\n\nComparing intervention vs. control groups\n\n\n\nSignificantly more patients in control group vs. intervention group treated with:\n\nHypertonic saline 72% vs. 58%, P=0.008\nHyperventilation 73% vs 60%, P=0.003\n\n\nSignificantly more patients in intervention vs. control group treated with:\n\nBarbiturates 24% vs. 13%, P=0.02\n\n\nComparing intervention vs. control group no significant difference in rate of treatment with:\n\nMannitol 51%vs. 57%, P=0.25\nCSF Drainage 1% vs. 2%, P=0.37\nCraniotomy for mass lesion 40% vs. 45%, P=0.5\nCraniectomy 28% vs. 30%, P=0.81\n\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Composite of 21 components including survival time, duration of impaired consciousness and neuropsychological status, at 6 months \u2013 no significant difference\n\nComparing intervention to control groups\n\nMedian 56 vs. 53, p=0.49, (Proportional Odds Ratio 1.09, 95% C. I. 0.74-1.58)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: comparing intervention to control groups\n\nNo significant difference in mortality or GOS-E Scale\n\n14 day mortality: 21% vs. 30% (Hazard ratio 1.36, 95% C.I. 0.87-2.11, P=0.18)\n6 month mortality 39% vs. 40% (Hazard ratio 1.1, 95% C.I. 0.77-1.57, P=0.6)\nFavourable outcome on GOS-E Scale at 6 months 44% vs. 39%\n\n\nSignificant increase in Decubitus ulcers in ICP monitoring group\n\n12% vs. 5%, P=0.03\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nManagement guided by ICP monitoring is not superior to management guided by neurological examination and serial CT imaging in patients with severe traumatic brain injury\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised\nMulti-centre\nBlinding of assessors of primary outcome\n\nWeaknesses\n\nComposite primary outcome with mortality equally weighted with 20 other variables such as motor dexterity\nNot powered for mortality\nDifferences in treatment strategies between intervention and control groups e.g. in intervention group drainage of CSF was 1st option for raised ICP, where as this was not an option in control group\nStudy performed in Bolivia and Ecuador. There are significant differences between the health care provided, particularly pre-hospital resuscitation, between Bolivia/Ecuador and Western European countries. Therefore these results may not be valid in other settings.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with severe traumatic brain injury, care guided by ICP monitoring did not improve outcomes compared with management based on clinical and examination findings. Therefore I would not recommend the introduction of ICP monitoring in a resource limited setting. However, in countries such as the UK where ICP monitoring is already standard practice, I would not change practice based on this study as no harm was found, and there are significant differences in the health care provided between the UK and Bolivia/Ecuador.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0A trial of intracranial-pressure monitoring in traumatic brain injury\n[open access pdf of article]\u00a0A Trial of Intracranial-Pressure Monitoring in Traumatic Brain Injury\n[Further reading]\u00a0LITFL Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Monitoring\n[Further reading]\u00a0Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date: 25th May 2015\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n"
