Critical Care Medicine 2012;40(8):2342-2348\nClinical Question\n\nDoes early nasojejunal feeding improve the delivery of enteral nutrition in comparison to nasogastric nutrition in critically ill patients experiencing poor gastric motility?\n\nDesign\n\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nStratified by site and presence of vasopressor infusion\nBlock randomisation\nNon-blinded\n\n\nSetting\n\n\n17 medical/surgical ICUs in Australia\n\n\nParticipants\n\n\nInclusion: Adults patients who were mechanically ventilated and admitted to ICU in last 72hrs, receiving narcotic infusion and had elevated gastric volumes (single measurement >150ml or >500ml in 12hrs)\nExcluded if contraindication to nasojejunal feeding\n181 patients enrolled from 3623 patients screened\n\n\nIntervention\n\n\nNasojejunal nutrition through Tiger tube (successful small bowel placement in 87%)\n\n\nControl\n\n\nNasogastric nutrition\n\nPatients in both the intervention and control group had energy requirements set by standard protocol. Patients with clinical manifestations of enteral nutrition intolerance received metoclopramide followed by erythromycin\n\nOutcome\n\n\nPrimary outcome: proportion of energy requirements delivered from enteral nutrition during ICU stay (up to 28 days)\n\n71% in NG vs. 72% in NJ, \u00a0Mean difference 1%, 95% C.I. -3% to 5%,\u00a0P=0.66.\n\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nMinor haemorrhage more common in NJ (13%) vs. NG (3%), P=0.02\nNo difference in major haemorrhage (2% vs. 2%, P=0.98), or ventilator acquired pneumonia (20% vs. 21%, P=0.94)\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\nIn ICU patients with mildly elevated gastric volumes, early nasojejunal nutrition did not increase energy delivery in comparison to nasogastric nutrition\n\n\nStrengths\n\n\nAppropriate power calculation\nMulti-centre\nEnsured allocation concealment through use of central randomisation\nBlinding of assessors of diagnosis of ventilator acquired pneumonia\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\n\nNon-blinded\n235 patients not randomised as study staff not available\n9% of NG group crossed over to use NJ\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with mildly elevated gastric volumes, who are receiving ~70% of their target nutrition via a nasogastric tube, there is no advantage, and there may be harm from introducing nasojejunal feeding\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf\u00a0/\u00a0abstract\u00a0/\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\n\nNone\n\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 12 May 2014\nPeer-review editor: @stevemathieu75\n\n\n\n"
