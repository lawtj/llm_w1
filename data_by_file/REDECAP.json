N Engl J Med 2020; 383:1009-17. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2010834]\nClinical Question\n\nIn conscious critically ill patients who have had a tracheostomy inserted as part of their ICU stay and have been weaned from mechanical ventilation, does an assessment of readiness for decannulation that is based on suctioning frequency, when compared to an assessment based on tracheostomy capping, result in a shorter time to successful decannulation?\n\nBackground\n\nApproximately 15% of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation receive a tracheostomy as part of their care\nEvidence for decannulation readiness is limited to expert opinion, survey studies, single-centre experience, unvalidated prediction scores, and randomised trials that have assessed organisational aspects e.g. intensivist-led tracheostomy teams\nCapping trials are commonly used to determine readiness for decannulation. Protocol-based capping trials have led to readiness criteria with a high specificity and positive predictive value for successful decannulation, however this is thought to occur at the cost of delaying decannulation\nAn alternative approach to assess readiness for decannulation is to measure the number of times that secretions are suctioned from a patient\u2019s airway over a given period of time, with fewer episodes of suctioning considered to be a positive indicator of potentially successful decannulation\n\nDesign\n\nMulticentre randomised controlled trial\nRandomisation via random number generator, occurring within 8 hours of weaning from mechanical ventilation\nOpen label study \u2013 treating clinician and patients not blinded\nSample size\n\nCalculated to detect a 3-day difference in the time to decannulation; assuming a mean (+/-SD) time of 13+/-11 days in the control group\nA sample of 165 patients per group was considered adequate for the trial to have 80% power, with an alpha level of 5% for two-sided tests and with no more than 15% dropout\n\n\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nKaplan-Meier curves were used to assess time to decannulation and compared using log-rank test\nConfidence intervals from time-to-event outcomes were calculated with the use of inference for linear function of medians, and the Newcombe and Wilson hybrid score was used to calculate the interval estimation for the difference between proportions\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\n\nSetting\n\n5 intensive care units in Spain\nRecruitment occurred between May 2016 and May 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Critically ill patients who had a tracheostomy that was created during an intensive care stay and had been successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation (defined as freedom from mechanical ventilation for 24 consecutive hours)\nExclusion:\n\nContraindication to decannulation at time of randomisation (unconsciousness, severe swallowing dysfunction, an airway patency problem, neuromuscular disease other than ICU-acquired weakness or tracheostomy for airway control)\nAge < 18 years\nExpectation (according to the Sabadell score, which is a measure of risk of death) that death would occur before hospital discharge\n\n\n330 patients were enrolled, out of 799 patients assessed for eligibility\nAll patients were followed until hospital discharge or death\nBaseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups, control vs. intervention\n\nAge: 59.3 vs 57.3 yrs\nMale: 67.1% vs 69.2%\nAPACHE II score: 10.8 vs 11.6\nMedian duration of mechanical ventilation before tracheostomy: 13 vs 13 days\nIndication for tracheostomy\n\nMechanical ventilation for >21 days: 18.6% vs. 17.2%\nProlonged weaning from mechanical ventilation: 39.8% vs. 47.3%\nLow level of consciousness: 26.7% vs. 21.9%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nContinuous high flow oxygen and decannulation based on assessment of suctioning frequency (n=169)\n\nPatients underwent decannulation if they received suctioning for pre-specified indications <2 times every 8 hours for a 24-hour period\n\n\n\nControl\n\nIntermittent high flow oxygen therapy and decannulation based on capping trial (n=161)\n\nPatients underwent decannulation following a capping trial, in which a cap was placed on the tracheostomy tube for 24 hours\n\nPatients were considered to be ready to undergo a capping trial when they had had no more than 1 suction every 4 hours during a 12-hour period according to pre-specified indications\nFailure of the capping trial was defined as decapping for any reason during the 24-hour period. When a capping trial failed, a new capping trial was not allowed until the following day\nPatients who repeatedly failed capping trials could undergo decannulation outside the protocol on the basis of suctioning requirements if the attending physicians considered them to be ready\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\n7mm inner-diameter tracheostomy tube with a fenestrated inner sleeve (TRACHOE twist or medical) was used\n\nUnless BMI >45 or anatomical concerns\n\n\nPatients were weaned from mechanical ventilation according to the following protocol:\n\nDaily screening\nDrink test:\n\nAssessment of aspiration risk: patient swallowed 50mL of water with the cuff deflated\n\n\nOcclusion test:\n\nAssessment to rule out tracheal airflow obstruction: tracheostomy tube opening occluded (with the tracheal cuff deflated) for 5 minutes\n\n\nSpontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT):\n\nProgressive weaning from mechanical ventilation based on intermittent trials of spontaneous breathing of progressively longer duration through the tracheostomy tube\nBetween trials at least 2 hours of assist-control ventilation\nSBTs were attempted twice a day\nIf no signs of respiratory distress, the trial was continued for 12 hours\nWhen patients were able to sustain spontaneous breathing for >12 hours on 2 consecutive days, they switched to continuous high-flow oxygen therapy through their tracheostomy tube\n\n\nAll patients received high-flow oxygen therapy once weaned from mechanical ventilation.\n\nAirvo 2 (Fisher and Paykel Healthcare) with a specific interface for tracheostomy tubes\nFlow of 60L/min, temperature 37oC, and FiO2 was adjusted to maintain SpO2 92 to 95%\n\n\nPre-specified criteria for performing suctioning\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Median time to tracheostomy decannulation \u2013 significantly greater in the control vs. the intervention group\n\nDefined as time from the completion of weaning from MV (24 consecutive hours disconnected from the ventilator) to actual decannulation\nControl 13 days (IQR 12 to 14) vs. Intervention 6 days (IQR 5 to 7); absolute difference 7 days (95% CI 5 to 9)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: (comparing control vs. intervention groups)\n\nRegardless of the method used, 95% of all enrolled patients underwent decannulation successfully, and there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of recannulation\n\n5.6%\u00a0 vs. 2.4%, Difference 3.2% (95% C.I. -1.2 to 8.1)\n\n\nInfection \u2013 increased in control group\n\nPneumonia\n\n9.9% vs. 4.1%\nDifference 5.8% (95% C.I. 0.2 to 11.8)\n\n\nTracheobronchitis\n\n29.9% vs. 18.9%\nDifference 10.3% (95% C.I. 1.0 to 19.3)\n\n\n\n\nLength of stay (median)\n\nIn the ICU \u2013 no difference\n\n35 vs. 32 days\nDifference 3 days (95% C.I. -1 to 11)\n\n\nIn the hospital \u2013 increased in control group\n\n62 vs. 48 days\nDifference 14 days (95% C.I. 9-33)\n\n\n\n\nICU mortality\n\n0% vs. 0%\n\n\n\n\nPost-hoc analysis\n\nWeaning failure (defined as re-initiation of mechanical ventilation within 7 days) \u2013 greater in control group\n\n16.8% vs. 6.5%, (Difference 10.3%, 95% C.I. 3.4 to 17.4)\n\n\nIn the control group\n\n73% of patients had at least 1 failure on the capping trial; the majority (81%) of these were to remove accumulated pulmonary secretions\n7% patients had repeated failures on capping trials, however successfully underwent decannulation out of protocol\n\n\nDecannulation before ICU discharge \u2013 reduced in control group\n\n64.6% vs. 82.2%\nDifference -17.7% (95% C.I. -26.8 to -8.1%)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn conscious, critically ill adult patients with a tracheostomy tube, time to decannulation was shorter in those with decannulation based on suctioning frequency plus the use of continuous high-flow oxygen therapy than in those who received the standard of care with capping trials plus the use of intermittent high-flow oxygen therapy, with no significant difference in the incidence of recannulation\nThe reasoning for this is hypothesized to be that capping trials require patients to overcome an excessively demanding ventilatory workload\n\nStrengths\n\nMulticentre, randomised control trial\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nImportant question with relevant patient-centred outcomes\nProtocolised approach to weaning\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnblinded to clinicians and patients; unclear if blinded to investigators\nProtocol had a relatively conservative approach to:\n\nweaning from mechanical ventilation\nthe initiation of capping trials\nlength of time required to be achieved for capping trials (24 hours)\n\n\nThe use of high-flow oxygen therapy is a confounder\n\nThe intervention group received continuous high-flow and the control group received intermittent high-flow oxygen therapy (when not undergoing capping)\n\n\nIndustry supported\n\nFisher and Paykel Healthcare paid for writing assistance with the manuscript, and travel support for two authors\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis was really a trial of decannulation based on suction frequency with continuous high-flow oxygen therapy versus decannulation based on conservative capping with intermittent high-flow oxygen therapy\nMany aspects of this trial differ from my usual practice, including tracheostomy selection, the method of weaning from mechanical ventilation, and the routine use of high-flow oxygen therapy\nHowever, overall, this trial supports what has already been assumed by many, that in conscious patients with no concerns about upper airway patency, 24 hour capping trials are an unnecessary burden\nWe should avoid routine tracheostomy capping and instead base a decannulation readiness assessment on suction frequency, armed with the knowledge that this should result in a shorter time to decannulation without an increased risk of tracheostomy reinsertion or patient harm\n\nExternal Links\n\nN Engl J Med High-Flow Oxygen with Capping or Suctioning for Tracheostomy Decannulation\nN Engl J Med Editorial Building an Evidence Base for Survivors of Critical Illness\nFurther reading Ward mortality after ICU discharge: a multicenter validation of the Sabadell score\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Kate Triplett @TriplettKate\nSummary date: 16/09/2020\nPeer-review editor: Luke Collett @luke_col\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
