(37.9% vs 23.7% p=0.096)\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\nImmediate implementation of VA-ECMO in patients with rapidly deteriorating or severe cardiogenic shock (corresponding to SCAI stage D-E) was feasible but did not improve clinical outcomes compared with an early conservative approach permitting downstream use of VA-ECMO in cases of hemodynamic worsening\nStrengths\n\nRare to successfully complete a randomised trial of VA-ECMO\nWeb-based randomisation\nPragmatic design\nMulti-centre study performed in the emergency setting\nMinimal loss to follow up\nSimilar baseline characteristics between groups\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPatients on high levels of haemodynamic support at time of randomisation so arguably this would not consititute \u2018early\u2019 VA ECMO\nComposite outcome makes finding harder to interpret particularly as additional mechanical support included- especially relevant as use of further mechanical support was significantly reduced in the ECMO group without changing the overall composite outcome\nGoals of ECMO initiation not clearly defined- separating out who was being \u201cbridged to recovery\u201d vs \u201cbridge to therapy\u201d or \u201cbridge to decision\u201d would help separate out potential responses\nHigh levels of crossover (39% of patients in early conservative arm received VA ECMO); this would dilute any potential effect of the intervention\nNo independent adjudication of primary end point\nVery large predicted effect size increases risk of type 2 error\nRelatively long recruitment periods inceases possibity of changes in treatment over time\nVenting strategy was not standardised; this could be important as a recent study demonstrated that the combination of IABP (a common venting device) and ECMO was associated with improved outcomes over ECMO alone\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCurrently I would not routinely place patients on to VA ECMO early in the face of rapidly deteriorating cardiogenic shock without initially trying conservative measures\nI would however have a low threshold to transition to rescue ECMO if there was no improvement and with a defined treatment direction (bridge to recovery, decision, or destination such as transplant)\nThe role of VA ECMO in patients in earlier cardiogenic shock (before they have started to develop the cardio metabolic syndrome) remains of interest, especially if the trajectory can be predicted- further studies will help define this\n\nExternal Links \n\nArticle\u2013 Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in the Therapy of Cardiogenic Shock: Results of the ECMO-CS Randomized Clinical Trial\nFurther reading: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for cardiogenic shock: A meta analysis of mortality and complications\nFurther watching:\u00a0 Radcliffe & CardioNerds @AHA22: The ECMO-CS Trial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Alastair Brown\nSummary date: 29th December 2022\nPeer-review editor: Segun Olusanya\nPicture by: Wavelength by Luan Rezende (Courtesy of PEXELS)\n\n\n"
