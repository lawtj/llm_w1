Lancet Resp Med\u00a02016; 4(3): 194-202.\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult ICU patients, does the use dynamic light therapy compared\u00a0to normal\u00a0lighting, reduce the incidence and duration of ICU-acquired delirium?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nConsecutive recruitment\nSingle-centre\nUnblinded\nIntention to treat analysis\nPower calculation: 1000 patients needed to detect 10% absolute reduction in delirium incidence (90% power, 2-sided alpha value of 0.05).\n\nAssumed incidence rate of delirium of 40% in control group\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nDutch teaching hospital\n16 bed mixed medical and surgical ICU; 12 of which had direct daylight access\nData collected: July 2011 \u2013 September 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n\u226518 years old\nExpected ICU stay > 24 hours\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nLife expectancy < 48 hours\nUnable to assess for delirium (severe sensory impairment; severe mental impairment; unable to understand Dutch language)\n\n\nParticipant numbers\n\n1374 eligible, 734 randomised (361 Intervention, 373 control), data available for 711\n400 excluded as expected LOS < 24h\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics (intervention vs control):\n\nAge: 66.3 vs 64.4\nMen: 58% vs 59%\nAPACHE II: 22.7 vs 22.4\nMedical patients: 73% vs 65%\nHistory of cognitive disturbance or alcohol abuse: 17% vs 14%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nDynamic lighting level and colour temperature sequence:\n\nRose from 0700h onwards to peaks of 1700 lux (illuminance) and 4300K (colour temperature) at 0900h\nMaintained until 1130h\nDecreased to 300 lux and 3000K until 1330h\nIncreased to 1700 lux and 4300K until 1600\nGradual reduction to\u00a0300 lux over 1h at 1600\nLight turned off automatically at 2230h\n\n\nIf emergency lighting required, 1000 lux light could be used which would automatically revert to previous setting after 30 minutes\n\nControl\n\nStandard lighting setting of 300 lux and 3000K. The light could be turned off and on in the room and could be changed to bright settings of 1000 lux for emergencies and procedures\n\nFor both intervention and control group\n\nIdentical lighting system (Philips Dynalite DUS804C, Philips Lighting) was installed in every ICU room\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\u00a0Cumulative incidence of ICU-acquired delirium (comparing intervention and control)\n\nNo significant difference (38% vs 33%, Odds ratio 1.24, 95% CI 0/92-1.68, p=0.16)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: comparing intervention\u00a0vs. control group\n\nNo statistically significant difference in any of the outcome measures\n\nDelirium free days: 26 vs 27 (P=0.29)\nDuration of mechanical ventilation: 20h vs 19hr (P=0.67)\nLength of ICU stay: 4 days vs 4 days (P=0.82)\nICU mortality: 12% vs 14% (P=0.42)\nLength of hospital stay: 15 days vs 16 days (P=0.84)\n\n\nNo significant difference on further analysis in:\n\nUse of sedative agents\nUse of haloperidol\nHospital mortality\nExcretion profile of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin or cortisol (biochemical markers of circadian rhythm)\n\n\n\n\nMean cumulative daytime lighting levels between 0600h and 1800h were significantly higher in the intervention group compared with the control group: 5366 vs 2793 lux (P<0.0001). Outside this period, mean lux was similar in both groups\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn critically ill patients\u00a0the use of continuous lighting therapy was not effective in reducing the cumulative incidence or the duration of ICU-acquired delirium compared to normal lighting.\n\nStrengths\n\nRCT\nSeparation of intervention and control light profile achieved\nCAM-ICU score is recognised and validated for use of assessing delirium. This was measured three times each day\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle centre\nMain exclusion criteria was that the patient was expected to spend < 24h on ICU. Duration of invasive mechanical ventilation in both groups 19-20h which is short\nIncidence of delirium in control group lower than that used for power calculations\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDynamic light therapy at supranormal levels conferred no benefit above natural lighting. Delirium on the ICU remains common and difficult to treat. I will continue my usual practice of daily sedation breaks, early mobilisation and orientation therapy on the ICU\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Dynamic light application therapy to reduce the incidence and duration of delirium in intensive-care patients: a randomised controlled trial\n[FOAMed]\u00a0Sleep and ICU\n[FOAMed]\u00a0http://ICUdelirium.co.uk\n[further reading]\u00a0\u2018In a dark place, we find ourselves\u2019: light intensity in critical care units\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@avkwong\nSummary date: 6th February 2017\nPeer-review editor: @stevemathieu75\n\n\n"
