95% CI\u00a01.3% to 23.5%; P=0.03)\n\nThis remained statistically significant in the modified Intention to Treat (mITT) analysis, with the 32 patients re-intubated for surgery removed (representing 11% of patients)\n\n\nNumber needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one re-intubation: 9 patients\nFragility Index: 2\n\n\nSecondary outcome: see table for data\n\nRe-intubation rate within 30 days was not different\nIncidence of pneumonia and health-care associated infections was lower in the NIV group\nDays alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation were greater in the NIV group\nThe 30-day mortality ARR point estimate was 5.04%, which gives an NNT of 20 patients, but this was not statistically significant and the 95% confidence intervals of the ARR include -2.5% to 12.8% (slightly harmful to very beneficial)\nThere was no difference in the report of adverse events or intolerance to therapy\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with established hypoxaemic respiratory failure after abdominal surgery, non-invasive ventilation reduces the risk of re-intubation within 7 days compared to standard oxygen therapy.\n\nStrengths\n\nWell designed and conducted trial with clear manuscript\nAppropriate methodology for clinical question\nGood\u00a0internal validity of results however see point about Fragility in weakness section\n\nGood randomisation and allocation strategy to minimise bias\nAppropriate effort to make outcome objective given it is not possible to blind treating clinicians or patients to allocation\nSmall loss-to-follow up relative to primary outcome incidence, and intention-to-treat analysis to minimise bias\nAppropriate statistical methods\n\n\nGood external validity (generalisability)\n\nMulti-centre trial design\nExplicit patient group \u2013 high-risk patients having undergone major-complex abdominal surgery\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nObserved rate of re-intubation was lower than expected, so some secondary outcomes that did not demonstrate statistical significance may be Type 2 errors due to the trial being underpowered (this is not relevant to the primary outcome since significance was demonstrated)\n\nThis is particularly relevant to mortality, which would have been a more meaningful outcome to patients and clinicians\n\n\nDespite attempts to define an objective primary end-point, bias from unblinded clinicians may have contributed to the significant difference favouring NIV\nThe low Fragility Index of 2 highlights how this is not robust evidence \u2013 given 7 patients were lost to follow-up and the potential clinician bias in the primary outcome,\u00a0this is a significant weakness\nGeneralising\u00a0to all\u00a0health-care systems and patients may not be possible as there was a heavy weighting towards laparotomy (91%) vs laparoscopic (11%) surgery (other surgical factors were reasonably well balanced)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn this trial, 6 hours of low-level non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure after major abdominal surgery reduced the need for re-intubation compared to standard oxygen therapy\nAlthough the significant result is relatively fragile, no clinically relevant\u00a0harm or intolerance was identified and therefore this paper will change my practice\nFurther studies comparing this strategy to high-flow nasal oxygen therapy are urgently needed\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of Noninvasive Ventilation on Tracheal Reintubation Among Patients With Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure Following Abdominal Surgery\n[further reading]\u00a0Non-invasive Ventilation by LITFL\n[further reading]\u00a0Interview with NIVAS first author by ESICM\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Duncan Chambler\nSummary date:\u00a018 March 2017\nPeer-review editor: Adrian Wong\n\n\n"
