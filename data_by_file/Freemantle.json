days,\u00a0have an increased 30-day mortality?\n\nDesign\n\nRetrospective cohort study\nData on mortality obtained via Office of National Statistics statutory death reporting\nCox models developed to account for differences in risk of death\n\nCovariates included: age, day of the year (seasonality), previous admissions (complex and emergency), Charlson Comorbidity Index, gender, ethnicity, nature of admission (emergency or elective), source of admission (home or another institution), social deprivation, diagnostic category, hospital trust, day of admission, day of death\n\n\nTwo analyses presented with subgroup\n\nMortality dependant on day of admission\n\nPatients followed up for 30 days after admission\n\n\nMortality dependant on day of in-patients stay\n\nThis is the analysis of what day of the week in-patients died on\nIt does not include the day of admission\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nAll NHS hospitals in England\nApril 2009 \u2013 March 2010\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: all

hospitals demonstrate the same pattern, with statistically significant increased hazard ratio on Saturday, Sunday and Monday for death at 30-days following admission\nOnly Saturday demonstrated a difference between university and non-university affiliated hospitals\n\nUniversity Hospitals: Sat vs. Wed\u2014HR 1.16 (1.12\u20131.20)\nNon-university Hospitals: Sat vs. Wed\u2014HR 1.10 (1.08\u20131.12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nBeing admitted at a weekend is associated with a significantly increased risk of death; but being an in-patient at the weekend is associated with a reduced risk of death\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre including every NHS England trust\nVery large number of patients included\nAppropriate statistical analysis (Cox Regression Model) with attempt at controlling for known covariates\nFollow-up beyond hospital stay to include out-of-hospital deaths, which reduces bias\nSupportive analysis performed to confirm their results\nIncluded analysis of US healthcare centres as comparison\nLow loss to follow up\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe major weakness of this trial is that it shows association only. It cannot demonstrate a causal relationship and therefore any further interpretation is simply hypothesis generating. An important reminder that correlation should not imply causation.\nAbsolute numbers of patients and the proportions within the subgroups (e.g emergency vs. elective) are not provided. This limits how much we can understand the results and how sure we can be about the conclusion.\n\nWhilst some of this data is represented in histograms, the absolute numbers are currently not available [SM: personal communication with Professor Pagano)\n\n\nAlthough the Cox Model has attempted to control for 14 covariates, these are over simplified and there are many others that are intrinsically related to mortality that are not included.\n\nIt is not clear how the researchers adjusted severity of illness in their analysis. The adjustment for severity of illness could also have included other prognostic scores which are associated with mortality such as APACHE or SOFA scores, and whether the patient needed intensive care or organ support. This would allow a more robust comparison of severity of illness between patients admitted on weekdays compared to weekends.\n\n\nThe authors suggest that the reason elective patients who are admitted on a Sunday have higher mortality rates than those admitted during the week, may be due to those patients having high risk operations on the Monday. As the Cox model could not account for these differences it suggests that the model missed a number of important aspects. Therefore, there may also be differences in baseline characteristics between emergency patients who are admitted at the weekend vs. weekday that the model did not account for; and these may be responsible for the differences in mortality found.\n\n\n\nThe time of day that patients were admitted was not recorded. This may be more relevant than what day a patient was admitted as patients who get admitted overnight are likely to be very different to patients admitted during the day. Staffing levels are likely to be the same at 11pm on Wednesday as they are at 11pm on Sunday and therefore any differences in mortality in patients who are admitted overnight on a Sunday vs Wednesday are unlikely to be due to differences in staffing levels. Similarly, it would be useful if there was data comparing early death rate in those admitted on the weekend vs those admitted during the week.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study confirms an association between weekend day admissions and increased mortality within 30-days. However, in-patients are less likely to die on a weekend day than on a week day.\nThe many confounding variables limit the conclusions that can be drawn and it should be considered hypothesis generating only. It is likely that differences in baseline characteristics between patients who are admitted at the weekend vs. weekday, account for at least part of the mortality difference found.\nThere is no evidence presented in this study to firmly support the hypothesis that increasing senior presence and elective weekend work will reduce mortality.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n* This statistic is taken from NHS Choices review (see link below). It is derived from the in-hospital 30-day mortality rate of 1.3%. This is the average mortality across all days of the week. The calculation assumes this 1.3% to be the Wednesday baseline mortality rate (which it likely approximates) and multiplies this by the 1.16 hazard ratio for Sunday admissions. This equals a mortality rate of 1.5%. Per 1000 patients, this equates to 13 deaths on Wednesdays and 15 deaths on Sundays (2 extra per 1000 patients admitted). Without the absolute mortality values, which the paper does not provide, the assumption made in this calculation cannot be cross-checked and the statistic should be used with caution.\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Weekend hospitalization and additional risk of death: an analysis of inpatient data\n[further reading] Sunday hospital admissions \u2018a bigger risk\u2019.
