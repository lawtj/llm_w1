Delay in first antibiotic dose is associated with a linear increase in the risk of mortality for each hour delay in antibiotic administration\nInappropriate antibiotic choice is also associated with an increase in mortality. The mortality increases from 18 to 34% in those who have had inappropriate antibiotic selection\nKnowing the microbiological diagnoses helps clinicians tailor antimicrobial therapy\nThe surviving sepsis campaign recommends taking blood cultures before starting antimicrobial therapies. However, there is a concern that waiting for blood culture collection may delay antimicrobial therapy\n\nDesign\n\nPatient level, single-group diagnostic cohort study\nProspective\nObservational\nBased on previous data, 335 patients were needed assuming that 35% of patients would be bacteremic on initial cultures and that a 10% maximum difference in sensitivity between pre- and postantimicrobial blood cultures would be deemed clinically acceptable. This number was revised to 328 patients based on the repeated measures design of the study. This gave the trial 90% power\n\nSetting\n\nSeven urban emergency departments across Canada and the USA\n330 participants presenting with severe sepsis to the ER between November 2013 and September 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nPatients 18 years of age or greater who presented to the emergency department with evidence of severe manifestations of sepsis\nThis included patients that had two of the four SIRS criteria, a suspected or confirmed infection AND either an initial serum lactate \u22654mmol/L or an initial systolic blood pressure < 90mmHg.\nSIRS criteria includes\n\n(1) temperature >38\u00b0C or <36\u00b0C\n(2) heart rate > 90 beats per minute\n(3) respiratory rate >20 breaths per minute or PaCO2 <32 mm Hg\n(4) white blood cell count >12,000/cu mm, <4,000/cu mm, or >10% immature (band) forms\n\n\nHad 2 tests of blood cultures drawn before starting antibiotic therapy, and who were able to have additional sets drawn within 2 hours of empirical antibiotic administration\n\n\n\n\nExclusion: Patients where excluded if they were known to have a\u00a0 severe coagulopathy, a platelet count below 20 000 x 109 cells/L, or an international normalized ratio above 6.0\n\nPatient characteristics\n\nMean age: 66\nMale: 63%\nLactate >4: 62%\nBP <90: 57%\nSource of infection\n\nRespiratory: 33%\nGenitourinary: 18%\n\n\nInitial antimicrobial regimen\n\nPiperacillin-tazobactem: 34%\nPiperacillin-tazobactem + another antibiotics: 27%\n3rd generation cephalosporin +- another antibiotic: 23.4%\nCarbapenem +- another antibiotic: 4.6%\n\n\nRepeat cultures obtained between:\n\n30-120 minutes from initiation of antimicrobial therapy, n = 264 (per-protocol analysis)\n<30 minutes or >120 minutes from initiation of antimicrobial therapy, n= 61\n\n\n\nGold Standard Test\n\n\n\n\nBlood cultures taken before antimicrobial administration\n\n2 sets of blood cultures were taken before antibiotics.\u00a0 Each set had 1 aerobic and 1 anaerobic bottle. Each set required a separate venepuncture\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest of Interest\n\nBlood cultures taken after antibiotic administration\n\nProtocol stipulated that cultures were to be obtained between 30-120 minutes after treatment initiation\nProtocol amended to include participants with repeated blood cultures up to 240 minutes after treatment initiation\n\nThe results were analysed as per the a priori decision for those participants who had results taken up to 120 minutes after antimicrobial therapy. A further analysis was added to include those patients who had the second lot of cultures taken 120-240 minutes after therapy\n\n\nAt 5 institutions 2 sets of cultures were taken after antibiotics and at 2 institutions 1 set of cultures were taken after antibiotics\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary Outcome\n\nSensitivity of blood cultures obtained within 30-120 minutes after antimicrobial therapy\n\nPer protocol population: 56.3% (95% C.I. 44.7% to 67.3%)\nEntire study population (included patients with cultures obtained from 0-120 minutes): 52.9% (95% C.I. 42.8%-62.9%)\n\n\nRate of positive blood cultures in pre vs. post antimicrobial blood cultures\n\nPer protocol population: 30.3% vs. 19.7%,\u00a0 Absolute difference 10.6% (95% CI 3.3-17.9%)\nEntire study population: 31.4% vs. 19.4%, Absolute difference 12% (95% C.I. 5.4-18.6%)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Outcomes\n\nIf the patient had the first blood culture positive and received an antibiotic that the organism was susceptible to then the post-antimicrobial blood culture was only positive in 51.7% of cases\nIf the patient had the first blood culture positive and received an antibiotic that the organism was NOT susceptible to, then the postantimicrobial culture was positive in 66.7% of cases\nIf blood cultures were positive pre- and post- therapy the cultures became positive a median of 4 hours sooner after collection in the pre-therapy group\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nDrawing blood cultures after antimicrobial therapy in patients with severe sepsis significantly reduces the sensitivity of the blood culture\n\nStrengths\n\nThe trial used best practice when collecting blood culture samples pre-antimicrobial therapy, ie 2 separate sets, from 2 separate venepuncture sites. This reduced the chance of non-pathogenic contaminants\nThe trial results adds weight to the recommendation that all efforts should be made to sample pre-therapy\nThe contamination rate overall was 4.9% which is acceptable\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe trial does not have a comparator control group, so time to antibiotic therapy is not measured and even if it was, there is no control group to determine whether taking blood cultures pre-antibiotics means there\u2019s a delay in giving antibiotic therapy\nOnly a proportion of patients screened were recruited. This limits the generalisability of these results as those that weren\u2019t included may have had some fundamental differences from the study group\nSome variability between sites as to the method of taking the repeat blood cultures\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPositive blood cultures are far more likely to occur if cultures are drawn prior to antibiotic therapy. Logically, this is likely to help tailor antimicrobial therapy and allow de-escalation of treatment when results are obtained\nI will endeavour to take blood cultures in my patients in a timely fashion before antibiotics, providing there is no delay in giving antimicrobials\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Abstract] Blood Culture Results Before and After Antimicrobial Administration in Patients with Severe Manifestation of Sepsis\n[further reading] Surviving Sepsis Guidelines\n[Further listening] David Sweet at Intensive Care Society, State of the Art Conference, 9-11th December 2019\n\n\nhttp://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1430-David-Sweet.mp3\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford (with contribution from Hakeem Ha) @celiabradford\nSummary date: February 10 2020\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@davidslessor\n\n\n"
