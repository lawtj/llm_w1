NEJM 2016 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1515510\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with acute ischaemic stroke, is low-dose thrombolysis therapy with intravenous alteplase non-inferior to standard-dose therapy with respect to death and disability at 90 days?\n\nDesign\n\nOne aspect of Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study (ENCHANTED) which also looks at early intensive lowering of BP\nProspective, randomized\nOpen-label trial with blinded outcome assessors\nNon-inferiority\nFollow up evaluation carried out in person or by telephone by trained and certified staff\nSample size 3300 patients: 90% power for detecting non-inferiority relative margin of 14%, assuming 5% dropout\n\nSetting\n\nInternational, multicentre\n111 centres in 13 countries; Asia, Australia/New Zealand, Europe and South America\nMarch 2012 \u2013 August 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n\u226518 years with a clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke confirmed by brain imaging\nable to receive thrombolysis treatment within 4.5 hours of symptom onset\nwere previously independent, as defined by a prestroke functional ability of 1 or less on the modified Rankin scale (mRS)\nsystolic blood pressure \u2264185 mmHg\npatients with higher BP can still be included provided the BP is reduced to the entry level prior to commencement of alteplase\n\n\nExclusion\n\nunlikely to benefit from the therapy due to pre-existing disability (e.g. advanced dementia) or very high likelihood of death within 24 hours\nanother medical illness that interferes with outcome assessments\nunlikely to adhere to follow-up procedures\nno consent to participate\npreviously enrolled in ENCHANTED\n\n\n69305 screened, 3310 randomised\n\nIntervention:\n\nLow-dose group (n=1650)\nrtPA 0.6 mg/kg i.v. alteplase, maximum total dose of 60mg\n15% bolus (maximum bolus dose of 9mg)\ninfusion of the remainder of the total dose over 60 minutes\n\nControl:\n\nStandard-dose group (n=1643)\nrtPA 0.9 mg/kg i.v. alteplase, maximum total dose of 90mg\n10% bolus (maximum bolus dose of 9mg)\ninfusion of the remainder of the total dose over 60 minutes\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary: No significant difference in modified Rankin Score of 2-6 (indicates a poor outcome with increasing degree of disability and\u00a0death)\n\n\n\nSecondary:\n\nIncidence of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage reduced in the low-dose alteplase group\nMortality at 7 days reduced in low dose group:\u00a03.6% vs\u00a05.3%\u00a0(odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.94; P=0.02)\nNo significant difference between groups in incidence of:\n\nDeath of major disability\nDeath within 90 days\nOverall health utility score on EQ-5D\nAdmission to residential care\nMedian duration of hospitalization\nDeath or neurological deterioration within 72 hours\nSerious adverse events\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors conclusion\n\nIn patients with acute ischaemic stroke who were eligible for thrombolysis, low-dose alteplase was not shown to be non-inferior to standard dose in terms of death and disability\n\nStrengths\n\nInternational, multicentre\nAssessor blinded\nThrombolysis protocol\u00a0based on most commonly adopted practice\n\nWeakness\n\nOver 60% of patients recruited were Asian which may limit external validity\nNot powered to detect difference between Asian and non-Asian population\nMain reasons patients with ischaemic stroke were excluded was inability to deliver thrombolysis therapy within 4.5 hours\nApproximately 10% of patients in both groups were excluded in final per-protocol analysis\nNo consideration of occlusion site or interventional recanalisation strategies\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nData from previous meta-analysis suggest an increase risk of symptomatic and fatal intracranial haemorrhage with the use of thrombolysis. This trial fails to demonstrate non-inferiority (or superiority) of low-dose alteplase compared to standard-dose. With the results of this trial, standard dose alteplase should remain in institutions that are able to provide thrombolytic therapy for acute ischaemic stoke.\n\nExternal links\n\n[Article] Low-Dose versus Standard-Dose Intravenous Alteplase in Acute Ischemic Stroke\n[Further reading]\u00a0Supplementary material\n[Further reading] Thrombolysis in acute ischaemic stroke: time for a rethink?\n[Further reading] LITFL: Stroke Thrombolysis\n[Further reading] R.E.B.E.L EM:\u00a0The ENCHANTED Trial: Is Low-Dose the Right Dose for Intravenous tPA in Acute Ischemic Stroke?\n[Further reading] EMNerd (EMCrit)The Case of the Non-inferior Inferiority Continues\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Adrian Wong\nSummary date: 25th May 2016\nPeer-review editor: Dave Slessor\n\n\n"
