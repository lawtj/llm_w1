Lancet 2017;\u00a0Published Online April 26, 2017 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/ S0140-6736(17)30638-4\nClinical Question\n\nDoes the early administration of tranexamic acid (TXA), compared with placebo, reduce death from bleeding in women with post-partum haemorrhage (PPH)?\n\nBackground\n\nPPH (blood loss > 500mls within 24 hours of giving birth) is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide\nTXA acid reduces bleeding by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of fibrinogen and fibrin by plasmin\nCRASH-2\u00a0demonstrated that TXA reduces all cause death at 4 weeks in trauma patients (Absolute Risk Reduction 1.5%). A subgroup analysis demonstrated a 0.8% ARR reduction in death secondary to bleeding with TXA\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised Controlled Trial\nDouble-blinded\nSealed envelopes containing randomisation codes\nIntention to treat analysis\nA sample size of 20,000 patients was calculated to provide sufficient power to detect an absolute reduction in mortality from 3% to 2.25% (25% relative risk reduction) at the 5% significance level\n\nSetting\n\n193 hospitals in 23 countries\nMarch 2010 \u2013 April 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: women aged 16 years or over with a clinical diagnosis of PPH after a vaginal birth or caesarian section\nExclusion: clinician decision that it would\u00a0be inappropriate for individual to receive or not receive tranexamic acid or some other treatment could be offered outside the trial\n20060 enrolled\nBaseline characteristics were very well balanced\n\nIncluded age, type of delivery (71% vaginal; 29% caesarean section); placenta fully delivered in 90% cases; primary cause for haemorrhage (uterine atony 2/3rds), and haemodynamic parameters\nEstimated blood loss was between 500-1000ml in 50% of cases. Estimated blood loss was <1500ml in 80% of cases\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nTranexamic Acid (n=10036)\n\n1g (10mg/ml) administered intravenously over 10 minutes\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo (n=9885)\n\nIdentical packaging and volume administered intravenously over 10 minutes\n\n\n\nIn both groups\n\nIf bleeding continued after 30 minutes or stopped and then re-started within 24 hours of the first dose, a second dose of study drug was administered\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\u00a0Composite endpoint of death from all causes or hysterectomy within 42 days of randomisation:\u00a0No statistical difference\n\n5\u00b73% in TXA group vs 5\u00b75% in the placebo group\n95% CI 0\u00b787-1\u00b709; p=0\u00b765\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nDeath due to bleeding: statistically significantly reduced in TXA group\n\n155 (1\u00b75%) of 10 036 vs 191 (1\u00b79%); risk ratio [RR] 0\u00b781, 95% CI 0\u00b765\u20131\u00b700; p=0\u00b7045\nAbsolute risk reduction 0.4%; NNT 267; Fragility Index 0\nAfter adjusting for baseline risk, the RR for death due to bleeding with TXA was 0\u00b778 (95% CI 0\u00b762\u20130\u00b798; p=0\u00b703)\n\n\nOther sub-group causes of death:\n\n\u2018Any cause\u2019 of death: reduced mortality 2.3% vs 2.6% in the TXA group but no statistical difference P=0.16\nPulmonary embolism; organ failure; sepsis; eclampsia: No statistical difference\n\n\n\n\nOther secondary outcomes: no statistical difference in:\n\nThromboembolic events (deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke)\nSurgical interventions (intrauterine tamponade, embolisation, brace sutures, arterial ligation, hysterectomy, and laparotomies done after randomisation to control bleeding and achieve haemostasis)\nComplications (renal failure, cardiac failure, respiratory failure, hepatic failure, sepsis, and seizures), other untoward medical events (adverse events)\nQuality of life measured using the EQ5D\n\n\n\n\nTiming of tranexamic acid\n\nTXA within 3 h of giving birth\n\nreduced death 1\u00b72% vs 1\u00b77% RR 0\u00b769, 95% CI 0\u00b752\u20130\u00b791; p=0\u00b7008\n\n\nTXA after 3 h of giving birth\n\nincreased death 2\u00b76% vs 2\u00b75% RR 1\u00b707, 95% CI 0\u00b776\u20131\u00b751; p=0\u00b770\n\n\nNo heterogeneity in the effect by type of birth or cause of bleeding\n\n\n\nEffects of TXA on maternal death\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nTranexamic acid reduces death due to bleeding in women with post-partum haemorrhage with no adverse effects. When used as a treatment for post-partum haemorrhage, tranexamic acid should be given as soon as possible after bleeding onset\n\nStrengths\n\nLarge, multicentre, international RCT\nAmpoules and packaging were identical in appearance and prepared by an independent pharmaceutical company\nCorrect masking and coding of ampoules was checked by independent random testing of each batch by high-performance liquid chromatography to confirm the contents of the ampoules\nOnly 33 patients (0.16%) were lost to follow-up\nTrial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00872469)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nTwo important design changes occurred with the study after it was commenced\n\nSample size increased by 5000 patients during the study. The rationale for this was based on an anticipated baseline event rate of 2.5% for death and 2.5% for hysterectomy and that 1% of women die after hysterectomy. However, during the trial it became apparent that the decision to conduct a hysterectomy was often made at the same time as randomisation. Although TXA could influence the risk of death in these cases, it could not affect the risk of hysterectomy. The sample size was therefore increased from 15,000 to 20,000 with the intention that this might compensate for the dilution of the treatment effect from hysterectomies that were done at the same time as randomisation and that the study had enough power to detect a reduction in death from PPH\nStudy hypothesis was refined\u00a0after commencing the study in light of outcome findings from the CRASH-2 study (published in 2011). The authors explain that mortality with death due to bleeding was changed to the main secondary outcome. This was done before un-blinding and without knowledge of the trial results\n\n\nThere was no formal screening for embolic complications and perhaps these were missed, particularly as follow-up was limited to hospital discharge or on 42 days if still in hospital\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTranexamic acid may be beneficial in reducing the risk of death due to post-partum haemorrhage. The study has some significant methodological limitations, including a change in power calculation and hypothesis after it was commenced, as well as a low fragility index. On the basis of it being cheap with a good safety profile in this study, consider giving tranexamic early in post-partum haemorrhage. Early resuscitation, management of coagulopathy and surgical assistance with source control, are the most important interventions\n\nInfographic\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Paper] WOMAN trial \u2013 Lancet\n[Editorial]\u00a0WOMAN: reducing maternal deaths with tranexamic acid\n[videocast] WOMAN \u2013 TXA History\n[further reading] BroomeDocs \u2013 Thoughts on the WOMAN Trial\n[further reading] CRASH-2\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Steve Mathieu\nSummary date: 2nd May 2017\nPeer-review editor: Celia Bradford\n\n\n"
