Albicans was most frequently isolated (57%) followed by C. Glabrata (21%)\nCrude 30-day mortality across all types of ICI (candidemia and intra-abdominal) was 42%\n\n\nSimilar mortality rates (~40%) were shown in the AMARCand2 study and EPICII study\nThe AMARCand2 study was a prospective observational study evaluating those with suspected or confirmed ICI\n\nOf the ~50% with ultimately proven ICI, only 27% received systemic antifungals prior to mycological confirmation\nAdditionally, in those whom ICI was not proven, the median duration of systemic antifungals was 10 days\nThis prolonged duration of ultimately unnecessary antifungals could be due to diagnostic difficulties of ICI. These have been highlighted in the accompanying editorial.\n\n\nThe ESICM/ESCMID guidelines for ICI management in the critically ill recommend that empirical antifungal treatment only be considered in those with septic shock, MOF and at least 1 extra-digestive site with proven Candida colonisation\nBDG, which is a fungal cell wall component, has been studied as a potential tool to help ameliorate some of these diagnostic uncertainties\n\nPrevious trials have shown its use to be safe, and that it might be helpful to identify those who benefit from empirical antifungal treatment\nGuidelines don\u2019t recommend it\u2019s use to trigger antifungal treatment due to limited data, however the ESICM and ESCMID guidelines suggest that to improve specificity either a higher cut off (e.g. 200 pg/ml) or the requirement of two consecutive positive tests could be used\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nOpen, randomized multicentre trial\nWritten, informed consent from patients or legal representative\nRandomized in a 1:1 ratio using web-based software\n\nStratified by study centre\n\n\nFor BDG sampling:\n\nBDG samples and blood cultures taken within 1 hour of enrolment and 24 hours following\nFungitell assay used to measure BDG concentrations in a central lab\n\n\nCandida PCR sample also taken alongside microbiological samples from throat, skin, rectum/faeces, urine and trachea or bronchial secretions to determine the candida colonisation index (CCI)\n\nPCR results not reported to physicians\n\n\nSample size based on estimated rates of 49.8% in control and 34.2% in BDG group\n\n348 patients required for 80% power, a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and 10% drop out rate\n\n\nRegistered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02734550)\n\nSetting\n\n18 ICUs in Germany\nSeptember 2016 to September 2019\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdult patient with sepsis (defined as proven or suspected infection and organ dysfunction)\nIncreased risk for IC\n\nTPN, abdominal surgery within last 7 days, >48 hours of antibiotics within last 7 days, CRRT use\n\n\nWithin 24 hours of onset of sepsis\n\nInitially was 12 hours but changed in January 2018\n\n\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nProven ICI\nOngoing or immediately planned systemic antifungal treatment\nChild Pugh C cirrhosis\nCardiopulmonary bypass or treatment with immunoglobulins within last 4 weeks\nImmunosuppression\nPregnancy or lactation\nNo commitment to full support (e.g. DNR) or imminent death\n\n\n2324 screened \u2013> 342 randomised\n\n2 withdrew consent in control group \u2013> n = 167\n1 withdrew consent in BDG group \u2013> n = 172\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of BDG vs. control group\n\nAge: 70 vs 71\nMale: 67.6% vs 62.1%\nAPACHE II: 20.5 vs 20\nSOFA: 12 vs 13\nLactate: 2.8 vs 2.7\nSeptic Shock: 87.9% vs 92.9%\nOn antimicrobials: 98.3% vs 97.6%\nMechanical Ventilation: 80.3% vs 82.1%\nTime to randomisation: 13.9 vs 12.6 hours\nSepsis:\n\nPulmonary: 22% vs 24%\nAbdominal: 60.1% vs 65.3%\n\n\nRisk Factors for ICI:\n\nTPN: 6.4% vs 7.7%\nAbdominal Surgery: 67.6% vs 70.4%\nAntimicrobials: 45.1% vs 43.2%\nRRT: 8.7% vs 11.8%\n\n\nInitial blood culture positive for candida: 4.6% vs 4.1%\nICI: 14.5% vs 13.8%\nBaseline BDG (pg/ml): 73 vs 61\n24-hour BDG (pg/ml): 58 vs 56\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nBDG guided\n\nFirst BDG result available within 24 hours, and treating physicians informed of result via phone and fax\nIf any BDG serum concentration \u2265 80 pg/ml then antifungals commenced in accordance with European guidelines\nIf one BDG concentration > 80 pg/ml and cultures negative, then antifungals could be ceased\nIf culture results for candida spp. negative, then antifungal treatment still continued if both BDG concentrations \u2265 80 pg/ml\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard care \u2013 diagnosis of ICI and subsequent antifungal from culture-based methods only\nBDG levels taken but not expedited and not used to guide management\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nNo specific management stated\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: 28-day mortality\n\n33.7% (BDG) vs 30.5% (standard care)\n\nRR 1.1 95% CI 0.80\u20131.51;
