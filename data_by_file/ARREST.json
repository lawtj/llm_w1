The Lancet 2020; https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32338-2\nClinical Question\n\nIn adults suffering out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) presenting with an initial rhythm of VF or pulseless VT, does the implementation of early ECMO facilitated resuscitation compared to standard ACLS resuscitation improve survival to hospital discharge?\n\nBackground\n\nOHCA has a well documented poor survival rate\n\nThe PARAMEDIC 2\u00a0trial showed a 30day survival rate of 2.8% for all cause OHCA\n\n\nHalf of all patients with VF and OHCA have refractory VF which has a much worse prognosis\nThe evidence for the use of ECMO in OHCA is from observational cohort studies with no randomised trials to date\n\nELSO survival to hospital discharge in 2016 registry database for OHCA refractory was 29% for 2885 cases\nOther studies looking at ECMO and PCI in OHCA show survival rates to hospital discharge from 5.5% to 45% for all cause OHCA\n\n\u00a0In those that reported VF/VT this ranged 29% to 55.6%\nThese are small studies ranging from 7 \u2013 234 patients\n\n\n\n\nThe 2CHEER trial published this year (both OHCA and IHCA with presumed cardio-respiratory origin), showed 44% of patients had survival to hospital discharge with a favourable neurological outcome\n\nDesign\n\nPhase 2, single centre, open-label RCT\nOn hospital arrival, member of study team would verify eligibility and randomisation would occur\n\nComputer generated randomisation schedule\nRandom permutations in blocks of 2,4,6\n\n\nFunctional assessment at 3 and 6 months done by qualified assessors blinded to group allocation\nPre-specified secondary outcomes included:\n\nSurvival and favourable neurological outcome (mRS 3 or under) at 3 and 6 months post discharge\n\nFavorable defined as Modified Rankin Score (mRS) 3 or under and Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) Scale 2 or under\n\n\n\n\nAll major adverse events recorded\nRegistered\u00a0with\u00a0ClinicalTrials.gov\u00a0NCT03880565\nEmergency consent process \u2013 had to provide written informed consent within 24 hours of waking\nMixed Bayesian and Frequentist statistical analysis\n\nPrimary outcome analysed every 30 participants using Bayesian statistics\n\nInitial 30 patients will be approximately randomised in 1:1 ratio to ensure balance\nSubsequent Bayesian analysis (conducted every 30 patients) will determine ratios moving forward based on posterior probabilities generated (for both outcomes, namely ECMO is better than ACLS and vice versa)\n\ni.e. if posterior probability that ECMO better is 0.58, and the posterior probability that ACLS better is 0.42, the next 30 randomisation will be weighted 58:42 towards ECMO\n\nThis prevents too many patients being randomised to an inferior treatment\n\n\n\n\nData safety and monitoring board alerted if at any of these reviews the posterior probability is > 0.986 (i.e. 98.6% probability that either ECMO better than standard ACLS or vice versa)\n\n\nSample size calculated at 174 patients\n\nThis is based on ECMO survival being 37% and ACLS 12%, with 90% power and type 1 error rate of 0.05 and allowing 15% withdrawal and false positive activation rate\n\n\nSecondary outcomes

(7%)\nPosterior probability of 0.9861 of ECMO superiority\n\nPre-specified boundary for trial cessation was 0.986 \u2013 trial stopped at this point given strong evidence for efficacy (probability greater than pre-specified boundary)\n\n\nFragility index 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nAnalysed with frequentist models\nCumulative survival significantly better with early ECMO\n\nHazard Ratio 0.16 (95% CI 0.06 \u2013 0.41), p < 0.0001\n\n\nThe 1 survivor in ACLS group died prior to 3 month assessments\n6 month survival: 43% in ECMO group vs. 0% in ACLS group\nSurvivors in ECMO group had good functional outcomes at 6 months\n\nmRS 1.3\nCPC 1.16\n\n\nLength of ICU stay for survivors in ECMO group: 21.5 days (9 \u2013 45)\nLength of hospital stay for survivors in ECMO group: 25.5\u00a0 days (11 \u2013 48)\n\n\nAdverse Events:\n\nTotal number: 166 vs 47 events. A majority of these related to the multi-organ failure and resuscitation attempts (eg. need for vasoactive medication, acute liver injury, need for RRT, rib fractures etc)\nDevice related events: 0\nProcedure related events:\n\nCracked tubing connector replaced: 1/13 (8%)\nAccess site bleeding needing > 3u PRBC: 2/13 (15%)\nIVC trauma, retroperitoneal bleeding: 1/13 (8%)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nEarly ECMO-facilitated resuscitation for patients with OHCA and refractory VF significantly improved survival to hospital discharge when compared to standard ACLS treatment\n\nStrengths\n\nWell done randomised trial in a logistically complex cohort of patients\n\nRandomisation in this trial minimises selection bias, which may be present in observational cohort studies\nChoice of focusing on VF/VT sensible rather than all OHCA as this group seems to have a better chance of survival\nFast times from randomisation to ECMO initiation (12 minutes)\n\n\nAnalysed on ITT basis\nExcellent safety reporting measures\n\nAppendix lists 60 ECMO device related events that need to be recorded\n\n\nThe statistical plan for randomisation ratios seems complex but given the evidence base prior surrounding ECMO and its improved survival rates then the protocol to continually adapt the numbers of patients randomised to each arm based on regularly assessed probabilities that one treatment is more efficacious (with regards to 6 month survival) is strong\n\nThis would help allay any participants fears that in a trial you have a 50:50 chance of potentially receiving a less effective treatment (based on prior data)\n\n\nNon-informative, neutral prior used\n\nThe prior selection can alter Bayesian findings (see Bayesian Statistics explanation)\n\n\nResults similar to other trials involving ECMO\n\nA similar study by the same author in 2017 in which 62 patients were treated with ECMO and PCI with the same inclusion criteria showed 45% survival to hospital discharge and 42% with CPC 1 or 2 at 3 months.\nSlightly different study populations have also shown similar results. Mobile ECMO initiation in Minnesota resulted in 43% hospital discharge and 3 month survival with CPC 1 or 2. The CHEER and 2CHEER trial have shown similarly high survival rates.\nIf ongoing studies continue to show this degree of benefit then the NNT will be low (as shown here)\n\nFurther work would also inform the risk of adverse events with ECMO\n\n\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle center study reduces external validity\n\nThis is especially important in centres where scene and transport time may be longer than ~45 minutes.\nHigh rates of bystander CPR and fast times to first shock\n\nAus-ROC cohort study has bystander CPR rates at 41% (36 \u2013 50%)\n\n\n\n\nSmall numbers of patients\n\nGiven the resources required and frequency of presentations these trials will never randomised very large numbers of patients\nHow did early cessation affect the trial outcome?\n\nPre-specified boundaries rightly placed for trial safety\nUncertain effect of trial cessation with only 15 patients in each arm.\n\nHow many more survivors would be needed in ACLS group to reduce the Bayesian probability to under <0.986?\n\nThe probability of superiority was only 0.0001 above the cut off (98.61% likely that ECMO superior to standard ACLS). Would one more survivor in ACLS group have caused the DMSB to continue recruiting until the next interim analysis as the probability of effect would be < 0.986? If so, would these extra 30 patients change the outcome?\n\n\n\n\nHowever, as the authors state, the similarity of these results to the previously published work does increase the robustness\n\nThe results are almost identical to the similar, non randomised study conducted in the same centre in 2017.\n\n\n\n\nA multi-centre RCT would be ideal following this trial\n\n\nIt would be interesting to see the breakdown of CPC scores\n\nPersonally, the difference between CPC 1 and 2 would have a very different perceived quality of my life\n\n\nNo cost analysis done despite being one of the listed secondary outcomes on the trial protocol\nLow fragility index\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis randomised trial showed early initiation ECMO resulted in an impressive 43% survival to hospital discharge for refractory shockable OHCA\nThe numbers involved were small, and this study was carried out in a centre that was experienced. It is therefore important for other centres to consider their expertise, local protocols and transport times\nFurther randomised work is being carried out (e.g. INCEPTION trial) and the results of these ongoing studies should provide a bigger evidence base to inform practice\nI would advocate for the ongoing use of early ECMO in this patient cohort given the poor survival rates for standard ACLS\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Advanced reperfusion strategies for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and refractory ventricular fibrillation (ARREST): a phase 2, single centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial\n[further reading] ELSO\u00a0\n[further reading] CPC Score\n[further reading/listening] EDECMO Podcast\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker @hgmwalker89\nSummary date: 15th November 2020\nPeer-review editor: @david slessor\n\n\n"
