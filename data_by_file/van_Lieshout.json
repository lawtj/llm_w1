Intensive Care Medicine 2016; 42: 1146\u20131154. DOI: 10.1007/s00134-016-4355-y\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients requiring interhospital ground transport, is a nurse-led transfer team non-inferior to a physician-led team, for\u00a0the proportion of patients with critical events?\n\nDesign\n\nNon-inferiority study\nProspective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial (PROBE design)\nWeb-based randomisation using permuted blocks of variable size, stratified by inter-hospital distance\nBlinding of referring hospital during pre-transport stabilisation period\nBlinded assessment of electronic health record\u00a0to determine adverse clinical events\nConsecutive patients\n274 patient required to power the study at 80% to detect a non-inferiority margin of 0.03\nOne-sided Z test used with a significance level targeted at 0.05\nNon-inferiority was assumed if the upper limit of the two-sided 90% confidence interval for between-group difference was below the non-inferiority margin of 3%.\n\nSetting\n\nSingle Academic Medical Centre in the Netherlands\nData collected between January 2006 and March 2008.\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria: Mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients to be transported by a mobile critical care unit\nExclusion criteria: Severe hypoxia (p/F ratio < 100 with > 15 cmH20 PEEP); haemodynamic instability (MAP < 60mmHg despite vasopressor support and IV fluid resuscitation), post cardiac arrest, requiring immediate transport\n618 patients assessed for eligibility, with 298 patients analysed after dropouts due to exclusion, insufficient data, emergency transport or transport cancellation.\nBoth groups were well-matched at baseline. Comparing intervention vs control group:\n\nAPACHE II score: 19 vs. 18\nMedian transport time: 66min vs. 65min\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nNurse\u00a0led inter-hospital transport (n=147)\n\nA dedicated transport team staffed by a critical care nurse (with at least two years ICU experience) accompanied by a paramedic (with at least 5 years pre-hospital experience and licensed in advanced cardiac life support including rescue endotracheal intubation)\nA critical care physician accompanied every transport for safety reasons but was not physically present in the patient compartment of the ambulance.\n12 patients crossed over to the control arm post\u00a0randomisation due to clinical requirement. This was prior to leaving the referring hospital.\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPhysician led inter-hospital transport (n=151)\n\nThe transport team included a critical care physician (European board-certified intensivist/anaesthesiologist, or a senior resident in anaesthesiology with at least six months ICU experience) in addition to a nurse and paramedic.\n\n\n\nFor both intervention and control groups:\n\nPhysician and nursing staff from single Academic Medical Centre\nBoth nurses and clinicians completed the extended critical care transport training of the Academic Medical Centre\nThe equipment and transport ambulance used was identical.\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: The number of patients with critical events, which included both clinical and technical events during transport\n\nClinical events were defined as a reduction in O2 sats of > 10% for > 10 minutes, a rise or fall in blood pressure of > 20mmHg for > 10 minutes, a temperature fall below 36 degrees, blood loss > 250 mls, arrhythmias with hypotension or death\nTechnical events, defined as related to technical aspects of critical care transport, included ECG lead disconnections, loss of battery power or any other technical equipment failure, airway loss requiring airway manipulation or re-intubation, loss of any intravascular device, or dislodgment of any chest tube, Foley catheter, or surgical drain\nNon-inferiority of the intervention was not established\n\nComparing intervention with control group there was 16.3% vs. 15.2% critical events (difference 1.1%, 90% CI [-5.9 to 8.1]; p= 0.38)\nFragility index: -11 patients\nNo haemorrhages, arrhythmias or deaths were reported in either group\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes \u2013 Comparing intervention vs. control group\n\nClinical incidents \u2013 no significant difference\n\n13.6% vs. 14.6%\u00a0(difference -1%, 90% CI [-5.2 to 8.7]; p=0.44)\n\n\nTechnical incidents \u2013 no significant difference\n\n2.7% vs. 0.7%\u00a0(difference 2.1%, 90% CI [0.7 to 5.3]; p= 0.35)\n\n\nNo difference in ventilator adjustments or changes to sedative/ vasoactive medication\nA trend towards increased fluid therapy >\u00a01000mls in the physician group\n\n5.4% vs. 11.3% (difference -5.9% 95% C.I. [-12.5 to 0.5]\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThis study could not establish the non-inferiority of nurse-led inter-hospital critical care transport. The number of patients with critical events during transport did not differ substantially between the physician and nurse-led groups but a larger study would be needed to definitively show this.\n\nStrengths\n\nAppropriate study design \u2013 randomised, controlled, non-inferiority study\nA power calculation was performed to detect a difference in critical event rate between the two group of less than 3%\nThe web-based permuted block randomisation, with variable block size, ensured allocation concealment\nRandomisation was stratified to ensure similar transport times in both study groups\nGroups were well-matched at baseline\nMean APACHE II scores in the intervention and control groups was 19 and 18 respectively, so the patients recruited were a reasonably sick cohort.\nOutcome parameters were assessed using anonymised electronic medical records to ensure blinding of the allocation group\nAn electronic health record was used to record clinical data on a minute-by-minute basis, reducing clinician reporting bias.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle centre study, limiting external validity\nThe sickest cohort of ICU patients was excluded. These were patients with severe hypoxia and haemodynamic instability and patients requiring immediate transport\nInsufficiently powered to detect non-inferiority due to a higher than anticipated critical event rate\nThe primary outcome was the occurrence of critical events that were based on \u201cexpert opinion\u201d. These were all surrogate outcomes that may not necessarily have had clinical relevance. Clinical events ranged from relatively benign outcomes such as a rise in systolic blood pressure of 20mmHg to sustained hypoxia. No breakdown was given of the clinical events that occurred in each group\nA physician was present in the ambulance vehicle in the intervention arm, which may have influenced the behaviour of the nurse/ paramedic transfer team\nThe higher than anticipated event rate may have been due to the increased sensitivity of electronic health record analysis but may also have been due to suboptimal patient care during transport\nThe response to abnormal clinical events, rather than their occurrence, may more accurately reflect the competence of the transferring team.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nStable ICU patients without severe hypoxia or haemodynamic instability may have similar rates of critical events when transferred by a nurse/paramedic team compared with a physician led team, but an adequately powered study is required to establish this.\nIn the hospital I currently work in, physicians are part of the team performing inter-hospital transfers of critical care patients.\u00a0This paper does not provide enough evidence to change this practice.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0Nurses versus physician-led interhospital critical care transport: a randomized non-inferiority trial\n[article]\u00a0Free full text\n[further reading]\u00a0ESICM Journal Club Review\n\u00a0[further listening] Scott Aberegg on non-inferiority trials\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Fraser Magee @Fraz65\nSummary date:\u00a023/08/2016\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@davidslessor\n\n\n"
