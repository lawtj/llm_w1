NEJM 2015; 372:1898-1908. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1411480\nClinical Question\n\nIn children suffering an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, does hypothermia compared to normothermia increase survival with a good neurobehavioural outcome?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\n1:1 ratio allocated by permuted blocks stratified according to clinical centre and age group (<2 years, 2 to 12 years and >12 years)\nRandomised by telephone-based system with internet-based and sealed envelope backup system\nStudy design, protocol, statistical plan and pilot trial published a priori\u00a0including a pre-specified modified intention-to-treat analysis\nPowered at 85% to detect an absolute treatment effect of 20% with 276 patients, based upon an estimated baseline outcome rate of 15 to 35% in the normothermia group.\nNon-blinded clinicians; blinded centralised outcome assessors\n\nSetting\n\n38 sites across the USA and Canada\nSeptember 2009 to December 2012\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nChildren aged between 48 hours and 18 years\nCardiac arrest requiring at least 2 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nRemained dependent on mechanical ventilation once return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nInability to randomise within 6 hours; a motor score of 5 or 6 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)\nDecision to withhold aggressive treatment\nMajor trauma associated with cardiac arrest\n\n\n1355 met inclusion criteria, 475 eligible, 295 randomised, 260 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis\nBaseline characteristics were similar (hypothermia vs normothermia group):\n\nAge categories\n\nUnder 2 years: 49% vs 52%\n2 to 12 years: 31% vs 32%\nOver 12 years: 20% vs 16%\n\n\nPresence of co-morbidities: 52% vs 51%\nCause of cardiac arrest\n\nRespiratory: 72% vs 73%\nCardiovascular: 9% vs 13%\nOther or unknown: 19% vs 14%\n\n\nWitnessed arrest: 40% vs 38%\nBystander CPR: 68% vs 63%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nTherapeutic hypothermia\n\nCore temperature targeted at 33.0\u00baC (range 32.0 to 34.0) for 48 hours\nRewarmed over at least 16 hours to 36.8\u00baC (range 36.0 to 37.5)\nNormothermia maintained until completion of 120-hour intervention period\n\n\n\nControl\n\nTherapeutic normothermia\n\nCore temperature targeted at 36.8\u00baC (range 36.0 to 37.5) for entire 120-hour intervention period\n\n\n\nManaging common to both groups\n\nPharmacologically sedated (recommended midazolam and fentanyl) and paralysed if required (recommended vecuronium)\nSurface cooling applied\nDual central temperature monitoring with closed loop system\n\nOesophageal probe was primary\nBladder or rectal probe was secondary\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nThere was no statistically significant difference in survival to 12 months with good neurobehavioural outcome (age-corrected standard score of 70 or higher on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale 2nd ed. [VABS-II])\n\nHypothermia group: 20%\nNormothermia group: 12%\nAbsolute risk difference: 7.3% (95% CI -1.5 to 16.1)\nRelative likelihood: 1.54 (95% CI 0.86 to 2.76, p-value=0.14)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nSurvival to 12 months was not different\nSurvival over time was significantly longer with therapeutic hypothermia (p-value = 0.04 by log-rank test)\n\nHypothermia group: mean survival was 149\u00b114 days\nNormothermia group: mean survival was 119\u00b114 days\n\n\nChange in neurobehavioural function was not different between the two groups\n\n\nTertiary safety data:\n\nAdverse events (infection, bleeding, dysrhythmias) occurred similarly between the two groups\nHypokalaemia and thrombocytopenia occurred more frequently in the hypothermia group\nRenal-replacement therapy was required more frequently in the normothermia group\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nTherapeutic hypothermia in children who have return of spontaneous circulation after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest does not improve survival with good function at 1 year compared with therapeutic normothermia\n\nStrengths\n\nWell constructed trial with a priori\u00a0publication of pilot data and methodology\nInclusion of all ages of children, with block randomisation to minimise potential uneven distribution of ages\nIncluded shockable and non-shockable presentation rhythms\n\nWeaknesses\n\nA clinically relevant difference may exist but the trial may have been too small (under-powered) to demonstrate it, resulting in a false negative conclusion\nThe modified intention-to-treat analysis for the primary outcome only included 88% of those randomised (12% loss) due to poor baseline function, unknown status or incomplete data\n\nGiven the primary outcome rate was 12% and 20%, this loss may have significantly altered the outcome\nHowever, sensitivity analyses by per-protocol and imputation of results did not alter the outcome\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTherapeutic hypothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in children cannot be recommended based on the results of this trial\nAlthough this trial demonstrated no difference between normothermia and hypothermia, a false negative conclusion is possible and the confidence intervals are wide\nThe longer survival over time observed with hypothermia may indicate that children treated with therapeutic hypothermia are at similar risk of death but it is delayed due to alterations in the pathophysiology\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Therapeutic Hypothermia after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Children\n[further reading]\u00a0TTM Trial summary by TBL\n[further reading]\u00a0Should children who have a cardiac arrest be treated with therapeutic hypothermia?\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 27 August 2015\nPeer-review editor: @DavidSlessor\n\n\n"
