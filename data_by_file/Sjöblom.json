Anaesthesia 2021 Feb 18; doi:10.1111/anae.15426\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation for emergency surgery, does pre-oxygenation with high-flow nasal oxygen, compared with standard face-mask oxygen, reduce the incidence of oxygen desaturation?\n\nBackground\n\nThe aim of rapid sequence induction (RSI) is to minimise the apnoeic period between the application of oxygen to the patient prior to and during induction and oxygenation via the endotracheal tube following intubation\nHypoxia (most commonly recognised by low oxygen saturations) is a recognised complication of rapid sequence induction, and endotracheal intubation in general\nHigh flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) application has the potential advantage over facemask pre-oxygenation of being continually administered during the apnoea period\nApnoeic oxygenation makes physiologic sense and has been well-described in the medical literature but randomised controlled trials investigating this have only recruited small numbers of patients\u00a0Pavlov systematic review 2017\nApnoeic oxygenation via nasal cannulae is recommended by the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine in the\u00a0Guidelines for the management of tracheal intubation in critically ill adults\nIt is currently unknown whether the continuous flow of oxygen during intubation prevents the incidence of hypoxia during RSI, either in the critical care or anaesthetic room setting\nThis study attempted to answer this clinical question in patients requiring an RSI for surgical intervention\n\nDesign\n\n\n\n\nUnblinded international prospective randomised controlled trial\nPower calculation determined that a sample size of 326 patients would provide 80% power to detect a 7.5% absolute risk reduction in oxygen desaturations using HFNO with a type-1 error of 5%\nThe primary outcome was the number of patients who developed oxygen saturation <93% from the start of pre- oxygenation until 1 min after intubation as measured by peripheral pulse oximeter\nSecondary outcomes were as follows:\n\nDifferences between centres\nEnd-tidal gas concentrations (ETCO2 and ETO2) in the first breath after intubation\nEffect of office hours vs. on- call hours\nThe number of patients with signs of gastric regurgitation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatients were randomly allocated to either pre-oxygenation with high-flow nasal oxygen or with a tight- fitting face mask. This was done using sealed envelopes assigned in a 1:1 ratio in block sizes of 10\n\nSetting\n\nSix centres in Europe (five in Sweden and one in Switzerland) between March 2018 and February 2020\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adult patients undergoing elective surgery where RSI was planned\nExclusion:\n\nBasal metabolic index (BMI) > 35 kg.m2\nPregnancy\nNeed for non-invasive ventilation prior to anaesthesia\nInability to reach oxygen saturations of >93% during pre-oxygentaion\n\n\n350 patients randomly allocated to either pre-oxygenation with HFNO or facemask\nOne patient excluded due to a protocol violation\nThree patients were ventilated during the apnoea phase but were included in the results\n349 patients included in the final analysis\nNo significant difference in baseline or airway characteristics between groups\n\nFacemask group had a higher prevalence of a\u00a0 pulmonary comorbidity (18.3% vs. 13.2%)\nAverage BMI 25.1 in HFNO vs. 25.5 in facemask group\n19.5% HFNO had smoking history vs. 18.4% in facemask group\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nHigh-flow nasal oxygen\n\nAdministered using specifically designed nasal cannulae (Optiflow TM, Fisher and Paykal Healthcare, Auckland, New Zealand) with 30-50 l/min of heated and humidified oxygen\nPatients could breathe with an open or closed mouth\nOxygen flow increased to 70 l/min once apnoea occurred and was administered continuously until the tracheal tube was in place\n\n\n\nControl\n\nTight-fitting facemask\n\n100% oxygen via a tight-fitting facemask with a fresh gas flow of 10 l/min delivered via a circle system\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nStandard monitoring applied\nRapid sequence induction performed according to local protocol at each hospital\nDrugs and doses determined by the anaesthetist in charge\nPre-oxygenation conducted for a minimum of three minutes\nPatients placed supine in a reverse Trendelenburg position\nChin lift and jaw thrust used during apnoea to maintain an open airway\nNo difference in anaesthesia drugs and dosages between groups\n\nPropofol was used as the induction agent in 59% of patients\nThiopentone was used as the induction agent in 36.1% of patients\nSuxamethonium was used as the paralytic agent in 67.0% of patients\nRocuronium was used as the paralytic agent in 32.7% of patients\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: No difference was seen in oxygen desaturation incidence between the HFNO (5 patients; 2.9%) and facemask (six patients; 3.4%) groups (p=0.77)\nNo difference in lowest mean oxygenation saturations from the start of pre-oxygenation until one minute after intubation between the groups (HFNO mean 99.1% vs. facemask 99.0%)\nSecondary outcomes:\nNo significant difference in desaturation incidence between centres\n\nHowever, patients in Switzerland had higher rates of desaturation (7%) when compared with patients in Sweden (1.6%), p=0.009\nSwiss patients also had longer apnoea (125.6 seconds vs. 102.2 seconds; p=0.004) and intubation times 64.2 seconds vs. 47.2 seconds; p=0.013) than Swedish patients\n\n\nNo difference in ETCO2 levels in the first breath after intubation between groups (4.64 vs. 4.56; p=0.33)\nHigher levels of ETO2 in facemask group when compared with HFNO group (84.9 kpa vs. 76.7 kpa; p<0.001)\nNo significant difference in incidence of desaturation between\u00a0 office hours (4.7%) and on-call hours (0.7%; p=0.06)\nOne incident of regurgitation was reported and this was in the HFNO group\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\n\n\nWe have shown that high-flow nasal oxygen is a suitable method for pre- and peri-oxygention to maintain adequate oxygen levels during RSI and is an alternative to traditional facemask pre-oxygenation\n\n\n\n\nStrengths\n\nThis was a well-conducted study with an appropriate power calculation and randomisation strategy\nThere were few exclusion criteria so the study sample population was representative of the general population\nReported baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the two groups and the authors reported on demographic, comorbid and airway variables\nOnly one patient was excluded due to a protocol violation\nPatients were included both in-hours and after-hours, improving generalisability\nThe secondary endpoints were all relevant\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe power calculation was based on an anticipated oxygen desaturation incidence of 10% in the facemask group, but the observed desaturation incidence was only 3.4%. The study may have been underpowered to detect a difference in the primary outcome\nThe overall incidence of oxygen desaturation below 93% was low (3.1%)\nThe primary outcome, whilst reasonable, was not patient centred, and the clinical importance of an oxygen desaturation below 93% is unclear. Oxygen saturations below 85% were only observed in four patients\nThe reason for the difference between Switzerland and Sweden in oxygen desaturation rates, apnoea and intubation times is unclear but does raise the question of significant between-country difference in anaesthetic practice\nNo blinding of the intervention was possible, which may have introduced bias\nNo conclusions can be made about pregnant or obese patients as they were excluded from the study\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis was a well-conducted study and showed no tangible benefit in either HFNO or facemask application for reducing oxygen desaturation in patients undergoing RSI performed by anaesthetists prior to surgery\nThe results are difficult to translate to my critical care practice but I remain unconvinced of the clinical benefits of apnoeic oxygenation via nasal cannulae during intubation\nUsers should continue to use the technique that they are most comfortable with until evidence suggests a change in practice\n\nExternal Links\n\nPre\u2010oxygenation using high\u2010flow nasal oxygen vs. tight facemask during rapid sequence induction\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Fraser Magee\u00a0 @fraz65\nSummary date: 31/03/21\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
