PLOS One June 20 106 doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0155778\nClinical Question\n\nDo observers of\u00a0simulated\u00a0family conversations discussing organ donation\u00a0 respond more favourably to the discussion if it contains extra information about the benefits of donation compared to a standard conversation?\n\nDesign\n\nQuantitative Analytical Research\nRandomised, double blind, controlled trial\nCommunity members were asked to watch one of two videos of a simulated organ donation conversation that differed in the amount of information provided about the benefits of donation\nBoth videos showed the same doctor talking to Joanne, an actor playing the role of a family member of a brain dead patient. The verbal and non-verbal interactions between the \u2018family member\u2019 and the doctor were similar in each video.\nParticipants were unaware they had been allocated to watch one of two videos\nA questionnaire was completed. A 5 point Likert scale was completed covering four domains:\n\nUptake of factual information by study participants\nLevel of discomfort and attitudes of study participants\nInfluence and persuasion of the doctor\nAmount of information about organ donation provided by the doctor\n\n\nWith 252 participants per group, this study had an 80% power to detect a difference in score equal to 25% of 1 standard deviation with a 2-sided p-value of 0.05.\n\nSetting\n\nA request for participation was placed in the electronic newsletter of a large organization in Australia with 30000 employees. Participants were volunteers. No patients were involved in the study\nParticipants completed the survey in February 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: 628 people commenced the survey and entered baseline information about opinions and experiences of organ donation and transplant\n474 people completed the survey.\n239 participants watched the \u2018Control\u2019 video, 235 watched the \u2018Supportive\u2019 video\n\nIntervention\n\nThe \u2018supportive\u2019 video contained information about the potential benefits of donation and transplant, the rarity of the opportunity for donation, and the need for organs for transplantation. In addition, information about the organ donation process was given in order to support informed decision making.\n\nWatch here: http://youtu.be/ewnIq8n6rW0\n\n\n\nControl\n\nThe \u2018control\u2019 video gave basic information about the organ donation process only.\n\nWatch here: http://youtu.be/86B51e5RI-Y\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nUptake of factual information: Before watching the video there was no difference in the knowledge of the rarity of organ donation between the groups. After watching the videos those who watched the \u2018supportive\u2019 video were more aware that \u201cnot many people die in a way that allows them to be an organ donor\u201d. This remained significant after adjustment of baseline variables\n\nAdjusted OR 7.57, 95% CI 5.19-11.04, p < 0.001\n\n\nLevel of discomfort and general attitudes of study participants: There was no difference in how uncomfortable participants were in response to the 2 different styles of conversations.\nAmount of information provided: there was no difference in perceptions that the information provided by the doctor was \u2018enough for Joanne to make a decision\u2019 or that \u2018too much information was given\u2019, however, participants who watched the\u00a0control video were more likely to report that \u2018more information about the benefits of donation should be given.\u2019\n\nAdjusted OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.25-0.50, p < 0.001\n\n\nInfluence and Persuasion by the Doctor: Participants viewing the \u2018supportive\u2019 video were more likely to report \u2018the doctor was trying to convince the family to donate.\u2019 (p <0.001). However, there was no difference in the perception that the doctor cared about the patient and the family (p = 0.21), that the doctor was helping the family come to the right decision (p = 0.43)\u00a0OR that the doctor cared more about transplant recipients than the patient and the family (p = 0.10)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe author concludes that a conversation about the rarity of the donation opportunity and the benefits to others of organ donation during family conversations were well received\n\nStrengths\n\nProspective, randomized, blinded\nParticipants were volunteers but the baseline characteristics suggested they had diverse cultural and educational background. There was a range in ages and gender. The demographics were felt to reflect the demographics of the general community.\nThere was reasonable baseline balance between the participants watching the \u2018supportive\u2019 video and the \u2018control\u2019 video, although those watching the \u2018supportive\u2019 video were more likely to speak a language other than English at home and were slightly older\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe study did not use real patients or real family members. The response of a family member to a conversation may be completely different to an observer of a simulated conversation where there is no emotional connection. This brings into question the external validity of this trial.\nThe randomisation process is not described which makes it difficult to know if there were other external factors influencing the allocation between \u2018supportive\u2019 and \u2018control\u2019 groups.\nLikert scales may be subject to distortion. Responders tend to pick central categories, be influenced by the wording of the question asked, and perhaps respond how they perceive they\u00a0\u2018should\u2019 rather than an honest\u00a0response. Randomisation, and having questions with positive and negative statements can obviate this problem.\nIt is hard to have a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach to family conversations, as different families have different needs. it is difficult to make a mold of the correct conversation.\n154 people who commenced the survey did not complete it. They were more likely female, of the \u2018other religion\u2019 group and more commonly knew someone who was an organ donor compared to those who completed the survey. It is not clear from the paper at what point these people withdrew from the survey. If this was after randomisation and after the videos began then it would be useful to know if these withdrawals were similar in the \u2018supportive\u2019 and \u2018control\u2019 groups\nA selection bias cannot be ruled out here as 44% of those completing the survey reported that they were on the Australian Organ Donor Register\u00a0(versus 23% for the general\u00a0population at the time of the survey.)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFamily conversations are a vital part of caring for the intensive care patient\nThe language used in end of life care including conversations about organ donation is an area that is poorly researched and understood.\nThis trial demonstrates that\u00a0using \u2018supportive\u2019 language is well received suggesting that requestors can be advocates for organ donation, without being perceived as coercive and uncaring.\nAlthough there are significant limitations to the methodology used in this trial, it is a very difficult area to study given the sensitivity of this subject in real patient/family situations. This trial reassures me that using\u00a0\u2018supportive\u2019 language as a designated requestor is acceptable.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Randomised, Double Blind, Controlled Trial of the Provision of Information about the Benefits of Organ Donation during a Family Donation Conversation\n[further reading]\u00a0Modifiable factors influencing relatives\u2019 decisions to offer organ donation: systematic review\n[further reading]\u00a0Optimising the care of the Organ Donation Patient \u2013 Healey; Podcast\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Celia Bradford\nSummary date:\u00a0August 24 2016\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
