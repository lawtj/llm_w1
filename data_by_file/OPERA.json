Intensive Care Med(2016) 42:1888-1898\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients who have undergone major abdominal surgery does the application of high flow nasal cannulae compared with standard oxygen therapy, decrease the incidence of hypoxemia at one hour after extubation?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised clinical trial\nMulticentre\nPatients were pre-consented before surgery\n1:1 randomisation with a computer-generated assignment sequence\nStratification by study centre and the intended use of postoperative epidural analgesia\nModified (excluded 8 patients: 3 had because surgery was cut short due to extensive illness and 5 who had exclusion criteria) intention to treat analysis (8 more patients added to study to achieve full sample size)\nSample size calculation made assuming a 40% incidence of hypoxaemia after extubation, with a 90% power to detect a relative difference of 50% in the primary outcome between the 2 groups\nUnadjusted Chi squared test was used for primary outcome analysis\n\nSetting\n\nThree university hospitals in France\nNovember 2013 \u2013 March 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\u00a0All adult patients scheduled for planned or unplanned abdominal, or abdominal and thoracic surgery with an anticipated duration of 2 hours or more AND having moderate to high risk of post-operative pulmonary complications (ARISCAT risk score >26 points)\nExclusion:\u00a0Life threatening condition requiring emergency surgery, OSA, Pregnancy, BMI >35\n220 patients\nBaseline characteristics (demographics, comorbidities, type of surgery, duration of surgery, pre-op risk score) were similar in both groups\n\nIntervention\n\nHigh Flow Nasal Cannula therapy\n\nGas flow 50-60 L/min\nTarget SpO2\u00a0>95%\n\n\n\nControl\n\nUsual care with standard oxygen therapy\n\nOxygen flow titrated to maintain SpO2\u00a0>95%\nO2 delivery with continuous nasal prongs or facemask\n\n\n\nBoth groups\n\nTreatment stopped on 1st post op day (between 7 \u2013 8AM)\nABG on room air after 1st hour and at the end of treatment period\nTreatment interrupted if acute respiratory failure requiring immediate intubation or if intolerant of assigned therapy\nBaseline\u00a0interventions of the groups were similar (usual care vs HFNC)\n\nDuration of intra-op ventilation 390 vs 377 minutes\nUse of PEEP, recruitment manoeuvres, low tidal volume ventilation\nFluid administration (4000 vs 3250ml)\nBlood transfusion (12% vs 11%)\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcomes:\n\nThe proportion of patients who developed hypoxaemia (P:F <300) 1 hour after extubation: 24% usual care (27/112) vs 21% HFNC (23/108) \u00a0 P=0.62\nThe proportion of patients who developed hypoxaemia (P:F <300) after discontinuation of the study treatment: 30% usual care (34/112) vs 27% HFNC (29/108) P=0.57\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: (usual care vs HFNC).\u00a0 No differences\n\nNeed for additional O2\u00a0at treatment end (82% vs 73%)\nPulmonary complications by day 7 (61% vs 54%)\nHypoxaemia: SpO2\u00a0< 92% on >10L/min, PaO2\u00a0<60mmHg on room air or PaO2\u00a0<80mmHg on supplemental O2\u00a0(27% vs 28%)\nNeed for intubation or NIV (13% vs 19%)\nUnexpected ICU admission (14% vs 15%)\nICU LOS days (5 vs 6)\nHospital LOS days (11 vs 12)\nIn hospital mortality (3% vs 2%)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong patients undergoing major abdominal surgery and receiving intra operative lung protective ventilation, preventive application of HFNC after extubation, compared with standard oxygen therapy, did not result in a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of postoperative hypoxaemia. The routine use of postoperative HFNC after extubation does not seem to be justified in similar patients\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti centre RCT\nWell matched treatment and control groups\nPrimary endpoint of hypoxemia is objective but arguably this is not a clinically meaningful outcome: if the patient is dyspnoeic, needs intubation or NIV these are clinically relevant but a patient with SpO2\u00a0of 92% may be asymptomatic\nAllocation concealment\nFollow-up to hospital discharge seems complete\n\nWeaknesses\n\nStudy protocol did not include standardisation for different aspects of patient care (but it\u2019s a pragmatic trial so this probably doesn\u2019t matter)\nAdherence to use of recruitment manoeuvres during surgery was low (but doesn\u2019t impact results as no imbalance)\nShort duration of HFNC post-op \u2013 was 16 hours long enough to prevent hypoxic complications, or does the risk extend longer than this?\nSingle blinding of statisticians/coordinating centre but patients and staff members collecting data were unblinded.\nThe post hoc analysis of the patients that received recruitment manoeuvres is difficult to interpret given the very small numbers that received these.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis is the first trial to evaluate the usefulness of preventive application of HFNC directly after extubation in abdominal surgical patients. The routine use of HFNC therapy is not warranted but it can still be used judiciously in appropropriately monitored settings with experienced staff. The utility of HFNC therapy in high risk patients and when used for longer durations need to be explored\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of early postextubation high-flow nasal cannula vs conventional oxygen therapy on hypoxaemia in patients after major abdominal surgery: a French multicentre randomised controlled trial (OPERA)\n[further reading]\u00a0Effect of Postextubation HFNC vs Conventional O2 Therapy on Reintubation in Low-risk Patients.
