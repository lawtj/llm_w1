NEJM 2022; 387:1747-58 doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2209083\nClinical Question\n\nIn mechanically ventilated adult patients does the provision of early mobilisation when compared to standard care increase the number of days alive and out of hospital at 180 days?\n\nBackground\n\nICU Acquired weakness (ICUAW) is common with one systematic review reporting a median prevalence of 43%, and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality\nThe pathophysiology of ICUAW is multifactorial, however there is some evidence that suggests a benefit to early mobilisation\nEarly mobilisation has been shown to improve short term outcomes (incidence of ICUAW and improved MRC score)\nAnother meta-analysis showed that it might improve days alive and out of hospital to 180 days\nThe PADIS guidelines suggest performing early rehabilitation and mobilisation in critically ill adults (low quality evidence, conditional recommendation)\nHowever, early mobilisation is not without risk and most trials have been small, and often single centre\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, prospective, parallel group trial\nRandomisation 1:1 ratio\n\nWeb based interface\nStratified by trial centre with variable block sizes\n\n\nIntervention lasted for 28 days\nProvision of physiotherapy unblinded but those involved in patient reported outcomes and statistical analysis were blinded\nPatients who died by day 180 defined as having 0 days alive and out of the hospital\nSample size calculation:\n\nBased on pilot study data\n750 patients would provide 90% power to detect a 7-day between group difference with a two-sided alpha of 0.05\nSample size increased by 15% for non-parametric distribution and 5% loss to follow up\n\n\nAnalysis of primary outcome performed as intention to treat\n\nSetting\n\n49 sites in 6 countries\nFebruary 2018 to November 2021\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n> 18 years old\nIntubated and expected to remain so the day following randomisation\nSufficient cardiorespiratory stability to make mobilisation possible\n\nParameters for what was defined as stable is provided in the supplementary appendix\nSome of these criteria include ventricular rate < 150 bpm, combined noradrenaline / adrenaline rate < 0.2mcg/kg/min, FiO2 < 0.6, PEEP < 16 cm H20, RR < 45 bpm\n\n\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nDependent on ADL prior to ICU admission\nCognitive impairment\nProven or suspected acute primary brain or spinal cord / neuromuscular pathology likely to result in permanent or prolonged weakness\nRest in bed orders / bilateral non-weight bearing orders\nLife expectancy < 180 days\nICU re-admission\n> 72 hours from meeting inclusion criteria\n\n\n750 randomised\n\nEarly mobilisation = 372\nUsual Care = 378\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of early mobilisation vs. usual care group:\n\nAge: 61 vs 60\nFemale Sex: 35 vs 40%\nClinical Frailty Scale (CFS): 3 vs 3\n\nCFS > 5: 11 vs 12%\n\n\nBMI: 30 vs 30\nTime from ICU admission to randomisation: 60 vs 61 hours\nUnplanned ICU admission: 82 vs 84%\nSepsis: 66 vs 66%\nMedian RASS at randomisation: -3 vs -3\nCAM-ICU positive: 4 vs 4%\nPEEP: 9 vs 9 cm H20\nP/F Ratio: 226 vs 230\nVasopressors: 62 vs 62%\nRRT: 22 vs 21%\nCorticosteroids: 46 vs 45%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nEarly mobilisation\n\nSedation minimised to determine IMS level which was used to individually tailor the physiotherapy session for the day (both activity and target duration)\n\nIMS of 0 = no mobilisation, 10 = independent walking\n\n\nThe goal was the \u201chighest level of activity possible for the longest time\u201d\nIf fatigued, then mobilisation stepped down to lower levels\nMobilisation allowed to be split into different sessions\nEach day was tailored based on strength assessment each day\n\n\n\nControl\n\nUsual Care\n\nIf feasible delivered by physiotherapy staff not involved in delivering the intervention\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll other care as per treating teams\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nDays alive and out of hospital at day 180 (median) \u2013 not significant\n\n143 vs 145 (Difference -2, 95% CI -10 to 6), p = 0.62\n\n\n\n\nSubgroups:\n\nNo benefit in any subgroup (Age, CFS, APACHE II, Trauma, COVID-19, Sepsis) except country in which Brazil strongly favoured early mobilisation (however they only randomised 10 patients)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nComparing early mobilisation vs. usual care group\n\nNo significant difference in\n\nDeath at day 180: 22.5% vs 19.5%\nMedian ventilator free days at day 28: 21 vs 21\nMedian ICU free days at day 28: 16 vs 17\nFunctional outcome scores at day 180 (EQ-5D-5L, Barthel Index of ADL, WHODAS 2.0)\n\n\nSignificantly greater in early mobilisation group\n\nPatients with \u22651 adverse event potentially due to mobilization: 9.2% vs 4.1%\n\nOR 2.55 (95% CI 1.33 \u2013 4.89), p = 0.005\nMost common were cardiac arrythmia, altered BP, and desaturation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIncreased early active mobilisation did not affect the number of days that patients were alive and out of the hospital as compared with the usual level of mobilisation received in the ICU\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised, multi-centre trial\nInternational increases external validity\nSmall numbers of protocol violations (Figure S4)\nMinimal loss to follow up \u2013 primary outcome data available for 99.6% of patients\nAchieved separation of physiotherapy delivered and levels of mobilisation achieved between groups\n\nEarly group received 21 compared to 9 minutes of active mobilisation per day\n\n\nExcellent assessment and record of serious adverse events\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnblinded\nApproximately 10% of those assessed were excluded or did not undergo randomisation for \u201cother reasons\u201d\nThere were significant numbers in the early group who did not undergo mobilisation (predominantly due to sedation) \u2013 these numbers decreased with time (Figure S4)\n\nThe frequency of which barriers to mobilisation occurred appears to be ~300 on day 1, ~250 on day 2, ~220 on day 3\n\n\nUsual care group had an increased level of mobilisation that was higher than expected based on the pilot study (Table 2)\n\n41% of usual care group achieved IMS 7, compared to 47% in early group; with median peak IMS the same in both groups (6)\nThis might be a Hawthorne effect, but probably more likely that centres that agreed to participate in this study had well resourced, highly motivated and proactive physiotherapy departments\n\n\nPost ICU care not protocolised\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study shows that when early mobilisation is compared to usual care there was no increase in days alive and out of hospital with greater number of adverse events in the early group\nHowever, the usual care group appears to have also received a high frequency of early mobilisation so this trial does not mean that early physiotherapy input for critically ill patients should be limited and should remain to be an individualised decision based on patient stability, presence of barriers to mobilisation and resource availability\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Early Active
