Anaesthesia 1998;53:867-871. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2044.1998.00342.x\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients undergoing rapid sequence induction, does the use of suxamethonium or rocuronium (at a standard or higher dose), produce better intubating conditions?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised control trial\nBlinding of those performing laryngoscopy (not present in room until ~45 seconds after neuromuscular blocking agent given)\nPower calculation: 260 patients required to detect a difference of 10%\n\nprobability of\n\nfalse negative result 20%\nfalse positive result 5%\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n2 centres \u2013 UK and Finland\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: age 18-75 undergoing elective or emergency surgery requiring tracheal intubation\nExclusion: pregnancy, weight deviated >35% from ideal weight; predicted/known difficult airway\n310 patients included in analysis out of 348 patients enrolled\n\nIntervention\n\nRocuronium at either 0.6mg/kg or 1.0mg/kg\n\nAfter 50 patients included in both groups, study continued with whichever dose gave better intubating conditions\n\n\n\nControl\n\nSuxamethonium 1mg/kg\n\nAll patients treated with pre-oxyenation, 1-2mcg/kg fentanyl, \u00a03-5mg/kg thiopentone and cricoid pressure. Laryngoscopy\u00a0performed 50 seconds after the end of injection of neuromuscular agent. Experience/seniority of person performing laryngoscopy not stated\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nClinically acceptable intubating conditions (i.e. excellent or good) \u2013 no significant difference between suxamethonium 1mg/kg vs rocuronium 1mg/kg\n\nIntubation assessed using 3-point scoring system (excellent, good, or poor)\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nFrequency of good/excellent intubating conditions significantly higher in the 1mg/kg rocuronium \u00a0group vs. \u00a00.6mg/kg rocuronium group\nexcellent intubating conditions significantly more common in\u00a0suxamethonium \u00a0vs\u00a0rocuronium 1mg/kg group\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n1mg/kg rocuronium provides acceptable intubating conditions and similar to suxamethonium\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised\nBlinding of outcome assessors\nAssessed for unmasking i.e. asked if witnessed fasciculations from suxamethonium \u2013 occurred in 5 patients\nStandard induction technique (apart from intervention of interest)\nImportant paper demonstrating that a \u2018higher\u2019 dose of 1mg/kg rocuronium is required to achieve comparable intubating conditions with suxamethonium for RSI\n\nWeaknesses\n\n38 (11%) excluded due to\u00a0major protocol violations or unanticipated difficult intubations for anatomical reasons. This is a significant limitation as the muscle relaxant used may have affected whether or not there was an unanticipated difficult intubation, that may have incorrectly been ascribed to an anatomical reason. In addition as the staff administrating the drugs were non blinded any biases may have led to \u2018major protocol violations\u2019\nSponsored by manufacturers of rocuronium\nPrimary outcome was not a patient orientated outcome. However, without much larger number of patients an outcome such as 1st pass success would not have been adequately powered\nDid not report\u00a0episodes of desaturation or any side-effects\nExperience of doctor performing laryngoscopy not reported\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients undergoing a RSI, who were not anticipated to have a difficult airway, 1mg/kg suxamethonium and 1mg/kg rocuronium produced similar clinically acceptable intubating conditions. Suxamethonium was more likely than rocuronium to produce \u2018excellent\u2019 intubating conditions and is one of the reasons it is preferred by some clinicians. Whether this benefit would make a significant difference in patients with anticipated difficult airway and where \u2018wake up\u2019 is not an option is beyond the scope of this study. Rocuronium seems to be increasingly favoured in this situation as it provides similar early onset of muscle relaxation but lasts longer than suxamethonium. This may provide better conditions to allow ongoing airway management and if necessary progression to a surgical airway.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0Comparison of rocuronium and suxamethonium for use during rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia\n[Further reading]\u00a0LITFL\n[Further reading]\u00a0St. Emelyns Best Bet Sux vs. Roc\n[Further reading]\u00a0RESUSMe Less RSI desaturation with Roc\n[Further reading]\u00a0RESUSMe More on Rocuronium (and Sugammadex)\n[Further reading]\u00a0Cochrane review Sux vs. Roc\n[Further reading]\u00a0PHARM Sux vs Roc \u2013 why Sux still holds an edge in RSI\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DavidSlessor\nSummary date: 20th October 2014\nPeer-review editor: @stevemathieu75\n\n\n"
