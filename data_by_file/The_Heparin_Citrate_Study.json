Journal Crit Care Med 2015;43(8):1622-9. doi: 10.1097/CCM.0000000000001004\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), does regional anticoagulation with citrate prolong circuit life compared to heparin and protamine?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nMulticenter\nRandomisation stratified by study site\nEach site used a randomly generated sequence of numbers in permuted block sizes of 4,6 and 10 to allocated study groups\nIntention to treat analysis\nClinicians unblinded. The statistician was blinded to group allocation until completion of the primary outcome analysis\nSample size calculation: 218 study subjects provided 80% power to detect a difference in mean circuit survival of 4 hours\n\nSetting\n\nSeven ICUs: Six Australian and one New Zealand\n\nFour tertiary referral units and three metropolitan\n\n\nMay 2010 \u2013 January 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: acute renal failure requiring CRRT and suitable for regional anticoagulation of the CRRT circuit; clinical equipoise regarding the method of circuit allocation\nExclusion: expected stay in ICU less than 24 hours; age less than 18 years; pregnant or breastfeeding; suspected ischemic hepatitis or liver failure; known allergy to heparin or protamine; suspected or confirmed heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT); chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis prior to ICU admission.\n212 patients randomised. 857 circuits\nBaseline characteristics between groups were similar in respect to severity of illness and common renal and haematological laboratory results. More patients were admitted to the ICU from the Emergency Department in the heparin group compared with the citrate group (35.5% vs 22.9%)\n\nIntervention\n\nRegional citrate anticoagulation with maintenance of systemic normocalcemia\n\nControl\n\nRegional heparin anticoagulation with protamine reversal to avoid systemic anticoagulation\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: functional circuit life was longer in the group receiving citrate anticoagulation\n\nmedian circuit life of first circuit: 39.2 hours [95% CI, 32.1\u201348.0] vs 22.8 hours [95% CI, 13.3\u201334.0] P=0.0037\ncircuits clotting: 57.9% vs 66.4% P < 0.02\nmedian circuit life of clotted circuits: 16.5 hours (IQR 21.1 hours) vs 11.8 hours (IQR 14.3 hours) P =< 0.0001\nthe hazard ratio for a filter clotting in the heparin group (compared to citrate) was 2.03 (95% CI 1.36-3.03) P=<0.005\n\n\n\nCircuit stopped if one of following occured: transmembrane pressure across the circuit exceeded 300 mm Hg; visible clot was obstructing flow through the machine; the blood pump was unable to rotate due to clot obstruction; other (free-text entry by bedside staff)\n\nSecondary outcomes: No statistical difference between groups\n\nchange in interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and interleukin-10 between randomsation and 48\u201372 hours later\nICU mortality: 26.7% in citrate group vs 23.4% in the heparin group P=0.58\nICU length of stay: 9 days vs 9 days P=0.79\nhospital mortality: 31.4% vs 29% P=0.7\nred cells transfused:\n\npatients transfused: 52% vs 47% P=0.58\nmean volume of red cells: 908 vs 872 P=0.83\n\n\nduration of CRRT\n\ntotal patient time on circuit in hours: 8282 vs 8015\nmedial hours per patient on circuit: 55.7 vs 50.6 P=0.6\n\n\n\n\nAdverse outcomes: there were more adverse events in the heparin group (11 events, three serious) compared with the citrate group (two events, one serious) although this did not reach statistical significance (P= 0.011 for all events). The most common adverse event was suspected or confirmed HIT, resulting in discontinuation of study treatment\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nRegional citrate and calcium anticoagulation prolongs CRRT circuit life compared with regional heparin and protamine anticoagulation, does not affect cytokine levels, and is associated with fewer adverse events\n\nStrengths\n\nRCT\nMulti-centre (although 74% of the patients were from two centres)\nStatistician was blinded to group allocation until after primary analysis\nNo patients lost to follow up\nLarge trial compared to previous trials (857 circuits)\nExamined other factors that could have affected filter life, including coagulation screens, platelet counts, catheter insertion sites, renal replacement modality, blood flow rates and ratio of pre- & post-dilution\n\nWeaknesses\n\nMore patients were admitted to the ICU from the Emergency Department in the heparin group compared with the citrate group (35.5% vs 22.9%)\nUnblinded\nUnderpowered to detect important patient-centered outcomes such as mortality, time in ICU, time in hospital and renal recovery\nA cost analysis would have been useful\nlarge number of patients excluded from study limits external validity \u2013 1219 patients excluded due to not meeting inclusion critera (these all presumably treated with CRRT)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients needing continuous renal replacement therapy, regional anticoagulation with citrate and calcium extends filter life in comparison with regional heparin and systemic reversal with protamine\nGiven the greater efficiency and safety of citrate, serious consideration should be given to its use as first line anticoagulation in continuous renal replacement.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[abstact]\u00a0A Randomized Controlled Trial of Regional Citrate Versus Regional Heparin Anticoagulation for Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy in Critically Ill Adults\n[further reading] Critical Care Reviews Book 2016\n[further reading] The Citrate Story by David Gattas.
