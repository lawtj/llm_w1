Resuscitation 2017;120:14\u201319.\u00a0doi: 10.1016/j.resuscitation.2017.08.238\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients post out of hospital cardiac arrest, does a continuous or on demand application of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) reduce the number of shivering episodes during targeted temperature management (TTM)?\n\nBackground\n\nCurrent resuscitation guidelines advocate a temperature between 32 and 36 degrees\nThis can lead to shivering which can increase metabolic demand and counteract the beneficial effects of TTM\nThere is little research into the role of NMB in this setting to avoid shivering, and some guidelines have not advocated their use due to increased risk of critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy\n\nDesign\n\nRandomized, double blinded, double dummy\nTreatment assignments randomly generated using computer and sealed envelopes\nAllocated in a 1:1 ratio\nNursing staff not involved in the study or patient\u2019s care prepared the continuous or bolus medication (NMB or saline), which maintained blinding of the bedside clinical staff\nLocal ethical approval sought\nRequirement of informed consent at time of inclusion waived, however if there was a favourable outcome then the participant asked to provide written consent.\nCalculated a necessary sample size of 26 patients per group to allow significant difference of 32% probability of at least one shivering episode with 80% power and two-sided type I error of 5%\n\nEstimated baseline shivering episode not stated\n\u2018significant difference of 32%\u2019 not clear if this is absolute difference or relative difference\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nSingle site (patients admitted to Department of Emergency Medicine, Medical University of Vienna) study\nNovember 2010 \u2013 September 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nAdult Patients > 18 years old\nResuscitated from non-traumatic out of hospital arrest (OOHA) within 6 hours of arrival to Emergency Department\nCardiac Arrest had to be presumed cardio-respiratory in origin and had to be eligible for TTM\nTemperature had to be > 35\u02daC on admission\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nKnown terminal illness, intoxication, ward of the state, prisoners, known or suspected pregnancy, allergic reaction to rocuronium, myasthenia gravis, and epileptic disease.\n\n\n782 screened\n\n717 not included (mostly did not meet inclusion / exclusion criteria, 15 excluded due to staff not available)\n65 randomised\n2 excluded (1 from intracranial haemorrhage, 1 unblinded due to ARDS)\n32 in continuous NMB group\n31 in bolus NMB group\n\n\nSimilar baseline characteristics in each group\n\nAge: 62 (continuous NMB) vs. 58 (bolus NMB)\nMale: 81% vs. 84%\nBMI: 28 kg/m2 vs. 28kg/m2\nWitnessed arrest: 91% vs. 90%\nNo BLS: 38% vs. 35%\nVF: 81% vs. 90%\nAdmission after ROSC: 34 min vs. 34 min\nPrehospital administration of NMB: 44% vs. 63%\npH on admission: 7.18 vs. 7.16\nLactate on admission: 7.3 mmol/L vs. 6.9\nGlucose on admission: 256 mg/dL vs. 252\nGCS on admission: 3 vs. 3\nCore temperature on admission: 35.9 vs. 35.8\nPittsburgh Brain Stem Scale Score: 8 vs. 9\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nContinuous infusion of NMB drug\n\nRocuronium as initial bolus of 0.25mg/kg\nFollowed by an infusion of 0.25mg/kg/hr\nIf shivering was noticed then a bolus of (placebo) saline was given\n\n\n\nControl\n\nOn demand bolus of NMB drug\n\nInitial bolus of (placebo) saline\nFollowed by a continuous infusion of (placebo) saline\nIf shivering was noticed then a 0.25mg/kg bolus of rocuronium was given\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nSedation was intravenous fentanyl (2\u00b5g/kg/h) and midazolam (0.125mg/kg/hr)\nBolus of sedation allowed if clinically indicated\nSeverity of shivering was graded using \u201cShivering Assessment Scale\u201d (SAS \u2013 0 to 3 categorical scale)\n\nIf SAS greater or equal to 1 then a bolus of the intervention was given (either rocuronium or placebo depending on group allocation) and sedation increased as an equivalent of 5kg extra body weight\n\n\nStudy medication stopped at 29 hours\nSedation and analgesia ceased at 31 hours\nArterial oxygen\u00a0saturation kept > 95%, PaCO2 kept between 35 and 45 mmHg, MAP > 60mmHg using crystalloids +/- vasopressors and serum blood glucose kept between 110 and 180 mg/dl\nAll patients underwent TTM with a cooling catheter into IVC via a femoral puncture\nCooling rate set to maximum until oesophageal temperature reached 33\u00b0C\nCooling period lasted 24 hours from initiation until start of re-warming, which was performed at a rate of 0.4\u00b0C/hour until a core temperature of 36\u00b0C was reached\nStandardized intensive care monitoring used on all patients\nRelaxation measured using TOF watch every three hours; this was performed by an individual not involved in the clinical management of the patient\nNeurological assessment was done at 1,2,6 and 12 months during the follow up.\nAn independent neurologist evaluated incidence of critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy at 12 months after cardiac arrest through a clinical exam and nerve conduction studies.\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary Outcome: shivering episodes were less frequent in the continuous infusion group compared to the on demand bolus group\n\nContinuous infusion: 25%\nOn demand bolus: 94%\nAbsolute risk reduction (ARR): 68.55% (95% CI 51.2% to 85.9%;

this will affect the external validity of the trial.\nAlthough initially double blinded (medications drawn up by nurse not involved in patients care) the clinical effects of saline or rocuronium may become apparent following administration resulting in an unintentional unblinding\nSignificant numbers of patients were lost to final follow up \u2013 only 14% (9/63) had a neurological examination at one year\n\nTherefore the incidence of polyneuropathy can not be assessed and no conclusions can be drawn surrounding the safety of continuous NMB infusion\nGiven this and\u00a0small sample sizes further work surrounding this should be carried to assess risk-benefit profile of continuous NMB.\n\n\nThere was no assessment for awareness with those having a continuous NMB infusion\nDepending on results of TTM2 this question may not be as relevant in the future\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhen cooling patients after cardiac arrest, if you wait until a patient shivers before administering a neuromuscular blocking drug rather than commencing an infusion from the time of admission, then they will shiver more\nThis trial may indirectly show that by stopping people from shivering, then less sedation is required leading to earlier awakening and potential earlier ICU discharge, however these secondary outcomes should be considered hypothesis generating and further research is required\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Continuous versus intermittent neuromuscular blockade\u00a0in patients during targeted temperature management after\u00a0resuscitation from cardiac arrest\u2014A randomized, double\u00a0blinded, double dummy, clinical trial.\u00a0\n[further reading] Comparison of two sedation regimens during targeted temperature management after cardiac arrest\n[further reading] European Resuscitation Council and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine Guidelines for Post-resuscitation Care 2015: Section 5 of the European Resuscitation Council Guidelines for Resuscitation 2015\n[further reading] Life in the Fast Lane \u2013 We need to talk about TTM\u2026Again\n[further reading] TTM2 Trial\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker\nSummary date: 4 May 2018\nPeer-review editor: Segun Olusanya\n\n\n"
