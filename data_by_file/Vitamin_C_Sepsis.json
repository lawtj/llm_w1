JAMA;\u00a02019;322(13):1261-1270\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome, can intravenous administration of vitamin C, compared to placebo, reduce organ failure scores and biomarkers of inflammation and vascular injury?\n\nBackground\n\nAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is commonly associated with sepsis, and continues to have a high mortality (up to 45% in LUNG-SAFE)\nAnimal studies have suggested a role for vitamin C for attenuating the inflammatory response and vascular lung injury\nA preliminary study in humans in 2014 showed a significant reduction in inflammatory markers and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores- leading to this phase 2 trial\nIn the interim, while this trial was being conducted, a retrospective observational study was published in CHEST\n\nThis paper was based on the preliminary human study above, and showed a significant mortality benefit using a retrospective before and after design\nSignificant debate over the role of vitamin C in sepsis has resulted ever since\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, double blinded, placebo-controlled, multi centre study\n1:1 computer generated randomisation\nBlinding maintained by pharmacy at each institution- they prepared identical amber-coloured bags of vitamin C and placebo\nRandomisation within 24 hours\nBased on a power of 80% and 2 sided alpha of 0.05, multiple computer simulations were run to determine a sample size of 170 (85 per group)\n\nSetting\n\n7 ICUs in the United States\nSept 2014 \u2013 November 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nMechanically ventilated\nPaO2/FiO2 ratio of <300 mmHg\nBilateral opacities on chest X ray\nRecruitment within one week of clinical insult\nNew/worsening respiratory symptoms without evidence of raised left atrial pressure\nSuspected or proven infection\nPositive for 2 out of 4 of Systemic inflammatory Response criteria\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nVitamin C allergy\nAge <18\nNon-English speaking or ward of state\nUnable to gain informed consent\n>48 hours since achieving ARDS criteria\nNo patient surrogate or physician committed to full support\nHome ventilation\nHome oxygen >2L/min\nInterstitial lung disease\nDiffuse alveolar haemorrhage\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\nActive kidney stone\n\n\n1267 patients screened, 170 patients randomised, 167 included in primary analysis\nBaseline characteristics broadly similar between groups. Notable differences:\n\nMore black people in placebo group (23% vs 15%)\nMore respiratory sepsis in intervention group (82% vs 70%)\nMore abdominal sepsis in placebo group (16% vs 7%)\nMore acute kidney injury in placebo group (31% vs 25%)\nWorse P/F ratio in intervention group (189 vs 214)\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n50mg/kg vitamin C (dissolved in 5% dextrose) every 6 hours for 96 hours\n\nControl\n\n5% Dextrose only\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nBoth groups ventilated according to ARDSNet protocol\nFluid managed conservatively according to FACTT Lite protocol, and continued until unassisted breathing or study day 7\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Difference in mean modified SOFA score (Modified by removing bilirubin), CRP and thrombomodulin at 168 hours\nNo significant difference seen in any of the primary outcomes:\n\nSOFA Score differences: 3 point reduction (intervention) vs 3.5 point reduction (control)- 95% CI -1.23 to 1.03, P= 0.86)\nCRP: 54 vs 46.1 micrograms/ml (95% CI -8.23 to 24.1, P= 0.33)\nThrombomodulin 14.5 vs 13.8 ng/ml (95% CI -2.8 to 4.2, P= 0.70)\n\n\nSecondary outcome: 46 prespecified secondary outcomes- out of these, 3 were positive:\n\n28 day mortality (29.8% vs 46.3%, 95% CI 2% to 31%, P= 0.03)\nICU free days to day 28 (Median 11 vs 0 days, P= 0.03)\nHospital free days to day 60 ( Median 22 vs 0 days, P= 0.04)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn this preliminary study of patients with sepsis and ARDS, a 96 hour infusion of vitamin C compared with placebo did not significantly improve organ dysfunction scores or alter markers of inflammation and vascular injury\n\nStrengths\n\nWell randomised and blinded\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\nPower calculation based on previous data\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSignificant numbers of patients were excluded from enrolment, resulting in the trial taking 3 years to complete\n\nThe most common exclusion reason was being enrolled >48hrs post achieving ARDS criteria- this is either a problem with screening, or a reflection of the difficulty in diagnosing ARDS\n\n\nThe primary outcome measure, while based on the previous phase 1 trial, is not one of interest to patients or treating clinicians\n\nApparently this was decided upon by the NIHR, and was not the first choice of the research team (this is based on personal communication with AA Fowler)\n\n\nPatients who died before hour 96 were not included in the primary analysis, essentially giving them an mSOFA score of zero\n\nIf more patients died in the placebo group, their overall mSOFA scores would be lowered as a result\nThis would have nullified any difference in the primary outcome\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis randomised control trial of vitamin C in sepsis-induced ARDS showed no difference in the primary outcome of reduction in SOFA or biomarkers\nThe secondary outcome of mortality is purely hypothesis forming\nVitamin C cannot be recommended for use on the basis of this trial\nI am not currently using Vitamin C routinely in my septic shock or ARDS patients, and will await the results of upcoming large RCTs on its use (VICTAS, VITAMINS)\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]Effect of Vitamin C infusion on organ failure and Biomarkers of inflammation and vascular injury in patients with sepsis and severe acute respiratory failure.\n[Editorial] Is high dose Vitamin C beneficial for patients with sepsis?\n[further reading] Pulmcrit.
