However problems exist with lactate as a target, including:\n\nHyperlactatemia may be caused by factors other than tissue hypoperfusion (ie liver or kidney failure, metabolic changes or drugs)\nLactate normalization may be delayed to after shock resolution\nLactate measurements may not be universally available (ie in developing countries)\n\n\nCapillary refill time (CRT) is a marker of peripheral perfusion and sympathetic nervous system activation, and\u00a0has\u00a0been associated with organ failures and mortality. It may be an alternative target to lactate guided resuscitation, and has several potential advantages over lactate including:\n\nRapidly responds to resuscitation\nIs easy to use\nResource independent method of peripheral perfusion.\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nMulticenter, randomized controlled, superiority trial\nRandom allocation, with central allocation concealment\nRandomization sequence by permutated blocks of 8, with 1:1 allocation via a computer program\nClinicians non blinded\nPower calculation\u00a0\n\n420 patients were included to give a 90% power to detect an absolute risk reduction of of mortality from 45% to 30% (alpha 0.05) (Relative risk reduction of 33%)\n\n\nPrimary outcome calculated using a cox\u00a0proportional hazards after adjusting for 5 pre-specified covariates\nIntention to treat analysis\n\nSetting\n\n28 hospitals in 5 South and Central American countries (Argentina, Chile,\nColombia, Ecuador, Uruguay)\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\u226518 year old patients with early (<4hours) septic shock admitted to the ICU\n\nSeptic shock was defined according to Sepsis-3 definition:\n\nSuspected or confirmed infection\nLactate \u22652\nVasopressors to maintain map \u226565 despite 20ml/kg over 60 minutes\n\n\n\n\nExclusion: Bleeding, severe ARDS, and dialysis patients, and those with a do not resuscitate status\nStudy flow\n\n1327 were assessed for eligibility\n\n903 excluded (286 as \u22654 hours, 208 anticipated surgery or dialysis, 108 do not resuscitate, and 55 eligible but excluded due to logical reasons)\n424 randomized (212 CRT target and 212 lactate target)\n\n\n\n\nBaseline characteristics were similar between groups\n\nMean age 63 years,\u00a0APACHE score\u00a022,\u00a0mean\u00a0SOFA score\u00a09.65.\nEmergency department source of admission in\u00a071%\u00a0\nIntraabdominal most common source of infection (35%), followed by pneumonia (30%), and UTI (20%)\n\n\n\nIntervention: peripheral perfusion-targeted resuscitation\n\nCapillary refill time was\u00a0was measured every 30 mins, and then hourly after normalization for 8 hours\n\nCRT was measured by applying a glass microscope slide to the right index finger (at the distal phalanx)\u00a0until the finger was blank then maintained for 10 seconds\nThe time to return to normal skin colour was measured using a chronometer\nAbnormal CRT was defined as >3 seconds\nThe goal of resuscitation was to normalise CRT <3 seconds\n\n\n\nControl: lactate level-targeted resuscitation\n\nLactate was measured every 2 hours for 8 hours\n\nThe goal of resuscitation was to normalize or decrease lactate levels by 20% every 2 hours\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nPatients who did not meet the above goals (CRT <3 seconds or lactate fall < 20% every 2 hours) were then managed with the following protocol over the 8 hour period of the study\n\n\nStep 1 \u2013 Fluid responsiveness\n\nPatients were first assessed for fluid responsiveness (most commonly Pulse Pressure Variation or change in Velocity Time Integral post passive leg raising)\n500mls crystalloid bolus was given every 30 mins until goal was achieved, and then stopped if no longer responsive\n\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Vasopressor test\n\nChronic hypertensive patients had a vasopressor test (Target MAP increased to 80-85)\nIf CRT or lactate normalized, MAP was left at 80-85. If no change, then MAP was reduced back to target 65\n\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Inodilator test\n\nIf patients still hadn\u2019t met the target, then a inodilator test was done, where dobutamine or milrinone were introduced\n\n\nAll other aspects were according to surviving sepsis guidelines\n\nOutcomes\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nDay 28 mortality higher in the lactate group: \n\n92 (43.4%) in the lactate group and 74 patients (34.9%) in the peripheral perfusion group\u00a0\nhazard ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.55 to 1.02]; P= .06; risk difference, \u22128.5% [95% CI, \u221218.2% to 1.2%\n\n\n\n\nImpact of the protocol\n\nCompared to the lactate group, the CRT group had:\n\n408 mls less fluid in first 8 hours\u00a0\nless adrenalin use (9.9% vs 16.5% P=0.01)\nlower lactate at 48 hours and 72 hours: \u22120.36 mmol/L [95% CI, \u22120.62 to \u22120.09] vs \u22120.34 mmol/L [95% CI, \u22120.57 to \u22120.10]\nlower CRT levels at 4, 8, 24 hours\n\n\nCVP and central venous saturations did not differ\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nSOFA score: lower at first 72 hours in CRT group: \u22121.00 [95% CI, \u22121.97 to \u22120.02]; P= .045)\nNo other significant differences between group in other secondary outcomes\n\nMechanical ventilation free days at day 28\nRRT free days at day 28\nVasopressor free days at day 28\nICU length of stay\nhospital length of stay\n\n\n\n\nPredefined subgroup analysis\n\nBaseline SOFA score <10 was associated with 28-day mortality HR of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.27 to 0.78), whereas SOFA score of >10 was not significantly different\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong patients with septic shock, a resuscitation strategy targeting normalization of capillary refill time, compared with a strategy targeting serum lactate levels, did not reduce all cause 28-day mortality\n\nStrengths\n\nMultinational, randomized controlled trial, with allocation concealment\nRegistered with ClinicalTrials.gov and pre-published statistical plan\nTime from eligibility to randomisation of 1.4 hours suggesting an early intervention\nRapid recruitment (1 year)\nCRT assessment was standardised (using a chronometer, staff training, auditing, and periodic reinforcement)\nReflects contemporary practices (eg fluid responsiveness)\nGood adherence to the protocol, with no loss to follow-up\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnderpowered to answer the study question\n\nThe sample size was calculated based on an\u00a0ARR of mortality of 15%, which is unrealistic for most resuscitation based sepsis studies\nTherefore although the study resulted in a 8.5% mortality difference, this did not meet the pre-specified significance level (P=0.06)\nThus there was a high chance of a type II (false negative) error\nA formal bayesian analysis would potentially allow a more nuanced interpretation of the trial\n\n\nNon blinding of clinicians may have led to additional changes in management resulting in bias for the intervention\n\nCRT group also required additional staff education while the lactate group did not, again potentially favouring the CRT intervention\n\n\nWhile both arms had CRT assessments every 30 minutes, protocol adjustments were only made every 2 hours for the lactate group\n\nThe reduced frequency of protocol adjustments may have biased the result against the lactate group\n\n\nComplex intervention, making the causal relationship of outcome difficult to explain\n\nThe two arms of the study triggered a complex protocol, of which parts lack a strong evidence base, and which may have biased the results for or against improved outcomes\nFurthermore, parts of the protocol are advanced (fluid responsiveness, vasopressor and inodilator assessments) and\u00a0may not be generalisable to other hospitals\n\n\nThe combination of a lactate based strategy and CRT strategy was not tested\nAlthough the CRT technique was standardised, there has been relatively little literature on this technique, and no evaluation of the inter-rater variability was conducted in the trial\nDay 28 mortality as a primary outcome in sepsis trials has been shown to still be unstable, and most major trials now using day 90\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study suggests the exclusive use of CRT is a possible alternative to lactate as a resuscitation target in sepsis, especially in resource poor settings where lactate measurement is not routinely available\nMy practise is to use a combination of lactate clearance and capillary return, which this study did not address, and therefore it will not change my practice.\nFurther adequately powered studies, with validation of the CRT technique in other settings and countries, will be needed to make CRT my exclusive target for sepsis resuscitation\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Effect of a Resuscitation Strategy Targeting Peripheral Perfusion Status vs Serum Lactate Levels on 28-Day Mortality Among Patients With Septic Shock\nThe ANDROMEDA-SHOCK Randomized Clinical Trial\n[further reading] How Best to Resuscitate Patients With Septic Shock?
