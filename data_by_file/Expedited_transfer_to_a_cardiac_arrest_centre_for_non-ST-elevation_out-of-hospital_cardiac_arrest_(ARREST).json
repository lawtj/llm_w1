Aug 25;S0140-6736(23)01351-X. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(23)01351-X.\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with non-ST elevation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, does expedited delivery of patients to a cardiac arrest centre, compared with delivery to the geographically closest hospital, improve all-cause mortality at 30 days?\n\nBackground\n\nRegional variations have been reported in the survival of patients following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest\nIt is possible that concentrating services within regionalised centres may improve survival through utilising the skills and experience of health-care providers and the infrastructure within those centres\nHowever, previous studies have demonstrated that expedited coronary angiography following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) without ST elevation does not improve survival, and may worsen outcomes\nTherefore, it is unknown whether direct transfer to a cardiac centre in this context will be helpful\n\nDesign\n\nMulticentre, open-label, randomised trial\u00a0\nRandomisation performed by paramedics at dispatch desk using online randomisation system with permuted blocks of 4 or 6 without stratification\nNon-blinded due to the nature of the intervention\nRandomisation was paused twice for 8 months (March to November 2020, and January to August 2021) due to the COVID-19 pandemic\u00a0\nSample size based on local data and pilot study. 430 patients per group would achieve 80% power with a false positive rate of 5%, to detect an absolute risk reduction in 30 day mortality from 60% to 50%, allowing for 10% loss to follow-up\u00a0\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nProspectively registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Registry\n\nSetting\n\nLondon \u2013 35 hospitals in London and the London Ambulance Service\nData collected: January 2018 \u2013 December 2022\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Patients (aged \u226518 years) with return of spontaneous circulation following OHCA\u00a0\nExclusions:\n\nPresumed non-cardiac cause\nPregnancy\nST-elevation myocardial infarction on post-resuscitation 12-lead ECG\nDo-not-attempt-resuscitation order\n\n\nBaseline demographics & prehospital key events (cardiac centre vs nearest ED):\n\nNumber of patients randomised: 431 vs 431\nNumber of patients withdrawn from study post randomisation: 17 vs 18\nAge: 64 vs 63 years\nMale sex: 69% vs 67%\nEthnicity:\n\nWhite: 54% vs 54%\nAsian: 17% vs 17%\nAfro-Caribbean: 5% vs 6%\n\n\nMedical History & CAD risk factors:\n\nDiabetes: 26% vs 24%\nHypertension: 48% vs 51%\nCurrent smoker: 10% vs 13%\nHypercholesterolaemia: 29% vs 26%\nPrevious MI: 15% vs 13%\n\n\nSymptoms preceding cardiac arrest:\n\nChest pain: 24% vs 30%\nDizziness: 9% vs 20%\nBreathlessness: 41% vs 35%\n\n\nWitnessed: 82% vs 80%\nPresenting cardiac rhythm:\n\nAED non-shockable, asystole or PEA: 44% vs 46%\nAED shockable, VF or pulseless VT: 55% vs 55%\n\n\nInitial CPR attempt:\n\nBystander: 70% vs 76%\nLAS: 30% vs 24%\n\n\nAdrenaline administered: 65% vs 63%\nTime from arrest to ROSC (mins): 24 vs 25\u00a0\nTime from arrest to hospital arrival (mins): 84 vs 77\u00a0\nPost ROSC ECG\n\nST elevation: 2% vs 1%\nBundle branch block: 28% vs 24%\nST depression and/or T wave changes: 38% vs 44%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nTransfer to cardiac arrest centre\n\nResuscitated OHCA patients were transported directly to a cardiac arrest centre (CAC) with strategic delivery to the catheter laboratory\nOn arrival patients were assessed by the on-call team (including cardiologist and intensivist teams)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nTransfer to geographically closest Emergency Department\n\nResuscitated OHCA patients were transported to the geographically closest Emergency Department (ED)\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nLAS resuscitation protocols following European and International guidelines\nIn-hospital management was left to physician discretion\u00a0\nBoth groups were required to have delayed neuroprognostication >72 hours\n\nOutcome\n\n\n\nPrimary efficacy endpoint: All-cause mortality at 30 days was not statistically different between groups\n\n63% vs 63% (RR 1.00;

95% CI 1.00 to 2\u00b741\n\n\nSubgroup analysis based on age:\u00a0\n\n<57 years associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality by 30 days in the CAC group (RR 0\u00b776, 95% CI 0\u00b760\u20130\u00b797)\n57-71 years associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality by 30 days in the CAC group (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.56)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtocol deviations and Crossover:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19 protocol deviations were recorded, including:\n\n3 cross-overs (1 randomised to ED taken to CAC, 2 randomised to CAC taken to ED)\n10 patients did not meet the eligibility criteria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCause of arrest:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCardiac: 62.8% vs 59.3%\nNon-cardiac: 20.8% vs 19.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInpatient interventions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoronary angiogram performed: 56.1% vs 37.3%\nArrest to coronary angiography (hours): 2.3 vs 5.7\nOrgan support:\n\nAdmitted to ICU: 80% vs 69%\nVentilatory: 85.7% vs 76.1%\nRenal: 11.2% vs 8.4%\nHaemodynamic support: 72.1% vs 62.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\u201cWe show no difference in the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality at 30 days in patients with resuscitated cardiac arrest without ST elevation in the community who were delivered to a cardiac arrest centre compared with those who were delivered to the geographically closest emergency department.\u201d\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti-centre, randomised, controlled trial\nCentral randomisation with permuted blocks ensured allocation concealment\nBaseline demographics were well matched between groups including age, presence of CAD risk factors, witnessed arrest, presenting rhythm, time to defibrillation and distribution of coronary disease\nIntention to treat analysis, few protocol deviations and crossover, and minimal attrition enhances internal validity\nBroad inclusion criteria with few exclusions enhances external validity\nPatient-centered primary outcome with potentially significant strategic planning implications\nRemarkable execution of a complex intervention, which is the first of its kind in randomising resuscitated OHCA without ST elevation to specific centres\nAn important development that challenges resource intensive recommendations from multiple professional bodies in the absence of randomised data, and a reminder that observational data is prone to confounders\nThe null result of this study and secondary outcome of less favourable neurological outcomes in survivors at 3 months in the CAC group is a logical continuation of the TOMAHAWK study, and lends further weight to the hypothesis that the priority for resuscitated OHCA without ST elevation is immediate stabilisation on ICU, rather than early coronary intervention\n\nLimitations\n\nOpen-label nature of the study could introduce bias although not obviously in any one direction\nThe hypothesis from observational data that patients with absence of ROSC before hospital admission, or those with ROSC associated with ST-elevation myocardial infarction may benefit from transfer to a CAC, was not tested in this study\nIt is possible that the result of this trial overlooks subgroups that could benefit from the intervention; in particular a benefit is implied for younger people and this is acknowledged by the authors. As there is plausibility in terms of reversibility potential and increased physiological reserve, this could be considered hypothesis generating\u00a0\nExternal validity is limited by the setting of this study in a densely populated, relatively small urban area. Whether this will generalise to non-urban areas with greater geographical spread is not known, although one might hypothesise that as the difference in transit times is likely to be higher, transfer to a CAC may worsen outcomes in this setting\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis well executed study does not support the prehospital transfer of all patients to a cardiac arrest centre following resuscitated cardiac arrest without ST elevation\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Expedited transfer to a cardiac arrest centre for non-ST-elevation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (ARREST): a UK prospective, multicentre, parallel, randomised clinical trial\nfurther reading JC: The ARREST trial.
