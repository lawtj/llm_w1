Intensive Care Medicine. 2020. DOI: 10.1007/s00134-020-06216-x\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients aged > 18 years who were unable to be liberated from vasopressors for 24 hours, did the addition of midodrine when compared to a placebo result in the earlier discontinuation of vasopressors?\n\nBackground\n\nMidodrine is an oral alpha-1 adrenergic agonist licensed to treat orthostatic hypotension\nIt has been used in ICU off-label in order to try and liberate patients from vasopressors\nThey have been no randomised clinical trials studying the use of midodrine in this setting\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial\nRandomised in 1:1 ratio using computer generated sequence stratified by site\n\nList provided directly to compounding pharmacy\n\n\nPower calculations required 50 patients in each arm to detect a 6 hour difference in time to vasopressor discontinuation (two sided alpha of 0.05, power 80%)\n\nPower calculations based on a study that involved 20 surgical patients looking at the rate of decline of IV phenylephrine (or phenylephrine equivalent) administration following midodrine use\n\n\nAnalysis performed using modified intention to treat approach\n\nAll those who included one dose of the drug were analysed\n\n\nWritten consent provided for all participants\nApproved by local boards at each site and registered with US FDA and Australian TGA\n\nSetting\n\n3 tertiary referral centres:\n\n2 in Boston, USA and 1 in Perth, Australia\n\n\nData collected from October 2012 \u2013 June 2019\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAged > 18 years\nSingle agent vasopressor at time of randomisation\n\nDoses had to be < 100 mcg/min phenylephrine, < 8 mcg /min norepinephrine or < 60 mcg/min metaraminol\nIf multiple vasopressors and/or doses greater than those listed had been used, patients were still eligible as long as criteria above met at time of randomisation\n\n\nPatients had to be resuscitated and reversible causes of hypotension treated\nUnable to be liberated from vasopressors for > 24 hours\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nClinical evidence of inadequate tissue oxygenation\nHypovolaemic shock\nHypotension due to adrenal insufficiency, liver failure, chronic renal failure or severe cardiac failure (LVEF < 30%), acute urinary retention, pheochromocytoma, thryotoxicosis, bradycardia (HR < 50)\nPregnancy\nReceived midodrine prior to enrollment or known allergy to midodrine\nInability to receive enteral medications\nEnrolled in another trial\n\n\n136 patients randomised\n\n530 assessed, 213 eligible\n\n317 excluded (193 did not meet inclusion criteria, 124 met exclusion criteria)\n\n\n68 randomised in each arm\n66 analysed in each arm\n\n2 patients in each arm had no vasopressor requirement prior to drug administration so did not receive any midodrine / placebo\n\n\n\n\nBaseline characteristics similar, comparing midodrine vs. placebo group\n\nMale: 55% vs. 9%\nAge 70 vs. 67\nWhite/Caucasian: 97% vs. 94%\nAPACHE II score: 14.7 vs. 14.8\nIndication for ICU admission\n\nPost-op/surgical: 68% vs. 64%\nSepsis: 20% vs. 20%\nMedical/other: 12% vs. 17%\n\n\nEpidural analgesia: 27% vs. 20%\nDuration of vasopressor administration before study drug administration: 35.5 vs. 35.4 hours\nBaseline MAP: 76 vs. 73mmHg\nVasopressor dose at enrollment (mcg/kg/min)\n\nNorepinephrine (n=41): 0.06 vs. 0.06\nPhenylephrine (n=28): 0.61 vs. 0.43\nMetaraminol (n=60): 0.6 vs. 0.61\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nMidodrine\n\n20 mg oral\nAdministered 8 hourly\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\nMatched in appearance\nAdministered orally 8 hourly\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nDrugs administered until:\n\nICU discharge\nBP goal met for > 24 hours without vasopressors (trial drug could then be ceased at discretion of treating clinicians)\nWorsening hypotension requiring high dose vasopressors\nRequirement for adrenaline\nSigns and symptoms of organ dysfunction, or hypo-perfusion\nAdverse events related to midodrine\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nMedian time from study drug initiation until discontinuation of IV vasopressors \u2013 no significant difference\n\n23.5 hours (IQR 10 \u2013 54 hours) in midodrine group vs. 22.5 hours (IQR 10.4 \u2013 40 hours) in placebo\nDifference 1 hour (95% C.I. -10.4 to 12.3, p=0.62)\n\n\nDiscontinuation defined as a vasopressor free period of 24 hours\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nNo statistical difference in time to readiness for ICU discharge, ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS and ICU readmission\n\n\nPost-Hoc Subgroup Analyses for primary outcome \u2013 time to vasopressor discontinuation\n\nIn patients with epidural analgesia \u2013 significantly reduced in midodrine vs. placebo group\n\nDifference -18.4 hours (95% C.I. -33.5 to -3.3, p=0.045)\n\n\nIn patients without epidural analgesia \u2013 no significant difference\n\nDifference 9.7 hours (95% C.I. -6.3 to 25.7, p=0.1)\n\n\nNo differences found based on the following subgroups: ICU admission reason or opioid usage\n\nOpioid usage analysed to address possibility of impaired GI absorption\n\n\n\n\nAdverse Events:\n\nBradycardia significantly more common in midodrine group\n\n8% vs. 0%, p=0.02\nBradycardia defined as HR < 40, or decrease in HR > 20% from specified goal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe use of midodrine did not result in earlier liberation from vasopressors in critically ill adults when compared to a placebo\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised, double blind and placebo controlled increases internal validity\nMulti-site and international\nThe inclusion criteria of a low dose, single vasopressor usage seems sensible given the postulation that the administration of midodrine may help in those patients with a stubborn, low dose vasopressor requirement\nInclusion criteria broad which means applicable to a wide range of ICU patients\n\nHowever as the authors allude (especially given the small sample size) this might mean the sample population is too heterogeneous to show effect\nThis may be highlighted by the results of those with epidural analgesia\n\nThey authors rightly don\u2019t draw any inference from this under-powered, post-hoc sub group analyses but suggest this finding is hypothesis generating\n\n\n\n\nSensible inclusion of safety outcomes in analysis\nNo data for analysis of primary outcome was missing\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe dosing requirements for inclusion didn\u2019t specify a weight based dose\n\n8mcg / min norepinephrine in a 45kg patient equates to 0.18mcg/kg/min compared to 0.06mcg/kg/min in a 120kg patient\n\n\nWhen reviewing the supplementary material:\n\nBaseline MAP for the midodrine group was 75.9 mmHg and for the placebo group was 72.8 mmHg\n\n24 hours following study drug initiation these had only increased by 1.3 mmHg (midodrine group) and 1.5 mmHg (placebo group)\nBaseline MAP seems higher than one would conventionally target when patient remains on a small vasopressor dose. Could discontinuation have occurred by altering the MAP target (ie. to 65mmHg) without the need for midodrine?\n\n\nMean fluid balance 100 mls higher in midodrine group than placebo on day 1 of study drug (+927 mls vs +826mls)\n\nNo further details surrounding fluid management is given\n\n\n\n\nDespite being multi-site and international, there were only three sites from two countries, both of which are high income countries which may minimise external validity\n\n64% (n = 85) of patients were randomised from the Australian site\n\n\nSmall sample size\n\n66 % (n = 87) post-operative / surgical\n\nDoes a post operative vasoplegic state resolve differently to other vasoplegic / vasodilatory states?\n\n\n\n\nThere is no data provided as to the requirement of other organ supports for these patients\n\nIf a patient\u2019s vasopressors are ceased earlier but they remain intubated then the outcome of faster vasopressor cessation is probably not clinically relevant\n\n\nWhy did recruitment take so long (7 years) in a multi centre trial when the main inclusion criteria was requirement > 24 hours of\u00a0 low dose vasopressors?\n\nThis suggests there may have been a selection bias\nAdditionally, the exclusion of patients already receiving midodrine (n=24) may also lead to a selection bias\n\n\nSubgroup analyses not pre-specified\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis RCT in patients with an ongoing need for low dose vasopressors, reported that the use of midodrine compared with placebo, did not result in any significant reduction in the time to the discontinuation of IV vasopressors\nI will not be using midodrine to help liberate patients from vasopressors, especially with increased rate of bradycardic events\nAlthough \u201cnon-significant\u201d, this trial is important in advancing clinical care given the limited prior evidence on the use of midodrine in this manner.\n\nExternal Links\n\n\n\nPulmCrit \u2013 Oral vasopressor to accelerate liberation from the ICU\u00a0\nDrugBank \u2013 Midodrine\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker @hgmwalker89\nSummary date: 9th September 2020\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\n\n\n"
