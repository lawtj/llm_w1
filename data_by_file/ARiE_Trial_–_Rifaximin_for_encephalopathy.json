Am J Gastroenterol 2024; doi: 10.14309/ajg.0000000000002575\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill adults with overt acute hepatic encephalopathy (HE) admitted to ICU, does the addition of rifaximin to broad spectrum antimicrobials affect time to resolution of HE?\n\nBackground\n\nRifaximin is an orally administered broad-spectrum antimicrobial which is not absorbed systemically. It reduces local ammonia production in the gut and therefore reduces systemic ammonia absorption\nIt is known that rifaximin reduces the risk of recurrence of overt acute HE in patients with cirrhosis when used in addition to a non-absorbable dissacharide (such as lactulose)\nA recent meta-analysis suggests rifaximin may decrease mortality and duration of acute HE when used with lactulose, but with low-certainty of evidence (Zacharias et al, 2023)\nIt is unclear if rifaximin improves time to resolution of acute HE, particularly when broad spectrum antimicrobials are already being administered\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, parallel group trial\nComputer generated randomisation in 1:1 ratio\nConcealment via sequentially numbered sealed envelopes\nAuthors describe a non-inferiority trial in parts of the discussion but trial methodology does not support this\nSample size calculation based on a power of 90%, an alpha error of 5% and margin of 15% for resolution of HE\nIntention to treat and per-protocol analysis carried out\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre study from Hyderabad, India\nParticipants recruited between 28th February 2022 and 3rd April 2023\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdults aged 18-75 with overt HE (West Haven score of 2 or greater) admitted to ICU with a background of cirrhosis\n\nCirrhosis was defined by a clinical history of decompensation (ascites, HE or variceal bleeding) with supportive imaging or biopsy findings\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nAcute liver failure (jaundice to encephalopathy <4 weeks)\nUrea on presentation >150mg/dl (8.3 mmol/l)\nUnderlying chronic renal failure (eGFR <60 for >3 months)\nHepatocellular carcinoma\nHistory of alcohol consumption within 1 week\nDeath within 24 hours of admission (before randomisation)\n\n\n260 patients assessed for eligibility, 184 randomised\n\n76 excluded consistent with criteria above\nNo loss to follow-up\nCrossover in 5 patients (3 discontinued rifaximin, 2 commenced)\n\n\nNo major difference in baseline characteristics \u2013\n\n\n\nComparing antibiotics only group to rifaximin + antibiotics:\n\nAge 48 vs 47 years\nSex 88% vs 89% male\nEtiology primarily alcohol (64% vs 68%) followed by NASH (14% vs 17%) and viral (10% vs 7%)\nAKI on presentation in 61% vs 50%\n\nLOLA used in 41% vs 50% (noting above)\n\n\nACLF criteria met in 50% vs 54%\nSOFA 8.9 vs 8.8, MELD 29.6 vs 29.1\n32% vs 28% were mechanically ventilated\n45% vs 40% were diagnosed with infection\nAntimicrobials \u2013\n\nCarbapenems 36% vs 40%\nCephalosporin/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors 39% vs 34%\nPenicillin/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor 16% vs 21%\n\n\nNote grade of encephalopathy \u2013 higher percentage of low-grade (II) encephalopathy in antimicrobial only group\n\nII 29% vs 20%\nIII 60% vs 70%\nIV 11% vs 9%\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nRifaximin and broad spectrum antibiotics\n\nRifaximin\n\n550mg twice daily orally or via NG\n\n\nBroad spectrum antimicrobials\n\ncarbapenems, cephalosporin/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, penicillin/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, glycopeptides, fluroquinolones and macrolides were considered broad-spectrum\n\n\nLength of course not specified\n\n\n\nControl\n\nBroad-spectrum antibiotics (as above)\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAuthors report all patients received lactulose either enterally or via enema titrated to stool frequency (2-3/day)\n\n\n\n\nTotal doses not reported\n\n\n\n\nTreatment of underlying precipitant for HE was instigated as per hospital policy (e.g. protocolised septic screen, terlipressin and albumin for AKI, screening for intracerebral pathology)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nTwo grade reduction and/or complete resolution in HE:\n46.7% (95% CI 33.8-63) in intervention vs 44.6% (95% CI 32-70) P = 0.84 over 4.1 vs 3.6 days P=0.27 \u2013 no significant difference\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nComparing antimicrobials + rifaximin vs. antimicrobials only,\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nIn-hospital mortality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% (CI 37-67) vs 62% (CI 47-80) HR 0.7; P = 0.06\n\n\nDuration of hospital stay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 days vs 9 days, P =0.18\n\n\nIncidence of nosocomial infection\n\n13% vs 6.5% P=0.21\n\n\nChange in endotoxin level\n\n-0.01 EU/ml vs +0.08EU/ml P= 0.64\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubgroup analysis\n\nIn patients with decompensated cirrhosis (n=88), there was a statistically significant improvement in mortality (56.5% vs 33.3% P=0.003) in patients given rifaximin + antimicrobials, compared with antimicrobials along (a significant difference in nosocomial infections was noted between these groups)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe addition of rifaximin to broad-spectrum antimicrobials does not result in early HE resolution in critically ill patients with cirrhosis and does not reduce the incidence of infection or endotoxin levels.\nIn patients with decompensated cirrhosis rifaximin may reduce in-hospital mortality and rates of nosocomial infection, while in ACLF patients rifaximin has no effect\n\nStrengths\n\nThe study authors ask a pragmatic question \u2013 is rifaximin required in HE when already on broad-spectrum antimicrobials?\nPerformed in population of interest to critical care physicians, significant numbers of patients requiring mechanical ventilation with high SOFA scores\nBoth groups reportedly received lactulose, an already established treatment\nThe aetiology of underlying liver disease was primarily alcohol, and to a lesser extent non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, similar to many developed nations\nAuthors were careful to protocolise and describe infection screens and analysis of infective causes and describe a rigorous approach to diagnostic work-up of patients with HE\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle centre\n\n\n\n\nUse of broad-spectrum antimicrobials will vary significantly from nations with lower rates of antimicrobial resistance, and empiric use of these agents outside of variceal bleeding is not established practice as conducted in this trial\n\n\n\n\nNo placebo group introduces a significant risk of bias\nThe authors state they chose a non-inferiority trial design in the discussion but trial methodology, sample size/ power calculation and statistical analysis reporting does not clearly support this\nHE assessed only once/ 24 hours could underestimate between group differences, missing a true difference in HE resolution times\nTrial participants without AKI also received l-Ornithine l-Aspartate (LOLA), another theorised treatment for HE (50% in the rifaximin group vs 41% in the control group) \u2013 potential confounder\nThe ACLF subgroup analysis seems to indicate no statistical difference between the intervention group on mortality, but of note the ACLF intervention group appeared to have higher grades of encephalopathy and higher MELD and SOFA scores. In addition the improvement in mortality in decompensated cirrhosis groups was attributed to fewer nosocomial infections however with little physiological basis for how rifaximin would result in this\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI will continue to use lactulose as my current standard treatment for HE in critically ill patients\nWhere lactulose is not tolerated or HE is refractory to this therapy, I consider rifaximin as a relatively safe adjunct therapy that may improve HE resolution and recurrence, particularly in those with decompensated cirrhosis\n\n\u00a0\nExternal Links\n\narticle\u00a0(Kulkarni et al, 2024)\nfurther reading\u00a0(Zacharias et al, 2023)\n\nSummary author: Christopher Smith @ChrisCritCare\nPeer review editor: Aniket Nadkarni; @AniketNadkarni1\nImage by dtiner76 from Pixabay\n\n\n"
