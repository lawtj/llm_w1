Interventional Cardiology; 18:e29. doi.org/10.15420/icr.2023.08\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA), how does the MIRACLE2 score compare with previously reporting scoring systems, for predicting poor neurological outcome at hospital discharge?\n\nBackground\n\nOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest has an ~8% survival to hospital discharge\nIn those patients admitted to intensive care following an OOHCA ~50% survive, with the leading cause of death being hypoxic brain injury\nCurrent guidelines recommend prognostication after 72 hours following a cardiac arrest\nThe MIRACLE2 score was developed to provide early prediction of neurological outcomes\nThis study aimed to externally validate the MIRACLE2 score and compare it with other scoring systems\n\nDesign\n\nRetrospective cohort study\nSingle centre\nAll admissions screened for cardiac arrest ICD-10 codes\nRecords were then manually reviewed\nNo sample size calculation\n\nSetting\n\nSingle tertiary cardiac centre, UK, with 24 hour access to coronary angiography cardiac surgery and specialist intensive care services\nDates of data collection: January 2019 \u2013 July 202\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdult patients\nOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac origin who had return of spontaneous circulation\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nDied before hospital arrival\nEvidence of non-cardiac cause of arrest (respiratory arrest, suicide, trauma, drowning, substance overdose)\nConfirmed intra-cerebral haemorrhage\nBaseline neurological disability with Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 3 or 4\nCo-morbidity leading to life expectancy <6 months\n\n\nData from 682 patients analysed\n\nExclusions\n\nDid not relate to new presentation of OHCA (n=321)\nObvious non-cardiac cause for arrest (n=40)\nDead on arrival (n=2)\nPaediatric (n=33)\nLife expectancy <6 months or significant prior neurological disability (n=11)\nDid not initially present to study centre ie. transferred in (n=28)\nNo medical information available (n=35)\n\n\nAfter exclusions 219 patients included in validation cohort\nComplete data for calculating MIRACLE2 score available for 77% of patients. Missing data for pupillary response in 18% and initial pH in 6%\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of patients that had good (CPC 0-2) and poor neurological outcome (CPC 3-5) at hospital discharge\n\nAge: 60 vs. 71\nMale: 83% vs. 70%\nhs-cT (ng/l): 173 vs. 264\nST elevation: 39% vs. 23%\nLV EF: 50% vs. 45%\nWitnessed arrest: 88% vs. 81%\nZero-flow time (min), median (range): 0 (0-7.5) vs. 0 (0-20)\nLow-flow time (min), median (range): 17 (9-26) vs. 32 (20-45)\nShockable rhythm: 96% vs. 57%\nChanging rhythms: 11% vs. 55%\nAny adrenaline dose: 32% vs. 92%\nInitial pH: 7.20 vs. 7.26\nReactive pupils: 94% vs. 64\nLactate 3.9 vs. 6.1mmol/l\nGCS motor score of 1: 57% vs. 93%\n\n\n\nTest of Interest\n\nMIRACLE2 score \u2013 7 variables with maximum score of 10 points\n\nUnwitnessed cardiac arrest (1 point)\nNon-shockable initial rhythm (1point)\nChanging rhythm (any 2 of VF, PEA, or asytole): 1 point\nAny adrenaline dose: 2 points\nNo pupil reactivity at ROSC: 1 point\nInitial blood pH <7.2: 1 point\nAge\n\n\u226460 years: 0 points\n61-80 years: 1 point\n>80 years: 2 points (in this paper it states that age >80 years gives a score of 2 points. This may be an error as the maximum total score would be 9 if given 2 points for age >80; and in the original derivation study age >80 was given a score of 3 points.)\n\n\n\n\n\nControl Tests\n\nCardiac Arrest Hospital Prognosis (CAHP) score\nOut-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) score\nTarget Temperature Management (TTM) score\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: poor neurological recovery, defined as CPC 3-5 (severe disability to death) at hospital discharge\nArea under receiver operating curve for predicting poor neurological outcome at discharge\n\nMIRACLE 2: 0.93\nCAHP: 0.92\nOHCA: 0.83\nTTM: 0.94\n\n\nGood vs poor neurological outcome\n\nLow MIRACLE 2 score: \u22642, (n=89): 94% vs 6%\nIntermediate MIRACLE 2 score: 3-4 (n=66): 53% vs 47%\nHigh MIRACLE 2 score: \u22655 (n=64): 5% vs 95%\n\n\nMIRACLE2 score \u22655 predicted poor neurological outcome with a\n\nSpecificity 97.5% (95% CI 93-99.5%)\nSensitivity 62.3%\n+ve Likelihood Ratio 25.6 (95% CI 8.3-79)\n-ve Likelihood Raio 0.38\n\n\nMIRACLE2 score \u22653 predicted poor neurological outcome with a\n\nSpecificity 68.9%\nSensitivity 94.9% (95% CI 88.4-98.3%)\n+ve Likelihood Ratio 3.05\n-ve Likelihood Ratio 0.07 (95% CI 0.03-0.18)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nArea under curve for predicting poor neurological outcome at 6 months\n\nMIRACLE 2: 0.93\nCAHP: 0.92\nOHCA: 0.86\nTTM: 0.94\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\u201cThe MIRACLE2 score demonstrates good prognostic performance and is easily applicable to cardiac-origin OHCA presentation at the hospital front door. Prognostic scoring may assist decision-making regarding early angiographic assessment.\u201d\n\nStrengths\n\nScreening of all admissions\nCompared with 3 other scoring systems\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOnly 64 patients included with MIRACLE2 score \u22655\nSingle centre\nRetrospective\nNumber of patients had missing data\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe MIRACLE2 score reported high accuracy for determining neurological prognostication at admission. However due to this being a single centre retrospective validation cohort with only small numbers of patients that had a high MIRACLE 2 score,\u00a0 and >20% of patients having missing data, decisions regarding treatment or escalation should not currently be made solely on the MIRACLE 2 score at admission\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Validation of the MIRACLE2 Score for Prognostication After Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest\nfurther reading https://rebelem.com/miracle2-risk-score-for-early-prediction-of-neurologic-outcome-in-out-of-hospital-cardiac-arrest/\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 11/03/24\nPeer-review editor: Jonarthan Thevanayagam\nPhoto by Milad Fakurian on Unsplash\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
