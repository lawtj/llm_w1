https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02490-9\nClinical Question\n\nIn selected patients undergoing cardiac surgery, does posterior left pericardiotomy compared with usual care, reduce the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation?\n\nBackground\n\nAtrial fibrillation is common following cardiac surgery with approximately one-third of patients developing new atrial fibrillation in the immediate postoperative period\nPericardial effusion is common following cardiac surgery with approximately two-thirds of patients having evidence of effusion on echocardiography\nPericardial effusion can cause inflammatory changes in the myocardium which can result in atrial arrhythmias\nPosterior left pericardiotomy allows drainage of the pericardial space into the left pleural space, reducing postoperative pericardial effusions\nPrevious small studies, with poor and inconsistent methodology, have suggested pericardiotomy reduces the incidence of atrial fibrillation\nThis trial aimed to provide quality evidence to guide operative management in these at risk patients\n\nDesign\n\nSingle centre, RCT\n1:1 randomisation stratified by CHA2DS2-VASc score\u00a0\nVariable block randomisation with computer generated allocation to group\nBlinding of patient and assessor\nSurgical team were made aware of the allocation the night prior to surgery\nIntention to treat analysis\nA priori publication of study protocol\nLogistic regression analysis took into account the operating surgeon and other variables such as age, sex, diabetes, LVEF, extent of coronary disease, chronic lung disease, perioperative beta-blocker use\nSample size of 350 patients initially calculated to provide 90% power to detect a 50% reduction in primary outcome, based on previous literature and accounting for protocol violations/study dropout (presuming primary outcome incidence of 30%)\nSample size increased to 420 after second interim analysis, due to lower than anticipated incidence in primary outcome\n\nSetting\n\nPatients treated at the New York Presbyterian Hospital, NY, USA\nTrial recruitment September 2017 to August 2021\nProtocol amendment in March 2020 to allow recruitment during COVID-19 pandemic\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdults undergoing cardiac surgery\nCardiac surgery included coronary surgery, aortic valve surgery or aortic surgery (or a combination of these)\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nPrevious history of atrial fibrillation or arrhythmias\nPatients having mitral or tricuspid valve surgery\nPatients with disease of the left pleura precluding the intervention\nRepeat sternotomies or minimally invasive procedures\n\n\n3601 patients were screened and 420 included\n212 were assigned to the left posterior pericardiotomy group and 208 to the no intervention group\nMedian age was 61 years\n76% were male\nThere was good baseline balance between groups\n\nIntervention\n\nA 4-5 cm vertical incision posterior to the phrenic nerve and extending from the left inferior pulmonary vein to the diaphragm\n212 patients\n3 patients in this group did not receive the intervention\n\nControl\n\nNo intervention\n208 patients\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nContinuous cardiac rhythm monitoring for the entire postoperative in-hospital stay.\nDaily ECG\nIn person or telephone interview at day 30 post discharge\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: the occurrence of in-hospital postoperative atrial fibrillation during the entire in-hospital stay (defined as AF for more than 30 seconds on monitor)\n\nIntervention vs Control:Intention to treat analysis, post-operative atrial fibrillation significantly less in the intervention group 17% vs 32% (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27-0.70, p=0.0005)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: Intervention vs Control\n\nTime spent in atrial fibrillation 1262 hours vs 2277 hours\nNeed for anti-arrhythmic medications 17% vs 31%\nNeed for anticoagulation 6% vs 14%\nDuration of post-operative in-hospital stay 5 vs 5 days\nWhen limiting the analysis to patients who had received perioperative beta-blockers (92% of total) there was still a difference between groups, with 11% vs 26% having atrial fibrillation.\n\n\nSafety Outcomes: Intervention vs Control\n\nPost-operative mortality 2 vs 1 patients\nPericardial effusion (as assessed on echocardiography) significantly less in intervention group: 12% vs 21% (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.91)\nPostoperative major events, eg stroke, myocardial infarct 3% vs 2%\nLeft pleural effusion 30% vs 32%\nSurgery time: 306 vs 289 minutes\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nPerforming left posterior pericardiotomy at the time of cardiac surgery significantly reduces the incidence of post-operative atrial fibrillation\nThe intervention appears safe without adverse effects\n\nStrengths\n\nAn important question with a clinically meaningful outcome\nAllocation concealment, intention to treat analysis, complete follow-up\nExclusion of patients having mitral and tricuspid valve surgery as the pathogenesis of AF in these patients is less likely due to pericardial effusion and inflammation.\nThe intervention is low cost and adds very little extra time to surgery\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle centre study: tend to provide larger treatment effects than multicentre trials\nThere is no information as to whether this intervention is superior to other preventative methods for AF, eg colchicine.\nA small study likely underpowered to detect differences in hospital length of stay, mortality and other rare events\nA large bias towards white males (>70%)\nNearly 80% of the operations were performed by a single surgeon, significantly limiting external validity\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis simple intervention seems to be a safe surgical technique to reduce post-cardiac surgery atrial fibrillation\nMulticentre trials would evaluate the external validity of this result\n\nExternal
