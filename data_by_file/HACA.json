N Engl J Med 2000; 346:549-556\nClinical Question\n\nIn adults who suffer cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, does mild hypothermia compared with standard normothermia improve neurological outcome at 6 months?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\nBlinded assessment of the outcome\nComputer generated \u2018sealed envelope\u2019 randomisation in blocks of 10, stratified by medical centre\n\nSetting\n\n\nNine centres in five European countries\nMarch 1996 to January 2001\nStopped before full recruitment due to lower than expected enrollment rate and funding shortage\n\n\nPopulation\n\n\nInclusion: 18 \u2013 75 year olds; witnessed cardiac arrest; pulseless VT or VF as initial rhythm.\nExclusion: longer than 15 minutes before advanced life support; longer than 60 minutes before ROSC; responsive after ROSC; prolonged hypotension after ROSC (30 minutes at MAP < 60 mmHg); hypoxaemia for more than 15 minutes after ROSC; cardiac arrest after medical support already present\n3551 assessed of which 275 randomised\n\n\nIntervention\n\n\n137 patients\nInduced hypothermia targeting 32\u201334\u00b0C using surface cooling (cold air blanket or ice packs) for 24 hours, followed by passive re-warming\nSedation and shiver-management was protocolised: midazolam, fentanyl and pancuronium\n\nMedian time from ROSC to initiation of cooling was 105 minutes [IQR 61\u2013192]\nMedian time from ROSC to target temperature was 8 hours [IQR 4\u201316]\n12% failed to reach target temperature\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\n\n128 patients\nStandard hospital bed with no temperature management\nSedation protocol as per intervention arm\n\nDiagrammatic data suggests median temperature was 37.5\u00b0C or higher from ~12 hours onward\n\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\n\nPrimary outcome: more patients in the hypothermia group were left with good neurological outcomes at six months\n\n\nGood neurological outcome assessed as Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories 1 [no disability] or 2 [mild disability]\nBad neurological outcome assessed as P-CPC 3 [severe disability], 4 [persistent vegetative state] or 5 [death]\n\n75 (55%) versus 54 (39%) had favourable neurological outcomes, favouring hypothermia\nRisk ratio for death in normothermia group was 1.40 (95% CI 1.08\u20131.81).\nNumber-needed-to-treat was 6 (95% CI 4\u201325)\nSecondary outcome: a difference in mortality favoured the hypothermia group\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\nAmong patients in whom spontaneous circulation has been restored after cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, systemic cooling to a bladder temperature of 32\u201334\u00b0C for 24 hours increases the chance of a favourable neurological outcome, as compared to standard normothermic life support\n\n\nStrengths\n\n\nRandomised trial with blinded assessment.\nFirst clinical trial testing theory drawn from cohort and animal studies.\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\n\nNarrow inclusion criteria limit generalisability\nMinor baseline differences between groups, but no change in risk ratio after statistical correction\nAttending physician not blinded, which may bias toward a positive outcome\nBlinding of assessing physician not verified, but relatively objective outcome assessment should limit impact of any accidental un-blinding\nOnly 8% of screened patients were included; selection bias cannot be excluded\nControl group became hyperthermic, which may be harmful. Difference observed could be due to harm of conventional therapy rather than benefit of hypothermic therapy\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\nIn patients who suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to VT or VF, and where resuscitation efforts are quickly commenced, and when ROSC has been achieved within 1 hour, therapeutic hypothermia targeting 32\u201334\u00b0C will improve the chance of a favourable outcome and should be implemented. The results of this trial now need to be reviewed in light of TTM.\n\n\n\n\nLinks\nFull text pdf / abstract / doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa012689\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\n\nSafar: Therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest.
