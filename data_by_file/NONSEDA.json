DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1906759\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients, does a strategy of no sedation, as compared with light sedation with daily sedation breaks, impact day 90 mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nSedation during mechanical ventilation improves patient comfort and may help with ventilator synchronisation\nHowever prolonged and deep sedation has significant side effects, including increased duration of mechanical ventilation, impaired neuromuscular function and delirium (Guerin editorial NEJM 2020)\nSeveral major trials (Kress et al NEJM 2000, Girard et al Lancet 2008) demonstrated that reducing the amount sedation during mechanical ventilation improved outcomes, although the optimal \u201cdose\u201d is not clear\nA single center RCT by the same authors of this\u00a0study (Strom et al Lancet 2010) suggested that no sedation, as compared to light sedation with daily interruption of sedation, was associated with more days free of mechanical ventilation (13 vs 9 p=0.019) and shorter stay in the ICU (13 vs 22 p=0.031)\nThe following multicentre trial investigated whether a strategy of no sedation compared to one of light sedation (with daily interruption of sedation), would impact day 90 mortality\n\nDesign\n\nInvestigator-initiated, randomised, clinical, parallel-group, multinational, superiority trial \nPatients randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio using a computer generated assignment sequence with a variable block size\nStratification by participating center, age \u226465 yo or >65 and the presence of absence of shock (<70mmHg or \u226570mmHg)\nNo blinding of investigators, patients or relatives\nPre published statistical plan with an intention to treat analysis\nNo provision for correcting for multiple comparisons of secondary outcomes\nNo industry funding\nSample Size\n\nCalculated from the groups previous study where mortality in the no sedation group was 36%, and in the light sedation 47% (Risk reduction 25%)\nAssuming a relative risk reduction of 25%, an alpha score of 5%, and beta score of 20%, the sample size to provide 80% power is 700 patients\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n8 Scandinavian ICUs (5 Denmark, 2 Norway, 1 Sweden)\n1:1 nursing-patient ratios in most of the participating ICUs\nJanuary 2014 to November 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: \u226518 years old, intubated <24hours prior and expected to be ventilated \u226524hours\nExclusion:\u00a0Severe head trauma, therapeutic hypothermia, status epilepticus or had participated in the previous trial, transferred from another ICU with a length of stay \u226548 hours, were comatose on admission, were brain dead, or had a partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen of \u22649 kPa, or if sedation was anticipated to be necessary for oxygenation or proning.\n2300 patients were screened\n710 enrolled in trial (336 declined)\n354 in the no sedation group and 356 in light sedation\n10 patients excluded leaving 700 in modified ITT analysis.\nNo loss to follow-up\nMean age was 71 years old\nMedian APACHE score 25.5\n68% medical admissions\nPneumonia/ARDS most common cause (42%)\nThe two groups were similar at baseline except APACHE II was 1 point higher in the non sedation group\n\nIntervention\n\nNo sedation\n\nPatients received no routine sedation\nBolus doses of morphine for analgesia\nSedation (ie cross over) could be given after both non pharmocological (reassurance or mobilisation) and pharmacological (analgesia) were given, but was discouraged\n\n\n\nControl\n\nLight sedation\n\nPatients received continuous sedation aiming for RASS (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale) of -2 to -3\nPropofol for first 48hours, then swapped to midazolam\nDaily sedation breaks each morning aiming to get to full wakefulness\nSedation was\n\nWeaned to half dose if able to complete simple commands\nNot resumed if PEEP \u22645cmH20 and FiO2 \u226440\nResumed if patient not comfortable during wake up period\n\n\nAnxiety or withdrawal was treated with clonidine\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAnalgesia (ie paracetamol and morphine bolus) given as required\nCAM ICU delirium screen done at least twice daily\n\nTreatment started with non pharmacological means, then haloperidol or olanzapine\n\n\nProphylactic low molecular weight heparin\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome 90 day mortality \u2013 no significant difference\n\nNo sedation vs light sedation 148 (42.4%) vs 130 (37.0%) (5.4 percentage points; 95% CI \u22122.2 to 12.2; P = 0.65)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\nComparing\u00a0no sedation vs light sedation patients:\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nDays until death: 13 vs 12\nMechanical ventilation free days in 1st 28 days: 20 vs 19\nICU days: 13 vs 14\nDays free from coma or delirium: 27 vs 26\nHighest RIFLE score: 2 vs 2\nAccidental extubation requiring reintubation within 1 hour\u00a04 (1.1%) vs 1 (0.3%)\n\n\nSignificant reduction in no sedation group\n\nMajor thrombotic events (PE or DVT)\n\n1 (0.3%) vs 10 (2.8%)\n\n\n\n\nSignificant increase in no sedation group of\n\nAccidental extubation requiring reintubation <24 hours\n\n31 (8.9%) vs 14 (4%) p=0.01\n\n\nAccidental removal of other equipment (NGT, art line)\n\n53 (15%) vs 32 (9%) p=0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact of the protocol:\n\nNo sedation group received higher doses of morphine over the first 3 days (0.0073 vs 0.006 Mg/kg/hr), while sedation group received more propofol and midazolam over the whole study (Supplement)\n\nHowever 27% of no sedation group crossed over to receive sedation during the first 24hours after randomization\nAgitation was the commonest reason for sedation, followed by oxygenation difficulties\n\n\nSeparation of the RASS score was only 1 on day 1 (-1.3 vs -2.3) and 1 on day 7 (-1.8 vs 2.8)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong critically ill adults receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU, mortality at 90 days did not differ significantly between those assigned to a plan of no sedation and those assigned to a plan of light sedation (i.e. to a level at which the patient was rousable) with daily interruption\n\nStrengths\n\nClinically important question applying to significant number of mechanically ventilated ICU patients\nA priori publication of trial protocol and statistical plan\nConducted in three countries across 8 sites\nNo loss to follow up\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSeparation of the two groups (RASS of 1 point) was arguably too little to test the study hypothesis.\n\nSignificant cross over from no sedation to light sedation \u00a0likely contributed to this\n\n\nNo blinded assessments\n14% of screened patients declined to participate in the study potentially leading to selection bias\nOther interventions that occurred while not sedated were not described (e.g mobilisation, communication)\nMortality as a primary outcome in sedation trials is controversial\nNo PTSD/psychological or patient wellbeing assessments presented\nNot generalisable to ICUs without 1:1 nursing:patient ratios\nNo assessment of nursing workload\nPowered to detect a 25% relative risk reduction in mortality. Differences less than this would still be clinically significant\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study\u00a0reported no significant difference in 90 day mortality with the use of no sedation vs. light sedation strategies\nAlthough there were reduced DVT/PE episodes in the no sedation group, there were more accidental extubations and removal of other equipment\nI will continue to my practice to target light sedation (ie RASS -2 to 1) combined with daily sedation breaks, while being careful to avoid over sedation\nThe\u00a0mortality point estimate favours light sedation and raises questions about the safety of a no sedation strategy\nFurther studies in this area should include assessment of the psychological effects on patients of no sedation, nursing workload, as well as whether this is feasible in other ICU environments\n\n\u00a0\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Nonsedation or Light Sedation in Critically Ill, Mechanically Ventilated Patients\n[further reading]\u00a0SCCM Guideline: Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption in Adult Patients in the ICU\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @aidanburrell\nSummary date:\u00a0 19th Feb 2020\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\n\n\n"
