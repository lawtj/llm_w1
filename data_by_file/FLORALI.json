There was a significant difference in favour of high-flow nasal oxygen in 90 day mortality\n\nStrengths\n\nA useful pragmatic trial that addresses an important clinical question\nThe co-ordinating centre and all investigators remained unaware of the study group outcomes until the data were locked\n\nWeaknesses\n\nA simpler study design may have been to compare high-flow oxygen to non-rebreather facemask or non-invasive ventilation\n25% of the patients in the non-invasive group received this treatment for less than 4 hours each day (IQR 4-12 on day 1; IQR 4-13 on day 2). 50% received this treatment for 8 hours or less. 75% spent the majority of the 24 hour period on facemask standard oxygen. There is a subsequently a large crossover effect with the standard facemask group\nThe name of the study is misleading (FLORALI = High FLow Nasal Oxygen in the Resuscitation of patients with Acute Lung Injury). This study is not an investigation of Acute Lung Injury (e.g. 21% of subjects had unilateral infiltrates, thus not meeting the definition of ALI). The most recent definition of ARDS also no longer recognises ALI\nMost patients had pneumonia (82%). The results of this study are not generalisable to all patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study demonstrates that high-flow oxygen via nasal cannula is non-inferior to oxygen delivered by a non-rebreather facemask and BiPAP in reducing the subsequent need for intubation.\nHigh flow oxygen reduces ICU and 90 day mortality compared with the other strategies. It also subjectively improves dyspnoea and respiratory discomfort at one hour compared with the other oxygen delivery devices.\nFurther studies are required to confirm whether high flow oxygen is beneficial in pulmonary and extra pulmonary causes of hypoxaemia and to determine its efficacy in ARDS.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0High-Flow Oxygen through Nasal Cannula in Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure\n[further reading] Editorial:\u00a0High-Flow Nasal Cannulae or Noninvasive Ventilation for Management of Postoperative Respiratory Failure\n[further reading] Trial Protocol\u00a0\n[further reading] Supplementary appendix\n[further reading] PulmCrit:\u00a0Pneumonia, BiPAP, secretions, and HFNC: New lessons from FLORALI\n[further reading] ICMWK: FLORALI \u2013 breath HFHO2 in through the nose\n[videocast]\u00a0ALI patients: the score standard vs NIV or High flow nasal oxygen therapy?\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @stevemathieu75\nSummary date: 26th May 2015\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n"
