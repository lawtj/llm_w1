NEJM 2018; 378: 809-818.\u00a0DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1705716\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients with septic shock, does the combination of hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone therapy reduce 90 day mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nThe use of steroids in critically ill patients continues to be controversial. Whilst there are signals for improved cardiovascular parameters, this did not translate to clear mortality benefits.\nThe most recent of these trials (ADRENAL, 2018), concluded that among patients with septic shock undergoing mechanical ventilation, a continuous infusion of hydrocortisone did not result in lower 90-day mortality than placebo.\n\nDesign\n\nMulti-centre\nRandomised placebo controlled trial\nDouble blinded\nInitially designed to have 4 parallel groups to evaluate benefits/risks of steroids and\u00a0drotrecogin alfa (DAA) in a 2 by 2 factorial design\n\nOriginal 4 groups\n\nGroup 1: Corticosteroids placebo + DAA placebo\nGroup 2: Corticosteroids + DAA placebo\nGroup 3: Corticosteroids placebo + DAA\nGroup 4: Corticosteroids + DAA\n\n\nWhen\u00a0drotrecogin alfa was withdrawn from the market, the trial was continued with 2 parallel groups\n\nGroup 1 and 3 combined\nGroup 2 and 4 combined\n\n\n\n\nRandomised by permuted blocks of 8\nIntention to treat analysis\nSample size calculation\n\nBased on anticipated 90 day mortality of 45% among pts with septic shock\n320 pts required in each of the original 4 groups (1280 pts total) for 95% power to detect an absolute difference of 10% in 90 day mortality (\u03b1=0.05)\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n34 French ICUs\nSeptember 2008 \u2013 June 2015\n\nTrial suspended twice: October 2011 \u2013 May 2012 (DAA withdrawal) and July 2014 \u2013 October 2014 (request of data and safety monitoring board to check the quality of the trial agents and the distribution of the serious adverse events)\n\n\n1671 patients screened; 1241 randomised into 4 groups\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Intensive care patients with indisputable or probable septic shock for less than 24 hours\n\nSeptic shocked defined as clinically or microbiologically documented infection\nSOFA score of 3 or 4 for at least 2 organs and at least 6 hours in duration\nVasopressor therapy for at least 6 hours to maintain a systolic blood pressure of at least 90mmHg or a mean blood pressure of 65mmHg\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nPresence of septic shock for more than 24 hours\nHigh risk of bleeding\nPregnancy or lactation\nUnderlying condition which would limit short-term survival\nKnown hypersensitivity to\u00a0drotrecogin alfa (later removed)\nPrevious treatment with corticosteroids\n\n\nBaseline characteristics were similar: intervention vs placebo group\n\nMean age (years): 66 vs 66\nMale sex (%): 65.5 vs 67.7\nMedical admission (%): 82.4 vs 81\nSOFA score: 12 vs 11\nSite of infection (%)\n\nUnknown: 1.8 vs 2.9\nLung: 60.7 vs 58.0\nAbdomen: 12.1 vs 10.9\nUrinary tract: 16.6 vs 18.8\n\n\nPositive blood culture (%): 36.6 vs 36.6\nVasopressor administration\n\nEpinephrine\n\nNumber of pts: 53 vs 58\nDose (mcg/kg/min): 2.31 vs 1.74\n\n\nNorepinephrine\n\nNumber of pts: 534 vs 552\nDose (mcg/kg/min): 1.02 vs 1.14\n\n\n\n\nMechanical ventilation (%): 92.3 vs 91.3\nRRT (%): 27.0 vs 28.1\n% of pts who received DAA: 17.1 (105/614) vs 16.4 (103/627)\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nHydrocortisone\n\n50mg IV bolus every 6 hours\n\n\nFludrocortisone\n\n50 mcg tablet once in the morning\n\n\nAdministered for 7 days without tapering\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\nSimilar in appearance and manufactured for the trial\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nBefore randomisation, plasma total cortisol levels measured before, 30 and 60 minutes after IV bolus of 250 mcg of corticotrophin (Synacthen)\nOther interventions were harmonised across centres according to 2008 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines\nNational guidelines for the prevention of superinfection were followed\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Significant reduction in 90 day mortality in intervention compared to control group\n\nIntervention group: 264 of 614 (43.0%) patients had died\nControl group: 308 of 627 (49.1%) patients had died\nRelative Risk (RR): 0.88 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.99;

The withdrawal of DAA has impacted aspects of this trial including statistical power calculation\n\nStatistical analysis published in supplementary material suggest no interaction with DAA and other treatments\nThe Fragility Index for several of the outcomes (including primary outcome) in favour of intervention is in single figures\n\n\nOutcome of Synacthen test conducted pre-randomisation was not mentioned or discussed in main paper\n\nResults discussed in supplementary material section where there was no difference between responders and non-responders in those from which the Synacthen test was actually conducted\n\n\nThe trial was conducted using the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines from 2008 which has since been updated\nVery sick patient population \u2013 the high doses of vasopressors used in the trial population may limit external validity\nNot all secondary endpoints included in original trial protocol reported on in final manuscript\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe addition of fludrocortisone and its effect is less well investigated compared to hydrocortisone by itself. It is not my current practice to administer this drug for refractory septic shock\nPrimary and secondary outcomes, including safety profile, shows a trend in favour of the corticosteroid group (consistent with the findings of the ADRENAL trial)\nI will continue my current practice of using hydrocortisone IV (6 hourly) for refractory septic shock\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Hydrocortisone plus Fludrocortisone for Adults with Septic Shock\n[further reading]\u00a0ADRENAL trial review\n[further reading]\u00a0TBL Steroid Review\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0Adrian Wong\nSummary date: 15 March 2018\nPeer-review editor: Segun Olusanya\n\n\n"
