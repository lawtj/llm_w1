JAMA 2021. doi:10.1001/jama.2021.16628\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients suffering an in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) does the use of vasopressin and methylprednisolone compared to a placebo result in increased rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)?\n\nBackground\n\nIHCA in the UK has an occurrence of 1:1000 admissions (~13000 per annum) and is poorly studied compared to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) with few large scale trials\nIHCA has been described as a different entity to OHCA\n\nDifferent aetiologies and often shorter time to recognition and effective CPR (and defibrillation if appropriate)\n\n\nIt has been reported that further strategies are needed to improve outcomes\nIn 2013, the VSE trial showed improved survival to hospital discharge with\u00a0 favourable neurological outcome with the addition of vasopressin and steroids alongside adrenaline\nIt has been shown that endogenous vasopressin levels are lower in non-survivors of cardiac arrest\nLikewise, cortisol levels have been demonstrated to be higher in those successfully resuscitated\n\nIt is thought this might relate to the cardiovascular effects of glucocorticoids such as increased sensitivity, increased production of enzymes involved in catecholamine synthesis and inhibition of breakdown\n\n\nA 2019 Cochrane Review concluded that vasopressin compared to standard dose adrenaline in OOHCA improved survival to admission but not ROSC, whereas the combination of vasopressin and adrenaline had no effect on these outcomes\n\nDesign\n\nInvestigator-initiated, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, double-blind, superiority trial\nRandomised in a 1:1 ratio\n\nRandom blocks of 2,4 or 6 used and blocks stratified by site\n\n\nTrial drugs brought to patient in blinded study kit by a dedicated member of the clinical cardiac arrest team\nPre-specified secondary and safety outcomes alongside 5 subgroups\nClinical data (SOFA score) collected at 24,48 and 72 hours post IHCA\nNeurological outcomes assessed at 30,90, 180 days and 1 year post IHCA\nSample size calculation required 492 patients\n\nalpha of 0.05 and power 80%\nBased on unpublished data showing IHCA ROSC rate of 45% in placebo group and 13% absolute difference in ROSC rates between groups\n\n\nConsent sought from patients or surrogates if survived\n\nTemporary consent gained from a physician independent of trial\n\n\nIndependent data monitoring committee oversaw trial\n\nSetting\n\n10 hospitals in Denmark\nOctober 2018 \u2013 January 2021\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n> 18 yo\nIHCA\nReceived at least 1 dose adrenaline\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nValid DNA-CPR\nPrior enrolment\nInvasive circulatory

each further adrenaline doses\n\n\n\nControl\n\n0.9% Sodium chloride\n\nAmpoules identical\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll other management at discretion of treating teams\n\nOutcome\n\nComparing\u00a0vasopressin/methylprednisolone vs. placebo\nPrimary outcome:\n\nROSC\n\n42% vs 33% \u2013 significantly higher in vasopressin/methylprednisolone group\nRR 1.30 (95% CI 1.03 \u2013 1.63), p = .03\nFragility Index = 3\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nNo significant difference at 30 or 90 days in\n\nSurvival\nFavourable neurological outcome\n\n\n\n\nSafety Outcomes\n\nHyperglycaemia: 77% v 73%\nHypernatraemia: 28% v 31%\nPneumonia: 21% v 17%\nGI bleeding: 5% v 3%\n\n\nIn those that survived to 30d or had favourable neurological outcome at 30 days no benefit shown in any subgroup\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe administration of vasopressin and methylprednisolone, compared\nto a placebo, significantly increased the likelihood of\nreturn of spontaneous circulation\nUncertainty remains as to whether this treatment results in long term survival benefit or harm\n\nStrengths\n\nImportant question to answer given previous benefits shown in trials in an area with few trials with large numbers recruited\nA large trial in a logistically challenging area\n\nIHCA are often fraught environments and enrolling, randomising and administering study drug within 9 minutes is notable\n\n\nGood internal validity\n\nMulticentre\nDouble blinded, placebo controlled\nGood randomisation strategy\nBalanced baseline characteristics\nGood adherence to protocol\n\n18 deviations in vasopressin / methylprednisolone group vs 19 in placebo\n\n\nPre-published protocol\n\n\nSensible primary outcome\n\nThe use of adrenaline in cardiac arrest algorithms is only based on increased rates of ROSC and 3 month survival\n\nIts use does not alter long term survival or survival with a favourable neurological outcome\n\n\nThe authors note that to adequately power a study to detect a 2% difference in neurological outcome would require > 7000 patients\nRates of ROSC may not seem patient focused however:\n\nFamilies might value this time as a chance to say goodbye\nThere were increased rates of organ donation in the PARAMEDIC2 trial\n\n\n\n\nIt seems reasonable to not place too much weight on the neurological outcome given:\n\nIt was not powered to detect this\nThere are some discrepancies between the various scoring tools of neurological outcome:\n\nThe rates of CPC 1 and 2 at 90 days were identical, this is contrast to the point estimate favouring harm for the mRS score at both 30 and 90 days (however neither were significant)\nThe EQ-5D-5L (a health related QoL metric) point estimates were higher in the vasopressin / methylprednisolone group at both 30 and 90 days (again neither significant)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Weaknesses\n\nHigh numbers excluded \u201cfor other reasons\u201d\n\nMostly clearly documented with valid reasons however 170 (7% of those screened) excluded due to \u201cphysician preference\u201d and in 193 (8% of those screened) \u201cteam forgot\u201d\n\nThis may introduce a selection bias\n\n\n\n\nOnly performed in one country (Denmark)\nRates of ROSC lower than study was powered for\n\nAchieved 33% in control, powered for a 45% rate of ROSC\nThis may introduce a type 1 error\n\n\nIn prior study that showed improved neurological function, steroids were continued for 7 days following ROSC\n\nIn those surviving > 24 hours there were higher rates of glucocorticoid use in the placebo group\n\n\nHigher rates of extracorporeal support in placebo group\nLow rates of TTM overall (27 v 26%)\n\nDespite the TTM2 trial results there is no data provided as to the number who were febrile. Additionally, the TTM trials studied OOHCA and no trial is yet to compare TTM to no TTM\n\n\nOverall 30d survival low\n\nThe UK 2019/2020 National Cardiac Arrest Audit showed 24% survival to hospital discharge. This is similar to a systematic review of IHCA outcomes in ANZ\n\n\nTheoretically those patients with normal conduction (i.e. PEA) may benefit more from high doses of vasopressors as opposed to shockable rhythms\n\nThis may be evidenced by the subgroup analysis looking at shockable vs non-shockable\nThis study had high rates of PEA (57% v 52%) so may not be as applicable to IHCA cohorts that have higher rates of shockable or asystolic rhythms\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAt present there is insufficient evidence to include the use of vasopressin and methylprednisolone as standard care in the management of IHCA\nHowever, given the evidence base for the use of adrenaline in cardiac arrest algorithms it will be interesting to see the recommendations of expert committees if further trials demonstrate a survival benefit\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Trial\n[editorial] Vasopressin and Steroids as Adjunctive Treatment for IHCA\n[further reading] European Resuscitation Council 2021 Guidelines\n[further reading] In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Review\n[podcast] Critical Care Reviews: VAM-IHCA\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker @hgmwalker89\nSummary date: 9th October 2021\nPeer-review editor:David Slessor\nPicture by: Pexels [Allec Gomes]\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
