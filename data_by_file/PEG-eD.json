DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa1909159\nClinical Question\n\nIn low and moderate risk patients presenting to the Emergency Department with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary embolism (PE), can a higher d-dimer threshold be used to safely exclude pulmonary embolism without the need for imaging?\n\nBackground\n\nDiagnostic testing for pulmonary embolism in the Emergency Department (ED) relies on the use of clinical assessment, biomarker levels and diagnostic imaging\nA d-dimer cut-off of < 500 ng per millilitre is the current default in most hospitals for excluding PEs in low-risk patients\nPatients with moderate risk pre-test probability are investigated with medical imaging in preference to d-dimer in most institutions\nImaging tests (mainly Computerised Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA)), exposes patients to radiation and the risk of contrast allergy. In addition, performing these tests can increase departmental length of stay\nIdentifying patients suspected of having PE who can be discharged safely without the need for diagnostic imaging is therefore important\nThe ADJUST-PE study from 2014 reported that the use of an adjusted d-dimer based on patient age, could be used to safely exclude PE\nThe YEARS study from 2017 found that a protocol for PE exclusion adjusted for pre-test probability and a d-dimer cut off of < 1000 was safe\nThe recently published European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pulmonary embolism\u00a0recommended considering the use of a d-dimer cut off adapted for clinical probability to exclude PE (class IIa; level B)\nPEG-eD aimed to investigate whether using a d-dimer cut-off of twice the usual threshold could be safely used to exclude PE. In addition, they also aimed to asses whether d-dimer could be used safely in patients at moderate risk of PE\n\nDesign\n\nProspective, multi-centre cohort study\nIntention to treat analysis\nSample size based on an estimate that patients diagnosed with VTE by 90 days was 0.8% if ruled out according to PEG-eD algorithm. 2,000 patients were calculated to provide 90% power to exclude a percentage with venous thromboembolism of 2.0%\nPre-test probability of PE determined by the seven-item Wells clinical prediction rule (scores range from 0 to 12.5)\n\nLow risk (low clinical pretest probability (CTP)): 0 to 4.0\nModerate risk (moderate CTP): 4.5 to 6.0\nHigh Risk (high CTP) : \u2265 6.5\nFurther investigation determined by the PEGeD algorithm:\n\nLow C-PTP and a d-dimer of < 1,000 ng per millilitre and moderate C-PTP and a d-dimer of < 500 ng per millilitre underwent no further diagnostic testing\n\n\n\n\nStudy outcomes assessed at 90 days after initial diagnostic testing, by telephone or in clinic\n\nSetting\n\nUniversity-based clinical centres in Canada\nDecember 2015 to May 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Outpatients with symptoms or signs suggestive of pulmonary embolism\nExclusion:\n\nYounger than 18 years of age,\nReceived full-dose anticoagulant therapy for 24 hours\nMajor surgery in the past 21 days\nD-dimer level known before the C-PTP was assessed\nChest imaging performed contrary to the protocol\nContrast-enhanced CT of the chest performed for another reason\nAn ongoing need for anticoagulant therapy\nLife expectancy of less than 3 months\nPregnant or geographically inaccessible for follow-up\n\n\n2017 patients included in the final analysis\nBaseline demographics:\n\nmean age of the patients was 52 years\n66.2% were female\n86.9% of the patients had a low C-PTP, 10.8% had a moderate C-PTP, and 2.3% had a high C-PTP\nd-Dimer testing was performed predominantly with the STA-Liatest assay (70.9% of the tests)\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nUse of the PEG-eD algorithm in all patients\n\nManagement of patients not meeting PEG-eD criteria\n\n\n\n\nAll other patients, including all patients with a high C-PTP, underwent chest imaging (mainly CTPA)\nIf chest imaging showed pulmonary embolism, patients received anticoagulant therapy; otherwise, patients did not receive anticoagulant therapy\n\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: No patients with a low or moderate C-PTP, with a d-dimer level below the predefined threshold, had evidence of symptomatic, objectively verified venous thromboembolism at 90-day follow up\n\n149 out of 2017 (7.4%) of patients were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism\nOf 1970 patients (97.7% of the total population) who had a low or moderate C-PTP, 1325 (67.3%) had a negative d-dimer test and did not receive anticoagulant therapy\nNone of these patients (95% confidence interval 0.00 to 0.29%) had venous thromboembolism during 90 day follow-up\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: Overall number of patients not diagnosed with VTE who subsequently had evidence of this at follow up:\n\n1 patient (0.05%; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.30), who had a low C-PTP, a positive d-dimer test (1200 ng per milliliter), and negative findings on CT pulmonary angiography\nOf the 1,285 patients with a low C-PTP, 315 patients had a D-dimer level of 500 to 999 ng per millilitre. None of these patients had a VTE on follow-up\nChest imaging reduced from 51.9% to 34.3% with PEG-eD algorithm (difference -17.6; 95% CI -19.2 to -15.9)\nThere were 7 major bleeding episodes, 23 minor bleeding episodes, and 34 deaths during follow-up\n34 deaths occurred during follow-up, none of which were deemed to be attributable to pulmonary embolism\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\n\n\nRuling out PE in patients with a low C-PTP who have a d-dimer level of less than 1000 ng per milliliter is a low-risk strategy. This strategy is also appropriate for excluding pulmonary embolism in patients with a moderate C-PTP who have a d-dimer level of less than 500 ng per millilitre\n\n\n\n\nStrengths\n\nAddresses a common Emergency Department presentation and clinical dilemma\nPower calculation performed for the precision of the estimate\nThe investigators used an internationally recognised and well-validated scoring system (Wells)\nResults consistent with prior studies in this area\n90-day follow-up appropriate to ensure all (or most) VTEs were captured\nIntention to treat analysis used\nCanadian setting means that results are likely to have reasonable external validity in the USA, Europe and Australia\nAll outcome events were evaluated with the use of predefined criteria by a central adjudication committee who were blinded to the results of diagnostic testing\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe overall PE rate was less than would be expected in an Emergency Department setting, and lower than that seen in the ADJUST-PE and YEARS studies, suggesting that the threshold for the investigation of PE was lower in this study\nIn addition, only 13% of patients were moderate or high-risk for PE\nThe 7.4% PE rate is however similar to that of other North American populations\nMost diagnostic work-ups for PE would include use of the PERC rule. In a low-risk patient, a negative PERC score would obviate the need for d-dimer\nOnly 40 patients were moderate risk CTP with a negative d-dimer, so no firm conclusions can be drawn from this group\nThis was an observational study, and may be subject to selection bias and convenience sampling\nThere was a discrepancy in numbers between figure 1 and table 1\nAs this was a cohort study, there was no direct comparison group of usual practice\nAlthough 2017 patients were included in the study, only 315 patients were directly relevant to answering the question of whether a higher d-dimer threshold can be safely used in low-risk patients. It is unclear how many of this group could have been excluded on the basis of Wells and PERC score alone\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nUsing a d-dimer cut off adjusted for clinical probability appears to be a safe strategy to reduce the use of diagnostic imaging in low-risk patients with PE\nThis approach should be adopted by Emergency Departments in the work-up of patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism with d-Dimer Adjusted to Clinical Probability\n[further reading]\u00a0Level Pegging?
