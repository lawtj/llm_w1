Critical Care Medicine. 2018;epublished August 1. doi:10.1097/CCM.0000000000003350\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients on noradrenaline for haemodynamic support, who required hemofiltration for AKI, does the use of a high cutoff hemofilter compared with a standard hemofilter impact the median hours of noradrenaline-free time at day 7?\n\nBackground\n\nIn patients receiving CRRT, high cutoff dialysis filters have been promoted as having enhanced middle molecule/inflammatory mediator clearance due to their higher permeability.\u00a0It is not known if patients with vasoplegic states have a clinically meaningful benefit from such practice.\nSeveral small trials have examined this question. An unblinded pilot study of 30 patients showed the group on the HCO filter had a significant decline in \u2018adjusted\u2019 noradrenaline dose over time.\nOther studies have examined the optimal dialysis dose in patients with septic shock. For example, the IVOIRE trial looked at high-volume exchanges (70ml/kg/hr vs 35ml/kg/hr) and did not improve outcomes.\nRemoval of cytokines may be a potentially appealing concept in vasoplegic patients. However, with all appealing concepts the complexity is likely incompletely understood and it is vital that such therapies are tested in well conducted randomised trials before being implemented. The last thing we want to do is cause harm to our patients.\n\nDesign\n\n1:1 randomisation within 12 hours of a decision to start hemofiltration\nAllocation concealment by computer generated program using permuted block sizes and opaque envelopes\nPatients, healthcare workers and researchers were blinded to treatment allocation\n\nThe 2 different filters were indistinguishable in appearance\n\n\n76 patients in total carried an 80% power of detecting a 25% difference in noradrenaline-free time in the first week with an alpha of 0.05.\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre tertiary ICU in Australia\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nPatients on noradrenaline for haemodynamic support\nPatients requiring CRRT for AKI (oliguria <100ml/6hr, unresponsive to fluid bolus, K+ >6.5mmol/l, acidemic \u00a0pH<7.2, urea > 25mmol/L, Cr>300umol/L or significant organ oedema).\n\n\nExclusion:\n\n<18-years-old\ndeath imminent\nprevious dialysis on this admission or chronic dialysis\npregnant/breast-feeding\n\n\n76 patients were randomised (38 per group)\n\n2 patients were subsequently excluded from analysis (one had an exclusion criteria and one died before treatment started)\nThis left 74 patients in the modified intention to treat analysis\n\n\nPatients were well matched for age, sex, severity of illness (APACHE II, APACHE III and SOFA scores)\n\nThere were some imbalance in the variables lactate, INR and oliguria\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nContinuous Veno-venous Haemofiltration with high cutoff filter (CVVH-HCO)\n\ncut-off point of 100kDa\n\n\n\nControl\n\nContinuous Veno-venous Haemofiltration with standard filter (CVVH-std)\n\ncut-off point 30kDa\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nDialysis dose = 25ml/kg/h\nBlood flow 200ml/min\nBicarbonate buffered replacement fluids\nAnticoagulation at discretion of treating intensivist, but usually low dose pre-filter heparin\nMaximum duration of therapy = 14 days\nDialysis continued until not needed, ICU discharge or death\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: median cumulative hours of noradrenaline-free time within the first week after randomisation\n\nIf the patient died whilst on noradrenaline, the days after death contributed to zero noradrenaline-free hours\nCVVH-HCO: 32 hours\u00a0noradrenaline-free\nCVVH-std: 56 hours noradrenaline-free\nP = 0.052\n\n\nSecondary outcome: CVVH-HCO vs CVVH-std\n\nMaximum noradrenaline rates: similar\nAlbumin levels: no difference\nTime to cease dialysis: no difference\nUnadjusted ICU mortality OR 2.17 (95% CI 0.84-5.58 p=0.109)\nUnadjusted hospital mortality OR 2.4 (95% CI 0.94-6.15 p=0.067)\nAdjusted for lactate, INR, serum albumin and APACHE 3\n\nAdjusted ICU mortality OR 2.13 (95% CI 0.69-6.65 p=0.191)\nAdjusted hospital mortality OR 2.49 (95% CI 0.81-7.66 p=0.112)\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with severe acute kidney injury and vasoplegic shock, use of a high cutoff dialysis filter compared with a standard filter, did not result in more noradrenaline-free time and did not improve other important secondary outcomes\n\nStrengths\n\nAllocation concealment and permuted block sizes (minimising selection bias)\nModified intention to treat analysis, complete follow-up (minimising attrition bias)\nDouble-blinded (reducing detection bias)\nBaseline imbalances were minor and were adjusted for in the secondary outcomes (reducing selection bias)\nOther than the intervention applied, patients were managed in a pragmatic way at the clinicians discretion (minimising performance bias)\nThe primary outcome of \u201cnoradrenaline-free time within the first week after randomisation\u201d is a robust surrogate and ameliorates the competing risk of mortality impacting on noradrenaline dose\nThe sample may be suitable for extrapolation to vasoplegic patients in general (with AKI and shock) as the sample was somewhat heterogenous (mainly septic shock, cardiogenic shock and liver failure)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe primary outcome is a surrogate outcome and may not be clinically meaningful\nSome of the secondary outcomes are clinically meaningful but it is difficult to draw too many conclusions from these as the study is not powered to detect a difference in these events, eg mortality\nThere were some baseline imbalances reflecting the small sample size\n\nThese were adjusted for but the analysis may not completely ameliorate this bias\n\n\nThere was no economic assessment\n\nI know in the unit I work the price difference between HCO filters and standard filters is $275 vs $240, which is not a great difference in the scheme of things\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial is very informative. There does not seem to be a benefit in using high cutoff filters. There is a signal toward harm.\nOutside the setting of a larger clinical trial, I will not use high cutoff filters in my vasoplegic patients with AKI.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0A Double-Blind RCT of High Cutoff vs Standard Hemofiltration in Critically Ill Patients with AKI\n[further reading]\u00a0IVOIRE trial\n[further reading]\u00a0Pilot study on the effects of high cutoff hemofiltration on the need for norepinephrine in septic patients with acute renal failure\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Celia Bradford\nSummary date: 23 August 2018\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
