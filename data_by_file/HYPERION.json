NEJM 2019; published on-line; DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa1906661\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with coma following cardiac arrest with a non-shockable rhythm, does moderate hypothermia vs. normothermia, improve neurological outcome?\n\nBackground\n\nThe HACA trial in 2000 reported that therapeutic hypothermia following a VF arrest improved favourable neurological outcome. However a number of patients in the control group developed fever and it was therefore unclear if the reported benefits were from hypothermia or the avoidance of fever\nThe TTM study compared a targeted temperature of 33C vs. 36C in patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from a presumed cardiac cause. They reported no significant difference\nA sub-study (n=178) of the TTM trial reported no benefit with 33C vs. 36C in patients with cardiac arrest with an initial non-shockable rhythm. This trial excluded patients with presumed non-cardiac causes of cardiac arrest as well as patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest\nILCOR guidelines recommend targeted temperature management with target temperature of 32-36C, for all patients with coma following cardiac arrest\nWith the current evidence it is unclear if therapeutic hypothermia is of benefit to patients following cardiac arrest with non-shockable rhythms, including those with an in-hospital cardiac arrest\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\n\nRandomised by web-based system\n1:1 ratio with permuted blocks of varying sizes\nStratified by centre and cause of cardiac arrest (presumed cardiac vs. non-cardiac)\n\n\nOpen-label, blinded-outcome-assessor\nFollow up at 90 days post randomisation, with semi-structured telephone interview by a single psychologist\n584 patients required to give a 80% power to detect an improvement in the primary outcome from 14% to 23%, with a 2 sided significant level of 5%\nPatients with missing data assumed to have died (1 patient in intervention group and 2 patients in control group)\n\nSetting\n\n25 ICUs in France (11 university and 14 community hospitals)\nData collected: 2014 \u2013 2018\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nAge >=18 years\nResuscitated from out-of-hospital or in-hospital cardiac arrest with a non-shockable rhythm due to any cause\nGCS <=8 at ICU admission or if sedated GCS score prior to sedation\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nNo-flow time (time from collapse to initiation of CPR) > 10 minutes\nLow-flow time (time from initiation of CPR to return of spontaneous circulation) >60 minutes\nEpinephrine or norepinephrine infusion >1mcg/kg/min\nTime from cardiac arrest to screening >300 minutes\nMoribund; Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis of liver; pregnancy or breast feeding\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nAge (median): 67 vs. 67\nMale sex: 65% vs. 63%\nCharlson comorbidity index (median): 4 vs. 4\nIn-hospital cardiac arrest: 26% vs. 29%\nBy-stander witnessed cardiac arrest: 97% vs. 92%\nBystander CPR: 70% vs. 70%\n1st monitored rhythm\n\nAsystole: 78% vs. 81%\nPEA: 12% vs. 12%\nUnknown (not shocked): 11% vs. 7%\n\n\nCause of cardiac arrest\n\nAsphyxia: 56% vs. 55%\nCardiac cause: 28% vs. 27%\nGCS at enrolment (median): 3 vs. 3\nCirculatory shock: 56% vs. 61%\nDuration from cardiac arrest to randomisation: 233 vs. 219 minutes\n\n\n\n\n584 patients randomised out of 2723 assessed for eligibility\n\nIntervention\n\nHypothermia\n\n33C (+/-0.5C) induced and maintained for 24 hours\nEach centre followed its standard protocol of internal or external cooling\n\nIntravascular cooling catheter 15.1%\nDedicated closed loop surface device 47.9%\nBasic external cooling device with no closed loop: 37.0%\n\n\nCooling began a median of 16 minutes post randomisation, stopped prematurely in 12.7%, with nearly half of these being due to suspected brain death\nRe-warmed at a rate of 0.25-0.5C per hour to 36.5-37.5C, which was maintained for 24 hours\nSedation targeted Richmond Agitation-Sedation Score of -5.

This was not the case in the TTM trial\nSingle assessor of primary outcome\nOnly performed in 1 country limiting generalisability. A number of patients had their sedation stopped early due to suspected brain death. This would not be a common practice at my local institution\nLow fragility index that was less than both the number of patients that withdrew and the number of patients with missing data\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis randomised controlled trial reported significantly improved neurological outcomes in patients with coma following a non-shockable cardiac arrest, who were treated with moderate hypothermia compared with normothermia\nDue to a number of differences between the treatment of the intervention and the control groups, as well as the low fragility index and the significant number of patients who developed a fever in the control group, further evidence is required to confirm these findings\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Targeted Temperature Management for Cardiac Arrest with Nonshockable Rhythm\n[further reading]\u00a0PulmCrit: Hypothermia for non-shockable arrest: let\u2019s not get hot-headed about this\n[further reading]\u00a0TBL: temperature control trials\n[further reading] TBL: Fragility Index\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: David Slessor\nSummary date: 10th October 2019\nPeer-review editor: Steve Mathieu\n\n\n"
