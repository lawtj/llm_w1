The Lancet 2020; in press. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31042-4\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients with COVID-19, does combined interferon beta-1b, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, and ribavirin, compared with lopinavir-ritonavir alone, reduce the time to a negative swab result?\n\nBackground\n\nA prior case series by Young et al showed variable results in patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir\nA recently published clinical trial with lopinavir-ritonavir did not demonstrate efficacy in reducing mortality and did not reduce viral loads or duration of viral detectability\nPrior data with lopinavir-ritonavir/ribavirin in combination was shown to be beneficial in patients with SARS, and interferon beta-1b may decrease viral load\nThe authors state that this is the first RCT on the triple combination of interferon \u03b2-1b, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, and ribavirin, compared with single-drug lopinavir\u2013ritonavir in the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19\n\nDesign\n\nPhase 2, multicentre, open-label, randomised trial\nPatients were randomly assigned (2:1) to either treatment group or control\n\nSimple randomization with no stratification\nOpen label randomization\nComputer generated randomization\n\n\nPrimary efficacy analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis\nThe necessary sample size had been calculated to be 30 patients per group to detect such a difference at a two-sided \u03b1 level of 0.05, with 80% power\n\nThe protocol proposed recruiting at least 35 patients per group to\nallow for a 17% dropout rate\nThese numbers were based on the authors\u2019 prior study with the 2003 SARS-CoV virus, as there were insufficient mortality data on SARS-CoV-2, with estimated reduction of 26.4% in the 21 day mortality or ARDS rate from a baseline of 28.8%\n\n\nNo placebo group\n\nAuthors stated that placebos are generally not accepted in Chinese culture\nThe authors\u2019 previous study showed that interferon \u03b2-1b and lopinavir\u2013ritonavir are active against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nSix major public hospitals in Hong Kong, serving 75% of the population of 7.5 million\nAll patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were routinely admitted to hospital\nStudy conducted from February 10 to March 20, 2020\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAge at least 18 hospitalized for virologically

days\nRibavirin 400 mg twice daily for 14 days\nInterferon \u03b2-1b 8 million IU alternate day until day 6 post symptom onset (median of two doses administered, range 1-3 doses)\n\n\n\u00a0If presented between 7 and 14 days from symptoms onset (n=34)\n\nCombination lopinavir-ritonavir 400-100 mg and ribavirin 400 mg twice daily without interferon \u03b2-1b\n\n\n\nControl\n\nCombination of

p=1\n\n\nAdverse events during treatment\n\nAll adverse events: 48% vs. 49%\nDiarrhoea: 40% vs. 44%\nIncreased alanine transaminase: 13% vs. 17%\n\nThe authors reported only 1 treatment discontinuation (in the control group) due to an elevated ALT. In comparison, LOTUS China reported nearly 14% of their lopinavir-ritonavir group did not complete treatment due to side effects\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCytokine/chemokine changes (analyzed in the first 84 recruited patients)\n\nThe IL-6 concentration in the combination group (64 patients) was significantly lower than in the control group (24 patients) on days 2 (p=0.0060), 6 (p=0.0040), and 8 (p=0.0020)\nTNF\u03b1 concentrations and IL-10 concentrations: no significant differences\n\n\nEmergence of amino acid mutations in the nsp5 gene encoding a 3C-like protease\n\nNo significant mutations detected\n\n\n\n\nPost-hoc analyses\n\nStatistically significant clinical and virological differences were seen between the treatment (n=52) and control group (n=24) for patients who started treatment <7 days after symptom onset, across all measured\nvariables except stool samples\nNo significant differences seen between the treatment (n=34) and control group (n=17) for patients who started treatment 7 or more days after symptom onset\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\u201cTriple antiviral therapy with interferon \u03b2-1b, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, and ribavirin were safe and superior to lopinavir\u2013ritonavir alone in shortening virus shedding, alleviating symptoms, and facilitating discharge of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19\u201d\n\nStrengths\n\nMedian time from symptom onset to start of treatment was 5 days (4\u20137) for the combination group and 4 days (3\u20138) for the control group\n\nThis may have captured the patients within a more optimal window of opportunity for treatment\nIn comparison, the LOTUS CHINA study showing negative results with lopinavir-ritonavir had a median time to treatment of 13 days which may have been too late in the disease course\n\n\nThe number of patients screened accounted for 80% of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong during this period\n\nIncreases external validity by using a sample that likely is a good representation of the general population of interest\n\n\nThe funders had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report\nPrimary efficacy analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNo placebo group, trial used an active control\n\nAuthors attribute this in part to Chinese culture\n\n\nOpen-label nature of the trial meant a lack of blinding\n\nIntroduces bias to the study\n\n\nSome patients in the treatment group did not receive\u00a0interferon \u03b2-1b, depending on when they presented\n\nDifficult to tease out the role of interferon \u03b2-1b\n\n\nAbsence of critically ill patients did not allow the generalization of our findings to severe cases\n\nOnly one patient in the study (control group) was placed on ventilator support\n\n\nAuthors note that \u201cUnder the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\npublic health ordinance, all patients with COVID-19 must stay in hospital until nasopharyngeal swab viral loads are negative on 2 consecutive days\u201d\n\nUnclear if these patients would have been hospitalized in the United States or other health care systems\n\n\nPower and sample size calculations were based on SARS-CoV-1 due to a lack of clinical information on SARS-CoV-2\n\nAssumes that the viruses are similar in their virulence, if incorrect then the study design is impacted\n\n\nPrimary outcome was not patient centred\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA small RCT demonstrated that aggressive triple therapy combination treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon \u03b2-1b was superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone in reducing the time to a negative swab result\nIn a population with a low severity of illness they reported secondary outcomes that demonstrated a shorter time to clinical improvement and a reduced duration of hospital stay with the combination therapy. Post-hoc analysis reported that the benefits were limited to when the treatment was started within 7 days of symptom onset and included interferon\nLarger RCTs will be required to clarify the therapeutic potential/role of each individual agent and determine their applicability to patients who present later in the disease progression and who have more severe symptoms. These studies should utilise a patient centred primary outcome\nThis is a unique study that adds to the literature and should serve as a springboard for other, larger studies\n\nExternal Links\n\nHung I et al.
