Considered \u201clandmark\u201d even when US used to \u2018mark and go\u2019 as oppose to real-time guided\nDifferent antiseptic preparations and dressings used across participating sites\nPrimary outcome a composite measure of CRBSI and DVT\nHigh rate of failure and crossover in subclavian site arm (14.7%)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study confirmed conventional wisdom that the use of subclavian veins for CVC catheterisation was associated with low risk of infection but highest risk of pneumothoraces. However, in this study, the use of ultrasound for subclavian CVC was relatively low.\nThis study has not changed my practice and I will continue using ultrasound guided internal jugular lines as my first choice technique. I would choose the femoral route over subclavian. If a subclavian line is needed, I would continue using ultrasound to guide insertion accepting that the risk might be higher.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Intravascular Complications of Central Venous Catherization by Insertion Site\n[further reading]\u00a0EMNerd: The case of the blind allocator\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @avkwong\nSummary date: 28th October 2015\nPeer-review editor: @stevemathieu75\n\n\n"
