Trial\nAndrews.\u00a0JAMA\u00a02017;318(13):1233-1240. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.10913\nClinical Question\n\nIn Zambian adults with sepsis and hypotension, does a resuscitation protocol implemented early after presentation to the Emergency Department improve in-hospital mortality compared with usual care?\n\nBackground\n\nThe implementation of sepsis protocols as the standard of care in the developed world has contributed to a reduction in sepsis mortality\nThe mortality from sepsis remains high in the developing world\nIt remains uncertain whether early sepsis resuscitation protocols could improve mortality from sepsis in resource-limited settings\nPatients who receive usual care may be at high risk of under-resuscitation, and therefore a time-based protocol to promote aggressive use of fluids, blood, and vasopressors may improve the quality of resuscitation and reduce mortality\nThe FEAST study showed increased mortality with intravenous fluid bolus administration in African children with sepsis\nA randomised clinical trial conducted in Zambia, investigating intravenous fluids and vasopressor support in sepsis, was stopped early due to possible harm in patients with hypoxia and tachypnoea\n\nDesign\n\nSingle-centre, randomised controlled study\nPermuted block randomisation was performed by computer\nPatients, treating clinicians, and clinical study personnel were unblinded to participant enrolment but those responsible for data analysis were blinded\nSealed, opaque envelopes were used to preserve allocation concealment\nPower calculation\n\nStatistical power (beta) set at 80% (20% chance of false negative)\nStatistical significance level (alpha) defined at 0.05 (5% chance of false positive)\nAssumed a baseline mortality rate of 65% (previous trial data)\nExpected absolute risk reduction of 20%\n212 patients were required\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n1500 bed national referral university hospital in Zambia\nOctober 2012 \u2013 November 2013\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion\n\nPatients presenting to the Emergency Department aged 18 years or older with sepsis (defined as suspected infection plus \u22652 systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria) and hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure \u226490 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure \u226465 mm Hg)\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nThe presence of hypoxaemia and severe tachypnoea (defined as arterial oxygen saturation <90% and respiratory rate >40 breaths per minute)\nAdditional exclusion criteria included gastrointestinal bleeding in the absence of fever, congestive heart failure exacerbation, end-stage renal disease, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), incarceration, or the need for immediate surgery\n\n\n209 patients received the study interventions, completed follow-up, and were included in the primary analysis\nBoth groups were similar at baseline\n\nMean age was 36.7 years\n89.5% of patients were HIV positive, with a median CD4 count of 66/\u00b5L\nMedian albumin level: 22 g/l\nMedian middle arm circumference: 22.1 cm\nMedian lactate level: 4.3 mmol/l\nDiagnosis on admission:\n\nPneumonia 49.3%\nTuberculosis 62.7%\nBoth 38.3%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nPatients received haemodynamic management for the first 6 hours after enrolment\n\nAn initial 2000 ml bolus of intravenous isotonic crystalloid was administered within 1 hour of enrolment, followed by an additional 2000 ml over the subsequent 4 hours to a total of 4 litres\n\nFluid therapy was stopped if the nurse identified any of the following:\n\nOxygen saturation decrease of 3%\nRespiratory rate increase by 5 breaths per minute\nJVP reached 3cm above sternal angle\n4 litres had been given\n\n\n\n\nIf mean arterial pressure remained less than 65 mm Hg after completion of the initial 2000 ml fluid bolus, a dopamine infusion was initiated at 10 \u00b5g/kg/min\nBlood transfusion was administered to maintain a haemoglobin level of greater than 7 g/dL or with severe pallor\n\n\n\nControl\n\nTreating clinicians determined intravenous fluid administration, vasopressor use, and blood transfusion\nDuring usual care for sepsis in the study setting, in the first 6 hours\n\nthe volume of intravenous fluid administered averages less than 2 litres\n< 50% of patients received any intravenous fluid bolus\n< 20% of patients received a blood transfusion\n< 2% of patients received a vasopressor\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nTreating clinicians determined the location of care (intensive care unit or medical ward) and antibiotic selection\nA dedicated study nurse measured heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation hourly for the 6 hours after enrolment and supervised the administration of all ordered fluids and medications\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: In-hospital mortality was higher in the sepsis protocol group\n\nSepsis protocol 48.1% vs Standard care 33.0%\n\nAbsolute Risk Increase (ARI): 15.1% (95% CI 2.0%-28.3%; P = 0.0344)\nRelative Risk (RR): 1.46 (95% CI 1.04-2.05)\nNumber Needed to Harm (NNH): 7 patients\n\n\nIn the multivariate analysis adjusting for SAPS-3 at enrolment, risk of in-hospital mortality (RR 1.45 [95% CI 1.04-2.02];\u00a0P\u2009=\u2009.03) and 28-day mortality (RR 1.41 [95% CI 1.08-1.84];\u00a0P\u2009=\u2009.01) was greater in the sepsis protocol group than in the usual care group\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nMedian hospital length of stay was 5 days (IQR 3-8 days) in the sepsis protocol group vs 7 days (IQR 4-12 days) in the usual care group (P = .01)\nRates of adverse events were similar between groups\nPatients in the sepsis protocol group received more intravenous fluid (median 3.5 L [IQR 2.7-4.0 L]) compared with patients in the usual care group (median 2.0 L [IQR 1.0-2.5 L];\u00a0P\u2009<\u2009.001) and more frequently received dopamine (Sepsis protocol 14.2% vs Standard care 1.9%;\u00a0P\u2009<\u2009.001)\n\u00a0In the usual care group, only about half of the patients received any intravenous fluids (n\u2009=\u200950; 48.3%)\n\nMore patients in the sepsis protocol group experienced worsening hypoxemia or tachypnea (35.8%) compared with the usual care group (22.3%;\u00a0P\u2009=\u2009.03)\nOnly 1 patient was admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), which is not surprising given that there are only 10 ICU beds in Zambia, a country of 13 million people\n\n\nPatients in the sepsis protocol group had a greater reduction in blood lactate levels after resuscitation (-1.2 mmol/L (-3.4 to 0.3) vs. -0.5 mmol/L (-2.2 to 1.1)]\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong adults with sepsis and hypotension, most of whom were positive for HIV, in a resource-limited setting, a protocol for early resuscitation with administration of intravenous fluids and vasopressors increased in-hospital mortality compared with usual care\n\nStrengths\n\nManagement of sepsis in the developing world is a very important and under-researched area so this is an important study\nAllowance was made in the study design for the potential deleterious effects of IV fluids, with hypoxic patients excluded from the study\n\nThe harmful effects of protocolised sepsis resuscitation may have been even greater had hypoxic patients been included\nIn addition, the study protocol accounted for the cessation of IV fluid therapy if evidence of respiratory compromise from volume overload existed\n\n\nThe randomisation process ensured that both groups were similar at baseline\nThe allocation concealment process was robust, with sealed envelopes and permuted block randomisation by computer\nAll analyses were conducted in an intention to treat basis\nA conventional blood transfusion trigger of 70 g/dl was used\nClear between-group separation was achieved with respect to IV fluid administration in the first six and twenty four hours (median difference 1.5 and 1.0 litres respectively; p < 0.001)\nA clear difference was also found in dopamine administration between the groups (14.2 vs. 1.9%; p < 0.001)\nThe study results were consistent with previous randomised controlled trials within the developing world setting\nThe primary outcome of mortality at 28 days was relevant and patient-centred\nAn adjusted analysis for SAPS-3 score was performed\nThe mortality difference persisted in the multivariate analysis adjusting for severity of illness and across pre-specified subgroups defined by preexisting HIV infection and baseline Glasgow Coma Scale score, haemoglobin level, lactate level, severity of illness, and jugular venous pressure\nNo patients were lost to follow-up for primary outcome analysis\n\n3 patients were excluded after randomisation and were therefore not included in primary outcome analysis (leading to a modified Intention To Treat analysis)\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThere is limited generalisability to the developed world as most patients were young, malnourished and HIV positive (with median CD4 counts of 66u/L)\n\nIn addition, Intensive Care support for deteriorating patients was unavailable due to resource constraints\n\n\nThis was a single-centre study in which research staff and treating clinicians were unblinded to the allocation groups\n\nThis may have led to clinician bias and a difference in uncontrolled interventions between the study groups\n\n\nConvenience sampling was used, with participants being recruited between Monday morning and midday on Friday\nThe inclusion criteria for the study was based upon the traditional Surviving Sepsis Campaign/ American College of Respiratory Physicians criteria for septic shock\n\nThese criteria were based on the clinical characteristics of comparatively older patients, most of whom had chronic health problems\n\n\nUsual care involved a dedicated study nurse measuring clinical observations hourly and supervising the administration of all ordered fluids and medications\n\nIt is unclear whether this is normal practice in a sub-Saharan African hospital\n\n\nYoung, malnourished patients in the developing world may have been hypotensive at baseline rather than this being as a result of sepsis-induced vasoplegia\nPatients were included with septic shock on the basis of a systolic blood pressure of < 90mmHg or a MAP of < 65mmHg\n\nThis differs from the recent EGDT studies and SSC criteria which would mandate fluid resuscitation prior to this diagnosis\n\n\nPatients in the sepsis protocol group received 2 litres of IV fluids in the first hour\n\nA significant number of these patients were malnourished, and this would have been significantly more than 30 mls/kg\nAlmost 40% of patients in the treatment group received 4 litres or more of IV fluid therapy by six hours after study enrollment\n\n\nDue mainly to resource limitations, intravenous fluids were not titrated to haemodynamic parameters\n\nThey were instead discontinued when patients showed evidence of respiratory compromise\nAdministering IV fluids until a patient is clinically volume overloaded is unsophisticated and at variance with developed world practice\n\n\nOn average, patients in the usual care group received IV antibiotics thirty minutes earlier, however this was a non-significant difference (p = 0.15)\nDopamine was used for vasopressor support and this is another intervention that limits generalisability to the developed world\nMortality outcomes were limited to 28 days\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nConsistent with previous studies in this area, protocolised intravenous fluids and dopamine appears to be harmful in African patients presenting with severe sepsis\nThis should be abandoned as a treatment strategy in this setting\nDue to significant differences in patient characteristics and hospital resources, these results cannot be translated to the developed world\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]Effect of an Early Resuscitation Protocol on In-hospital Mortality Among Adults With Sepsis
