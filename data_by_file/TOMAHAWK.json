DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2101909\nClinical Question\n\nIn adults > 30 years old suffering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) without ST elevation on their ECG does routine immediate coronary angiography compared to a delayed or selective approach to coronary angiography improve 30-day all-cause mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nThe DISCO pilot study showed that in this cohort of patients a culprit lesion was found in ~37% of those undergoing immediate coronary angiography\n\nA culprit lesion was defined as a stenosis > 50%\n\n\n2021 ERC guidelines currently suggest that emergent coronary angiography should be considered if there is high clinical suspicion of a coronary artery occlusion (e.g. haemodynamic compromise / electrical instability)\n\nThis is a subtle change from the 2015 guidelines\n\n\nThis was based on the COACT trial\n\nThis trial found in those with an initial shockable rhythm without ST elevation on their ECG that immediate coronary angiography did not improve 90-day mortality\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nInvestigator initiated, randomised, multi-centre, open-label trial\nScreened for eligibility on ED arrival\nIf eligibility criteria met, then randomised in 1:1 ratio using a web-based system\n\nRandomly changing block sizes used\n\n\nPrimary outcome was all cause mortality at 30 days\nMultiple pre-specified secondary end points and pre-specified subgroup analyses\nPower calculations based on 2012 registry study which showed 30-day mortality 34% in immediate angiography vs. 46% in delayed angiography\n\nParameters for calculation provided in supplementary appendix\n558 patients were calculated to provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of no difference\n\nInterim analysis planned after 109 events\n\n\n\n\nPrimary analysis performed on an ITT basis\n\nA sensitivity analysis was performed with a per-protocol analysis, and safety analyses performed according to those treated\n\n\nAppropriate consent process (described in supplementary appendix)\nRegistered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02750462\n\nSetting\n\n31 sites in Germany and Denmark\nNovember 2016 \u2013 September 2019\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdults > 30 years\nResuscitated OOHCA (both shockable and non-shockable rhythms)\nInformed consent\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nST-segment elevation or LBBB\nNo ROSC on hospital admission\nSevere haemodynamic or electrical instability\n\nClinical criteria for haemodynamic instability were initially provided, however for the final study protocol these were removed and the decision was left to the discretion of the treating clinician\n\n\nObvious extra-cardiac cause (e.g. TBI, drowning etc)\nIn-hospital cardiac arrest\nPregnancy (known or suspected)\nParticipation in another trial interfering with the research questions of TOMAHAWK\n\n\n558 patients eligible \u279d 554 randomised (4 not randomised due to technical reasons)\n\n281 \u279d Immediate angiography \u279d 265 analysed\n273 \u279d Delayed /

an acute coronary trigger was high (based on examination and testing at discretion of treating physician) then could proceed to angiography with a minimum of a 24 hour delay\nCriteria for angiography prior to 24 hour delay included:\n\nSubstantial myocardial damage (cardiac troponin >70x ULN or increase in CK 10x ULN at least 6 hours post arrest)\nElectrical instability\nCardiogenic shock\nNew

Conclusions\n\nIn resuscitated patients with a possible cardiac cause of OOHCA without ST elevation or LBBB an immediate coronary angiography strategy did not reduce 30 day risk of death from any cause compared to a delayed or selective coronary angiography strategy\n\nStrengths\n\nGood randomisation process with randomly changing block size and sensible inclusion and exclusion criteria\nBalanced baseline characteristics\nPrimary outcome patient focused\nAll end-points clearly defined, thus minimising variability between outcome assessors\nPre-specified secondary outcomes, safety outcomes and subgroups\nMulti-centre trial across two European countries increases external validity\nPrimary outcome performed on an ITT basis\nFindings correlate with COACT trial\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDespite only 4 of those who were eligible not being randomised, a screening log was only collected at the very beginning of the trial\n\nThis may introduce an unrecognised selection bias as there is no record as to why potentially eligible patients are not enrolled\n\n\nMany would advocate for immediate angiography if an OOHCA patient with a potential cardiac cause was haemodynamically unstable or in cardiogenic shock\n\nThis exclusion criteria was changed from initially having a set of criteria to being solely at the clinical discretion of treating physician.\nIt is unclear as to the degree of haemodynamic instability for which patients were excluded.\n\nThis makes it harder to fully understand the haemodynamic characteristics of patients involved.\n\n\n\n\nUnblinded\n\nUnderstandable that treating staff not blinded but no mention that trial members not involved in clinical management were blinded\n\n\nThe 12% absolute difference in 30-day mortality that the power calculations were based on seems high\n\nThe authors acknowledge this is based the minimal available data at the time of study planning. However, the exclusion of high risk patients who are likely to benefit from immediate PCI (e.g. haemodynamic or electrical instability) means that a 12% absolute difference between groups is potentially optimistic\n\n\n95% CI for secondary outcomes are not adjusted for multiplicity\n\nThis means inferences drawn from these may not be reproducible, so as the authors rightly state, the secondary outcome are hypothesis generating only\n\n\nHigh rates of cross-over from delayed / selective strategy \u279d coronary angiography < 24 hours\n\n46 patients (17%)\n\n24 of these were for permitted reasons (11 cardiogenic shock, 6 Large myocardial injury, 5 new ST-Elevation, 2 electrical instability)\n22 of these violated study protocol\n\n\n\n\nCurrently the published follow-up is only to 30 days, longer term follow up (which is planned) may reveal some clinically important differences between groups e.g. LV function\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFor patients presenting with a suspected cardiac cause of OOHCA who are haemodynamically stable, there appears to be no benefit from immediate angiography\nAs such, admission to the ICU for ongoing stabilisation and investigation is a reasonable initial management strategy for this group of patients\nFor patients with haemodynamic compromise or electrical instability I will continue to discuss with cardiology about optimal timing for angiography\nFurther trials such as ARREST and DISCO will continue to inform practice\n\nExternal Links\n\n[paper] TOMAHAWK trial\n[further reading] 2020 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker @hgmwalker89\nSummary date: 2nd September 2021\nPeer-review editor: David Slessor\nImage by: iStock\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
