Thorax 2017: 0:1\u20139. doi:10.1136/thoraxjnl-2016-209858\nClinical Question\n\nDoes an increased intensity of ICU based physical rehabilitation therapy improve improve long-term physical quality of life compared with a standard intensity of physical rehabilitation?\n\nBackground\n\nPhysical and psychological recovery after a period of critical illness is slow and often incomplete\nCurrent evidence informs us that patients report ongoing physical and psychological problems, and a decreased quality of life, for up to 5 years after their original illness\nWhilst the aetiology of critical illness neuromyopathy is multifactorial, limiting the period of immobility and promoting movement and exercise are intuitively attractive strategies to prevent muscle weakness and enhance recovery\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nPatients were randomised to increased intensity or standard physiotherapy in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by admitting ICU, admission type and level of independence (Katz Index)\nAllocation-concealed\nParticipants, research physiotherapists and the wider clinical team were not blinded to the treatment group\nParticipants were followed until hospital discharge and invited to attend a follow-up at their hospital 3 and 6months after randomisation. Follow-up questionnaires could be completed by telephone if participants were unable to attend in person\nA sample size calculation based on a difference of five points in the primary outcome (mean Physical Component Summary (PCS) measure of the 36 item Short Form Survey (SF-36)), 80% power and a significance level of 0.05 required 77 patients to contribute primary outcome data at 6 months.\u00a0Allowing for a mortality rate of 40% and a further 10% loss to follow-up required 154 in each group. At 6 months 116 patients (of 308 randomised) contributed primary outcome data (99 had died, 16 had withdrawn and 77 were lost to follow up)\n\nSetting\n\n4 mixed medical-surgical ICUs in 4 UK hospitals\nJan 2012 \u2013 Dec 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\u00a018 years or older and had received 48 hours or more of either invasive or non-invasive ventilation\nExclusion: End-of-life care; acute brain or spinal cord injury (or admitted following brain or spinal cord surgery); multiple trauma if mobilisation therapy was judged unlikely to be possible; burns; rapidly progressive neuromuscular disease; patients enrolled in another clinical trial without a co-enrolment agreement in place; and patients previously enrolled in this trial. Patients could be recruited following a cardiac arrest if the clinical team believed there was a possibility of recovery\n308 patients\nSimilar baseline characteristics in both study groups although the proportion of males in the intensive group (54%) was lower than in the standard group (63%). Most patients were emergency admissions with similar illness severity scores (mean APACHE II was 19) and high pre-hospital independence\n\nMean duration of ICU ventilation (days) was 4 in both groups\nAlmost all patients received invasive ventilation (>98%)\nICU length of stay was similar: mean 5-6 days\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nIntensive physical rehabilitation\nTarget delivery of 90 min of physical rehabilitation per day (Monday to Friday), split between at least two sessions\n\nControl\n\nStandard care physical rehabilitation\nTarget of 30 min of physical rehabilitation per day (Monday to Friday)\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll physical rehabilitation sessions were preceded by a sedation hold (or titration) with a target Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) of \u22121, 0 or +1\n\nPatients were considered safe enough\u00a0to undertake a sedation hold (or titration) in 88% (n= 4079) of the intensive group and 85% (n=2141) of the standard care group\n51% of the intensive group vs 53% of standard care group had a successful sedation hold (or titration) and passed the safety screen\n\n\nThe physical rehabilitation therapy included functional training and individually tailored exercise programmes and was delivered by experienced critical care physiotherapists\nFollowing discharge from ICU, both groups received routine ward-based physiotherapy and an exercise diary to continue independently on discharge from hospital\nAny participant readmitted to ICU received standard physical rehabilitation during their first and any subsequent readmissions\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Mean Physical Component Summary (PCS) measure of the 36 item Short Form Survey (SF-36) Quality of Life questionnaire at 6 months was similar in both groups\n\n37 (SD 12.2) in the intervention group vs 37 (SD 11.3) in the standard care group\n\n\nSecondary outcome: all similar between groups (intervention vs standard care) across all follow-up time points apart from the Functional Independence Measure at 3 months\n\nMean Mental Health Component Summary (MCS) measure of the SF-36\n\n40 vs 39 at hospital discharge\n47 vs 45 at 3 months\n47 vs 48 at 6 months\n\n\nMean physical ability at ICU discharge (Modified Rivermead Mobility Index)\n\n19 vs 16 at ICU discharge\n\n\nMedian length of ICU stay (alive at ICU discharge)\n\n13 vs 15 days\n\n\nMedian hospital length of stay\u00a0(alive at hospital discharge)\n\n28 vs 28 days\n\n\nExercise capacity based on median metres for 6 min walk test\n\n195 vs 173 at hospital discharge\n293 vs 255 at 3 months\n374 vs 321 at 6 months\n\n\nMean Functional status (Functional Independence Measure)\n\n70 vs 64 at ICU discharge\n113 vs 108 at hospital discharge\n116 vs 111 at 3 months\n118 vs 117 at 6 months\n\n\nMean hand grip strength\n\n14 vs 15 at ICU discharge\n19\u00a0vs 22 at hospital discharge\n25 vs 24 at 3 months\n29 vs 24 at 6 months\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\nMedian (IQR) no of days from enrolment to the first day when physical rehabilitation was received was 3 (1-6 days) in both groups\nMedian time (IQR) receiving physical rehabilitation on ICU: intervention group 161 minutes (67-273) vs standard care group 86 (31-139)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn this study, ICU based physical rehabilitation did not appear to improve physical outcomes at 6 months compared with standard physical rehabilitation\n\nStrengths\n\nRegistered with ISRCTN (20436833)\nProtocol published a priori\nPretrial power calculation\nLarge range of general critical care patients included\nMulti-centre study (although limited to 3 centres in the north of England)\nDelivery of rehabilitation in the control group\nProlonged follow up of 6 months\nStudy outcomes at hospital discharge and at 3 and 6-month follow-up were assessed by research nurses who were blinded to the treatment group\nTimings for characteristics of physical rehabilitation (functional retraining, strengthening and both) were recorded\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNumber of sites\nLack of 7-day rehabilitation interventions\nStudy outcomes at ICU discharge were assessed by the research physiotherapists who were unblinded to the treatment group\nThe original (and registered) version of the protocol listed 48\u201372 hours for the inclusion time but the upper limit was removed 2 months into recruitment as the time window proved too narrow and eligible patients were being missed, especially at weekends\nThe majority of treatment days in the standard care group included less than the target of 30 min physical rehabilitation, with 82% of treatment days including 20 min or less\nThe PCS measure of the SF-36 may not have been sensitive to change as it includes scoring coefficients from all 8 domains of the SF-36, including the negative scoring coefficients \u2018role emotional\u2019 and \u2019emotional well-being\u2019, which may not have been affected by the intervention\n77 patients (25% of total participants) were lost to follow up\nOver 2 years from follow up data being available to publication. Practice may have changed during this period\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn this study, delivering more ICU-based physical rehabilitation did not appear to improve physical outcomes at 6 months\nPatient tolerance, a non 7-day ICU rehabilitation service, poor compliance with the minimum time for sessions in the standard care group, and high loss of patients to follow up, are important confounders\nFuture work might concentrate on individualised, structured rehabilitation programme and optimising sedation protocols to facilitate these sessions. We also need a better understanding of the varying recovery trajectories after critical illness and the impact of psychological rehabilitation\n\nExternal Links\n\n[open access]\u00a0Intensive versus standard physical rehabilitation therapy in the critically ill (EPICC): a multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial\n[further reading] NICE CG83: Rehabilitation after critical illness in adults\n[further reading] REVIVE: The Bottom Line\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Steve Mathieu\nSummary date: 15th August 2017\nPeer-review editor: Adrian Wong\n\n\n"
