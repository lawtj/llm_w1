Intensive Care Medicine 2018; 44 (7): 1115-1129. doi: 10.1007/s00134-018-5245-2\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients discharged from a general ICU, is discharge \u201cout-of-hours\u201d compared to discharge \u201cin-hours\u201d associated with subsequent in-hospital mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nPatients discharged from ICU remain at significant risk of in-hospital death, with\u00a0mortalities reported\u00a0between 4 \u2013 13% in studies\nDischarges from ICU occasionally occur \u201cout of hours\u201d, when staff and facilities have reduced availability; this is sometimes due to bed pressures\nThere are concerns that \u201cout of hours\u201d discharge leads to worse care and thus increased mortality; conversely, patients considered fit for \u201cout of hours\u201d discharge may actually be low risk and therefore have a reduced hospital mortality\nPrevious research on the topic has been conflicting- the most recent analysis was conducted by ANZICS and suggested that when severity of illness was corrected for, \u201cout of hours\u201d discharge had no effect on mortality\n\nDesign\n\nSystematic review and meta-analysis\nRegistered with PROSPERO, followed PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines where applicable\n2 authors performed searches in Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Library, and Opengray\nAdditional keyword and citation searches from identified studies using Medline and Web of Knowledge\n2 searches performed- general search for all factors associated with post ICU mortality or readmission, and a specific search on out of hours discharges\nData summarised using a random effects meta-analysis\nBetween study variance computed using DerSimonian and Laird method\nStudy quality and risk of bias assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale\nPre-specified sensitivity analyses by omitting studies of different quality/risk of bias\nDisagreements between two reviewers resolved by discussion or referral to a third party\nPublication bias assessed by visual inspection of funnel plot and Egger\u2019s regression\nHeterogeneity of studies assessed using chi-squared test and I-squared statistic\n\nTrials Included\n\nSearch up to and including 12 June 2017\n1961 papers identified\n\n329 reviewed at abstract\n18 studies (14 papers, 4 conference abstracts) passed final screening for mortality analysis with 1,191,178 patients included\n\n9 single centre and 9 multi-centre\nStudy size range: 296 to 263,082 patients\nStudy duration range: 5 months to 9 years\nICU admission periods spanned 1994-2014\n\n\n11 studies passed final screening for readmission analysis with 1,156,904 patients included\n\n\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria for studies:\n\nReport in-hospital and/or ICU readmission rates for all patients >=16 years discharged alive from a general, surgical or mixed ICU to a lower level of in-hospital care\nReport these outcomes separately for patients discharged out-of-hours and in-hours\nFollow patients to hospital discharge\nProspective or retrospective\nAll publication languages with no date restrictions\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nSpecialist intensive care populations (cardiac, neuro, liver)\nStudies that separated weekday from weekend, but did not separate in hours from out of hours\nData duplicated in larger study\n\n\nOnly 2/18 trials fully reported baseline characteristics\n\nComparator\n\nDischarge \u201cout-of-hours\u201d\n\nVariable definition, starting between 1600-2200 and ending between 0559 and 0900\n\n\n\nControl\n\nDischarge \u201cin-hours\u201d\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Significant association between out-of-hours discharge and In-hospital mortality\n\nPooled relative risk estimate\u00a01.39 (95% CI 1.24-1.57; p<0.0001)\nAdjusted odds ratio (8 studies): 1.33 (95% CI 1.30-1.36; p=0.073)\nOut-of-hours discharge was associated with significant increases in mortaliy for all definitions of out-of-hours\nOverall heterogeneity was high (I-squared 90.1%), mainly arising from differences in study size\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nSignificant association between out-of-hours discharge and ICU readmission (11 studies)\n\nPooled relative risk estimate 1.30 (95% CI 1.19-1.42, p<0.0001)\n\n\n5 out of 7 studies found significantly higher severity of illness at admission in the out-of-hours groups\n2 out of 8 studies found patients discharged at night were significantly younger\n\n\nPost-hoc analysis: sub-group analysis based on geographical areas (UK, Europe, Australasia, Americas, Asia)\n\nEffect of out-of-hours discharge on mortality remained for studies based in UK, Europe, Australiasia, North and South America. No significant difference found in single small study based in Asia\nEffect of out-of-hours discharge on readmission:\n\nRemained for studies based in\n\nAustralasia RR 1.18 (95% CI 1.09-1.28)\nEurope RR 3.02 (95% CI 2.41-3.79)\nAmericas RR 1.14 (95% CI 1.07-1.21)\n\n\nBorderline for studies based in\n\nUK RR 1.42 (95% CI 1.00-2.02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nOut-of-hours discharge from ICU is associated with substantial increase in subsequent in-hospital mortality and ICU readmission\n\nStrengths\n\nImportant clinical question with a patient centred outcome\nPredefined, registered and published study protocol\nMultiple techniques used to minimise heterogeneity\nLarge patient dataset, multi-national\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAll the studies included, bar one are retrospective cohort studies- they can only demonstrate association, not causation\nSignificant heterogeneity between trials demonstrated by an I-squared statistic of 0.9\n\nHeterogeneity seen in study size, correction for confounders, and definition of out of hours\n\n\n9/18 of the trials were single centre -further reducing external validity\nA different scoring system was used to assess trials than had been planned in the protocol\nAbsence of data in many of included studies, combined with different measures of illness severity used, prevented post-hoc analysis to investigate whether differences between in-hours and out-of-hours populations accounted for differences in outcome.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis meta-analysis of a heterogeneous set of mostly retrospective trials, showed a significant\u00a0association between \u201cout-of-hours\u201d discharge from ICU and mortality. ICU re-admission was also significantly associated with out-of-hours discharge\nDecisions made to discharge patients \u201cout of hours\u201d will continue to occur, especially in environments where ICU capacity does not match demand\nHospital systems should be examined to try and minimize\u00a0discharges out-of-hours\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Out-of-hours discharge from intensive care, in-hospital mortality and intensive care readmission rates: a systematic review and meta-analysis\n[further reading]\u00a0Core Standards for Intensive Care Units\n[further reading]\u00a0Study protocol\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Segun Olusanya\nSummary date: 15th September 2018\nPeer-review editor: Dave Slessor\n\n\n"
