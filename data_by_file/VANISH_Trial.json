JAMA. 2016;316(5):509-518. doi:10.1001/jama.2016.10485\nClinical Question\n\nDoes early vasopressin use reduce the risk of kidney failure in patients with septic shock compared with norepinephrine?\n\nDesign\n\nFactorial (2\u00d72) multicenter, double blind, randomised controlled trial\nPatients were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups on a 1:1:1:1 basis with variable block size randomisation (4 and 8) using computer-generated numbers, stratified by center\nIntention to treat analysis\nA sample size of 400 provided 80% power to detect a 20% to 25% relative reduction of risk of developing kidney failure if treated with vasopressin compared with norepinephrine, assuming an overall incidence of acute kidney failure of 30-50% and a significance level of 0.05\n\nSetting\n\n18 adult general ICU\u2019s\nFebruary 2013 \u2013 May 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\u00a0Adult patients (\u226516 years) who had sepsis (2 of 4 systemic inflammatory response criteria due to known or suspected infection) and who required vasopressors despite adequate intravenous fluid resuscitation. Enrollment into the trial within 6 hours\nExclusion:\u00a0patients who had received a previous continuous infusion of vasopressors during this ICU admission;\u00a0requirement for systemic steroid treatment (e.g adrenal insufficiency or regular systemic steroid therapy within the last 3 months);\u00a0end-stage kidney failure; known mesenteric ischaemia; Raynaud phenomenon; systemic sclerosis; other vasospastic disease;\u00a0known pregnancy\n421 patients were randomised of which 409 patients were included in the study\n\nIntervention\n\nOpen labelled vasopressor was permitted for up to 6 hours before enrolment to this study. Once study drug one was commenced, the open labelled vasopressor was weaned off as quickly as possible\n\nStudy drug 1\n\nVasopressin (titrated up to 0.06 U/min) or Norepinephrine (titrated up to 12 \u03bcg/min)\n\nadministered via a central venous catheter\ntitrated to maintain the target mean arterial pressure 65 to 75 mm Hg, but this could be altered by the treating physician\n\n\n\nStudy drug 2\n\nHydrocortisone (50mg 6 hourly and then weaned) or Placebo\n\nstudy drug 2 was administered once the maximum infusion rate of study drug 1 was reached\nadministered as an intravenous bolus every 6 hours for 5 days, every 12 hours for 3 days, and then once daily for 3 days\nstudy drug 2 could be weaned more quickly if the shock had already resolved\n\n\n\nIn all groups\n\n\n\n\nIf the patient was still hypotensive after the first dose of study drug 2 then additional open-label catecholamine vasopressors could be administered\nOpen-label catecholamine vasopressors were reduced first and only once the patient was weaned off open-label vasopressors was study drug 1 then reduced\n\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: the number of days alive and free of kidney failure (defined by AKIN group stage 3) separated into two outcome measures:\n\n28 day survivors who never developed kidney failure: no difference between groups\n\nvasopressin + hydrocortisone: 56.8%\nvasopressin + placebo: 57.1%\nNorepinephrine + hydrocortisone: 59.7%\nNorepinephrine + placebo: 59.2%\nVasopressin vs. Norepinephrine absolute difference: -2.3 [95% CI -13.0 to 8.5]\n\n\nmedian number of days alive and free of kidney failure for those patients that did not survive and/or who experienced kidney failure\n\nvasopressin + hydrocortisone: 5 days (IQR 0-23)\nvasopressin + placebo: 12 days (IQR 1-25)\nNorepinephrine + hydrocortisone: 13 days (IQR 0-25)\nNorepinephrine + placebo: 14 days (IQR 1-24)\nVasopressin vs. Norepinephrine absolute Difference: \u22124 days [95% CI \u221211 to 5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSecondary outcomes: Fewer patients required renal replacement therapy in the vasopressin group compared with the\u00a0norepinephrine group. These patients were mostly the non-survivors\nOther secondary outcomes: no significant difference between groups for:\n\n28 day, ICU or hospital mortality rates\nKidney failure rate\nUse of inotropes and shock reversal\nMean SOFA scores\nDuration of mechanical ventilation\nICU and hospital length of stay\nSerious adverse events (including digital or mesenteric ischaemia, life-threatening arrhythmia and acute coronary syndrome)\n\n10.7% in the vasopressin group vs 8.3% in the norepinephrine group; difference, 2.5% [95% CI, \u22123.3% to 8.2%]\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAmong adults with septic shock,the early use of vasopressin compared with norepinephrine did not improve the number of kidney failure\u2013free days\n\nStrengths\n\nAn important clinical question comparing vasoactive drugs and the interaction of corticosteroids in patients with septic shock\nDrug ampoules were masked by overlabeling on the body and neck of normal drug ampoules. Matching placebo ampoules were used\nAll clinical staff and researchers were blinded\nThe baseline characteristics of the groups were well matched for APACHE II score, co-morbidities (including risk of renal injury such as pre-exisiting chronic kidney disease and diabetes), median fluid volume received in the first 4 hours and infection source (primarily lung)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nTiming of initiation of renal replacement therapy and levels of haemodynamic monitoring were not controlled, other than specifying that sites should follow the international guidelines\nShort time outcomes (28 day and hospital mortality) were assessed and therefore any long-term differences between treatment groups cannot be assessed\nNo health economic analysis \u2013 the lower rate of renal replacement therapy in the vasopressin-treated patients could be important\n72% of patients received study drug 2. Only 35% of patients received steroid treatment. The power to assess an interaction between steroids and vasopressors, particularly vasopressin is therefore limited\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nEarly vasopressin maintains blood pressure and reduces the requirement for norepinephrine and renal replacement therapy. However, vasopressin does not reduce the number of renal replacement free days or mortality rate, and there was no clinical interaction with corticosteroids\n\nExternal Links\n\n[abstract]\u00a0Effect of Early Vasopressin vs Norepinephrine on Kidney Failure in Patients With Septic Shock:\u00a0The VANISH Randomized Clinical Trial\n[trial protocol]\u00a0Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of VAsopressin versus Noradrenaline as Initial therapy in Septic sHock (VANISH)\n[Podcast] VANISH.
