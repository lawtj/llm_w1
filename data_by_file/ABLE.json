NEJM 2015; 372:1410-1418. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1500704\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients requiring blood, does transfusion with \u201cfresh\u201d RBC\u2019s (stored for 8 days or less) compared with standard issue RBCs (stored 2-42 days) reduce 90 day mortality?\n\nDesign\n\n\nMulticenter, randomised controlled trial\nRandomisation occurred by a centralised computer with stratification according to study site\nPatients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two study groups with the use of permuted blocks of varying sizes of 6, 8 or 10\nIntention to treat analysis\nInterim analyses occurred after each consecutive group of 500 patients had been followed for 90 days\nEstimated that 2266 patients was required for the study to be 90% powered to detect an absolute difference in mortality of 5% from a baseline mortality of 25%\n\nSetting\n\n64 tertiary care intensive care units in Canada and Europe\n\n26 Canada, 20 UK, 10 France, 7 Netherlands, 1 Belgium\n\n\nMarch 2009 \u2013 May 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nPatients administered RBC transfusion up to seven days post ICU-admission\nAnticipated length of mechanical ventilation of at least 48 hours\n\n\n\n\nExclusion: < 18 years; RBC transfusion prior to ICU admission; terminal illness with life expectancy < 3 months; undergone elective cardiac surgical care during the same hospitalisation; futility; refusal to receive transfusion; intensivist refused participation in study; no available RBCs in the blood bank with a storage time of 7 days or less; requirement of more than one unit of uncross-matched blood; patients requiring specifically matched blood due to autoantibodies\n\n\n2510 patients randomised of whom outcome data available for 2430\n\nbaseline characteristics were similar in both groups\nmean APACHE 21.8\nmean length of ICU stay 2.4 days\nmostly medical (71%) and emergency patients (96.7%)\nmost required invasive ventilation (97.4%) and vasoactive support (62.8%)\nmean pretransfusion Hb was 7.7g/dl\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n\u2018Fresh\u2019 blood transfusion \u2013 stored for 8 days or less\n\n1211 patients\nprotocol specified that if red cells < 8 days old were not available then the freshest compatible red cells were issued. The average duration of storage was 6.1 +/- 4.9 days\n\n84% received only RBCs stored for <8 days\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard blood transfusion \u2013 stored 2 \u2013 42 days\n\n1219 patients\nthe oldest compatible red cells were issued. The average duration of storage was 22.0 +/- 8.4 days\n\n\n\nFor both intervention and control groups:\n\n\nAll blood was leukoreduced before storage and suspended in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGM)\nLocal guidelines and practice for bedside transfusion were adopted\nAll decisions regarding patient care was at the discretion of the attending physicians and the clinical team\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: 90 day mortality\n\n448 patients (37%) vs. 430 patients (35%) (Absolute Risk Difference 1.7%; 95% CI -2.1-5.5)\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: No statistical difference between the groups in any of the outcomes\n\ntime to death in ICU, in hospital and by day 28\nmajor illness including MODS, ARDS, heart failure, cardiac ischaemia or MI, DVT or PE\nduration of respiratory support\nduration of haemodynamic suppport\nduration of renal support\nlength of stay in the hospital\ntransfusion reactions\n\n\nSubgroup analysis: No difference\n\n90d mortality in the patients who received a transfusion (excluded 94 patients who did not actually receive blood\n90d mortality in the patients who only received blood that had been stored for < 8 days vs those that had received blood stored for more than 7 days\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nTransfusion of fresh red cells, as compared with standard-issue red cells, did not decrease the 90-day mortality among critically ill patients\n\nStrengths\n\nConcealment of the age of the red cells by an opaque sticker affixed over the expiration and collection dates\nBlood transfusion technologists refrained from releasing information on storage duration to all clinical and research personnel\nProtocol, including details of trial conduct and the statistical analysis plan was published a priori\nOnly 3.9% of patients lost to follow up. This was less than the number anticipated when the study was planned\nThe rate of adherence to the transfusion protocol was 95.4%\n\nWeaknesses\n\n94 patients (3.9%) did not receive any blood transfusion. This has been considered in the sub-group analysis\nLack of uniform guideline or protocol across centres for transfusion. However, a pragmatic study and this is acknowledged in the manuscript\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study shows that fresh blood which has been stored for < 8 days is no better than blood stored up to 42 days. Transfusion triggers and processes for safe administration of blood are probably more important\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract]\u00a0Age of Transfused Blood in Critically Ill Adults\n[further reading] Transfusion Literature Summaries\n[further reading] Effects of Red-Cell Storage Duration on Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery\nfurther reading] Is fresher blood better?
