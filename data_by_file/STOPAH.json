How frequently did this happen? This possibly limits generalisability.\n\u2018Statistical significance\u2019 only demonstrated after extensive multivariate post-hoc analysis \u2014 this should not be considered a certain conclusion\nFunding limitations meant that not all patients were followed-up for 90-day and 1-year outcomes \u2014 study terminated after last recruited patient followed-up to 28-day outcome\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis study was under-powered to demonstrate clinically relevant effects\nHowever, it suggests strongly with a low risk of bias that pentoxifylline 400mg daily for 28 days has no beneficial effect whilst prednisolone 40mg daily for 28 days may be beneficial for short-term outcomes but not for medium or long-term outcomes\nFrom these data (with wide confidence intervals that cross the null hypothesis line)\n\nPrednisolone NNT (28-day mortality) is 23\nPrednisolone NNH (serious adverse infection) is 16\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0STOPAH: Prednisolone or Pentoxifylline for Alcoholic Hepatitis\n[study protocol]\u00a0STOPAH study protocol\n[videocast] STOPAH\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 5 May 2015\nPeer-review editor: @DavidSlessor\n\n\n\n"
