N Engl J Med 2014; 371:1983-93. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1404393\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with severe pancreatitis, does early enteral feeding compared with on-demand feeding reduce death or major infection?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised-controlled superiority trial\nTwo groups of patients in a 1:1 ratio\nRandomisation performed centrally and stratified for severity and treatment centre\nTreating clinicians non-blinded\nOutcome adjudicators blinded to patient group\nSample size of 208 patients calculated to give 80% power to detect a reduction in primary outcome from 40% (on demand feeding) to 22% (early enteric feeding) based on previous data\n\nSetting\n\nSix university medical centres and thirteen large teaching hospitals in the Netherlands\nAugust 2008 \u2013 June 2012\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Adults who were predicted to have severe pancreatitis\n\nPancreatitis was diagnosed based on two or more of:\n\nTypical abdominal pain\nCharacteristic findings on cross-sectional abdominal imaging\nSerum lipase or amylase more than three times upper limit of normal\n\n\nSeverity\n\nAPACHE II \u2265 8\nImrie or modified Glasgow score \u2265 3\nCRP over 150mg/l within 24 hours of admission\n\n\n\n\nExclusion: Recurrent acute or chronic pancreatitis; Pancreatitis due to ERCP or malignancy; Home enteral or parenteral nutrition; Pregnancy; Assessed more than 24 hours after presentation; Presented more than 96 hours after symptom onset\n867 patients screened, 208 enrolled and randomised, 205 analysed (3 incorrectly diagnosed)\n\nIntervention\n\n\u201cEarly\u201d group:\n\nNasojejunal tube placed within 24 hours of randomisation and feeding commenced\nTubes placed endoscopically or radiologically\nFeeding was started at 20ml/hr for the first 24 hours, then 45ml/hr from 24-48 hours, then 65ml/hr from 48-72 hours, and full feeding based on actual body weight after this\nIf symptoms of delayed passage developed, the feeding rate was decreased by 50%, and gradually increased again the following day, but stopped if symptoms worsened\nWhen patients were able to tolerate an oral diet, tube feeding was gradually stopped and replaced\n\n\n\nControl\n\n\u201cOn-demand\u201d group:\n\nOral diet was provided at 72 hours\nSupplementation by tube feeding after\u00a0further\u00a024 hours if unable to tolerate oral intake\nPrior to this received only IV fluids unless they requested oral food\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nComposite outcome of death or major infection within 6 months showed no statistically significant difference\n\nEarly group: 30%\nOn-demand group: 27%\nAbsolute risk increase: 3% (95% CI -9 to 15)\nNNH: 36\np-value: 0.76\n\n\n\n\nDeath within six months was not\u00a0significant statistically difference (11% early vs 7% on-demand, p=0.33)\nMajor infection within six months (pneumonia, bacteraemia, infected pancreatic necrosis)\u00a0was not\u00a0significant statistically difference\u00a0(25% early vs 26% on-demand, p=0.87)\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nDays to full oral diet was significantly reduced in on-demand group (9 days early vs 6 days on-demand, p=0.001)\nRate of NJ tube placement was significantly higher in early group (100% early vs 31% on-demand)\nNo significant difference in:\n\nNecrotising pancreatitis (62%)\nRate of ITU admission\nFrequency of gastrointestinal events\nLength of SIRS\n\n\n\n\nPost hoc analyses showed no significant primary outcome difference for:\n\nThe most unwell patients (APACHE \u2265 13)\nThose who already had SIRS at randomisation\nBMI under 25 or \u2265 35\nHealth care utilisation (except with regards tube placement)\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nEarly enteral feeding in these patients did not improve outcomes when compared to delayed on-demand feeding at 72 hours\nThis result disagrees with current guidelines which advise feeding to provide a protective effect on intestinal integrity and systemic nutritional status\nIt was unusual for tube feeding to be required\n\nStrengths\n\nSucceeded in randomising the treatment of a large number of patients with severe illness.\nChosen outcomes are clinically important\nThe statistical methods are valid and well-illustrated\nLong follow-up\nLow drop-out rate\nInteresting result with potential to change practice\n\nWeaknesses\n\nMay have been too small and underpowered\nFeeding may also been initiated too late or too gently in disease process\nScoring systems poor at predicting eventual severity so cases of non-severe pancreatitis may have been included\nUnblinded treating clinicians\nNJ tubes used, when nasogastric tubes are easier to place and may be as effective\nNot able to inform management of other forms of pancreatitis\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAllowing patients with severe pancreatitis three to four days to initiate oral intake appears to be safe and effective\nThis can reduce the discomfort, cost and complications associated with tube feeding in these patients\nAlthough well-conducted this was a relatively small trial, and future data may change this picture\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[Article] Early versus On-Demand Nasoenteric Tube Feeding in Acute Pancreatitis\n[Further reading]\u00a0Research and Reviews 63\u00a0by LITFL\n[Further reading]\u00a0Nutrition in severe pancreatitis: none at all (for 3 days) worked fine\u00a0by\u00a0PulmCCM\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: John Kiely\nSummary date: 12 June 2015\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n\n"
