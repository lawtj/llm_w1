Differences in population and treatment may limit the external validity.\n\nThe maximum dopamine dose used was lower than recommended in our local guidelines\nThe fluid boluses were given more slowly than our local guidelines recommend (20min vs. 5 min)\nThe duration that peripheral dopamine and adrenaline was continued for was longer than our standard practice (20.4hrs in dopamine group and 36.5hrs in adrenaline group)\n\n\nStaff may have been able to guess allocation group due to difference in flow rates. However a similar proportion of patients in each group had the study drug stopped due to non-responsiveness and were then all started on open-label adrenaline (36.5% of patients in the dopamine group vs. 33.3% in the adrenaline group)\nStudy stopped early after finding 13.6% difference in mortality, which is less than the 15% difference the study was powered at\nTrial not registered on clinical trial.gov\nMiscalculation of hospital acquired infections in adrenaline group. Reported as 4 out of 57 patients \u2013 2.3%. However 4 out of 57 patients is 7%.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe single centre randomised controlled trial in Brazil, demonstrated an increased mortality when dopamine, compared with adrenaline, was used to treat paediatric patients with septic shock. Patients treated with dopamine had a longer time until they were fully resuscitated, they had a greater need for renal replacement therapy, and greater number of hospital acquired infections. Further multi-centre trials are urgently needed to confirm these findings.\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Double-Blind Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial of Dopamine Versus Epinephrine as First-Line Vasoactive Drugs in Pediatric Septic Shock\n[Further reading]\u00a0Core EM review by @emswami\n[Further Reading]\u00a0Southampton PICU sepsis algorithm\n[Further reading]\u00a0Southampton PICU guideline on septic shock\n[A similar trial] Double-Blind Randomized Clinical Trial Comparing Dopamine and Epinephrine In Paediatric Fluid-Refractory\u00a0Hypotensive Septic Shock\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @davidslessor\nSummary date: 29th December 2015\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@stevemathieu75\n\n\n"
