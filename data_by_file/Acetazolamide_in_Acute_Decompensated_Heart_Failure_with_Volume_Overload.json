NEJM 2022; 387:1185 \u2013 1195. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2203094\nClinical Question\n\nIn adult patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), does the addition of acetazolamide to loop diuretics improve decongestion by day 3?\n\nBackground\n\nFluid overload has been independently shown to increase mortality in the general ICU population\nA recent registry study of nearly 50,000 ICU admissions reported that around half of all ICU patients are administered diuretics during their stay \u2013 in 95% of instances patients receive furosemide\nThe ASCEND-HF trial showed that a high proportion of patients with ADHF were admitted to a critical care area (ICU or CCU) and re-admission rates are high (50% within 6 months)\nReadmission is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, however optimal strategies for decongestion are yet to be determined\n\nWhat did they do?\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, 519 adult patients admitted to hospital with ADHF and clinical signs of fluid overload alongside a raised BNP were randomised\nImportant exclusion criteria included current use of acetazolamide or an SGLT2 inhibitor, hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg), a GFR < 20 ml /min\nTreatment with IV furosemide > 80 mg (or equivalent) during index hospitalization was not allowed prior to randomisation\nPatients were randomised in 1:1 ratio to receive either 500mg dose of acetazolamide or matching placebo\n\nThis was given for 3 days or until complete decongestion (clinical absence of fluid overload (oedema, pleural effusions and ascites)\n\n\nLoop diuretics were given at double maintenance dose (as a bolus and then split into two doses per day for the next 2 days)\n\nMedian daily maintenance dose of furosemide was 60mg across all groups\n\n\nTreatment could be escalated according to a protocol if urine output insufficient and ongoing evidence of fluid overload\nBaseline characteristics were balanced between groups\n\nWhat did it show?\n\n\u00a0Increased rates of successful decongestion in acetazolamide group (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.17 \u2013 1.82)\nThis seemed to persist to hospital discharge in an exploratory analysis\nIncreased diuresis (500mls at 48 hours, 95% CI 200 to 800mls) and natriuresis on day 2 in acetazolamide group\nNo difference in mortality or length of hospital stay\nNo difference in adverse events\n\nHow does it fit into other evidence?\n\nThe DOSE trial was a 2\u00d72 factorial trial that randomized patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) to a high or low dose furosemide strategy as either a bolus or continuous infusion\nNo significant difference in patient\u2019s perceived symptoms or renal function was noted between the groups, however across all groups only ~15% were free from congestion at 72 hours\nThis study shows that decongestion can be improved with the addition of acetazolamide, however, benefit with respect to patient focused outcomes have yet to be shown\nUltrafiltration as a strategy to decongest ADHF patients has also been studied (UNLOAD, CARESS-HF) with differing results with respect to success of decongestion and hospital readmissions\n\nExternal Links\n\narticle Acetazolamide in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure with Volume Overload\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker\nSummary date: 30th May 2023\nPicture by: fietzfotos/Pixabay\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
