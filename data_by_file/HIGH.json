The HIGH Randomized Clinical Trial\nAzoulay E et al. JAMA October 2018; DOI:10.1001/jama.2018.14282\nClinical Question\n\nIn immunocompromised patients\u00a0with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF), does the use of high-flow oxygen compared with standard oxygen therapy, reduce 28-day mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nEarly small randomised trials (1, 2) suggested that the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) may reduce the need for endotracheal intubation and improve outcomes in immunocompromised patients with AHRF\nIn a larger more recent trial, NIV did not improve outcomes vs standard oxygen. However, the trial was underpowered for its primary outcome given the lower than expected mortality in the control arm\nThe FLORALI trial found improved ICU and 90-day mortality with the use of high-flow nasal oxygen compared to other oxygen delivery methods in a broadly defined group of patients with AHRF\nWhether high-flow nasal oxygen improves outcomes specifically for immunocompromised patients with AHRF remains unclear\n\nDesign\n\nMulticentre randomised parallel-group trial\nNon-blinded given the nature of the intervention\n1:1 assignment\nBlock randomisation\nAllocation concealment maintained through the use of an electronic system\nStratification according to study centre, oxygen flow rate at randomisation, need for vasopressors, and time since ICU admission\nPower calculation\n\nBased on an expected 28-day mortality of 30% in the standard oxygen arm and 20% in the high-flow oxygen arm\n779 patients targeted to provide the trial with a 90% power to detect a decrease in 28-day mortality (alpha set at 5%)\n\n\nIntention to treat analysis\nThe protocol was initially designed as a non-inferiority trial with different secondary endpoints. At the request of a grant review jury (in part in reaction to the results of the FLORALI study), the protocol was modified to a superiority trial. Both the initial and the revised protocol are provided in the published data supplement.\n\nSetting\n\n32 French hospitals (24 university-affiliated and 8 non-university-affiliated)\nData collected: May 2016 to December 2017\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria: Immunocompromised adult patients with AHRF\n\n18 years of age or older\nAHRF defined as any of the following: PaO2 < 60 mmHg, SpO2 < 90% on room air, respiratory rate (RR) > 30 breaths/minute, labored breathing, respiratory distress\nNeed for oxygen flow \u2265 6 L/min\nKnown immunosuppression defined as any of the following: use of \u2265 3 months of > 0.5 mg/kg/day steroids, use of other immunosuppressant drugs, solid organ transplantation, solid tumour requiring chemotherapy in the last 5 years, haematologic malignancy regardless of the time of diagnosis, primary immunodeficiency\n\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nAIDS\nImminent death\nAnatomical factors precluding the use of nasal cannula\nHypercapnia (PaCO2 \u2265 50 mmHg)\nIsolated cardiogenic pulmonary edema\nPregnancy or breastfeeding\nSurgery within the last 6 days\nAbsence of coverage by the French statutory health care insurance system\n\n\n778 patients randomised, 2 patients withdrew consent\nBaseline characteristics were well matched\n\nMedian age 64 years\n33.3% women\n78.9% with underlying cancer (56.8% of which were a haematologic malignancy)\n57.9% receiving chemotherapy at the time of ICU admission\n14.9% with poor performance status\n63.8% enrolled on the day of ICU admission; 16% enrolled >=2 days after ICU admission\nMedian PaO2/FiO2 < 150 in both groups immediately prior to randomisation\nMedian SOFA score at randomisation 6\n11% received high-flow nasal oxygen prior to randomisation\nCause of AHRF\n\n41% bacterial pneumonia\n12% invasive fungal infection\n10% lung involvement from underlying disease\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nContinuous high-flow nasal oxygen (n=389)\n\ninitiated at 50 L/min and 1.0 FiO2. If SpO2 < 95%, flow increased to 60 L/min. FiO2 subsequently titrated to achieve SpO2 > 95%. The minimal flow rate during the first 3 days was 50 L/min\nHigh-flow nasal oxygen was weaned if the patient had improved clinical signs of respiratory distress, PaO2/FiO2 > 300, and could maintain SpO2 > 95% with < 6 L/min of standard O2\n\u2022 Patients returned to high-flow nasal oxygen for recurrent hypoxia\n376 patients received intervention as randomised\n1 patient withdrew consent and 12 patients did not receive treatment with high-flow due to discomfort\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNormal oxygen delivery (n=389)\n\nOxygen delivered via nasal prong or mask; with or without a reservoir and with or without a Venturi system\n\u2022 Flow set to achieve SpO2 > 95%\n\u2022 High-flow nasal oxygen allowed only for Do Not Intubate orders in patients for whom standard O2 had failed\n358 patients received intervention as randomised\n1 patient withdrew consent and 30 patients received high-flow\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nNIV only allowed for hypercapnia or pulmonary oedema\nStandardised criteria for invasive mechanical ventilation\nVentilator management followed consensus guidelines\nAll other management decisions were left to the treating clinician\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: 28-day all-cause mortality \u2013 no significant difference\n\n35.6% (intervention) vs. 36.1% (control)\nHR, 0.98 [95% C.I., 0.77 to 1.24], p = 0.94\nNo significant interaction between the intervention effect and any pre-defined subgroup\n\n\nSecondary outcomes (comparing intervention vs. control)\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nIntubation rate\n\n38.7% vs 43.8%\ncause-specific HR, 0.85 [95% C.I., 0.68 to 1.06], p = 0.17\n\n\nICU acquired infections\n\n10.0% vs. 10.6%\nabsolute risk difference -0.6 [95% C.I. -4.6% to 4.1%]\n\n\nICU length of stay\n\n8 vs. 6 days\nmean difference 0.6 days [95% C.I. -1.0 to 2.2]\n\n\n\u00a0ICU mortality\n\n31.7% vs. 31.4%\nmean difference 0.3 [95% C.I. -6.3 to 6.8]\n\n\nHospital length of stay\n\n24 vs. 27 days\nmean difference -2 days [95% C.I. -7.3 to 3.3]\n\n\nHospital mortality\n\n41.2% vs. 41.7%\nmean difference -0.5 [95% C.I. -7.5 to 6.4]\n\n\nCumulative incidence of mechanical ventilation, patient comfort (assessed using a visual analogic scale) or patient dyspnea (assessed using visual analogic scale)\n\n\nSignificantly reduced in the intervention group\n\nRespiratory rate after 6 hours\n\n25 breaths/min vs. 26 breaths/min\nmean difference, -1.8 [95% CI, -3.2 to -0.3]\n\n\n\n\nSignificantly increased in the intervention group\n\nPaO2/FiO2 until day 4\n\n150 vs. 119\nmean difference, 19.5 [95% CI, 4.4 to 13.6]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-hoc outcomes\n\nNo significant difference between groups in need for vasopressors and renal replacement therapy, median time from randomisation to intubation, mortality in intubated patients, decisions to limit treatment, 28-day mortality in patients with and without cancer as the cause of immunosuppression, and 90-day mortality\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nHigh-flow nasal oxygen does not decrease 28-day mortality compared to standard oxygen in immunocompromised patients with AHRF.\n\nStrengths\n\nAddresses a clinically relevant question\nThe largest trial to date on the subject\nTrial conducted at both academic and community hospitals, increasing the generalisability of the results\nBaseline characteristics were well balanced between the two study arms\nThe number of patients in the high-flow oxygen arm who crossed over to the standard oxygen arm was low (3%)\nNo patients were lost to follow-up during the study period\n\nWeaknesses\n\nWhile multicentre, the trial was performed only in France which may limit generalisability to other practice settings\nLack of blinding may have led to differential treatment between groups\nThe minimum allowable SpO2 in either arm was 95%. As the benefits of a conservative oxygenation threshold in the ICU become clear, the aggressive SpO2 target used in this trial seems increasingly out of line with best practice (although the harms of this approach \u2013 if any \u2013 should have been evenly balanced by randomisation)\nThe study hypothesis and protocol lumps a heterogeneous patient population under the common label of \u201cimmunocompromised\u201d and presumes this group shares a common physiologic response to different oxygen delivery devices. This conflation may mask benefits or harm to high-flow oxygen within specific patient sub-groups not expressly highlighted in the trial\nThe study protocol including many of the secondary endpoints was adjusted after initial submission (which the authors acknowledge in the manuscript)\n11% of patients received high-flow prior to randomisation and 8% of patients randomised to control group received high flow oxygen\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn a broadly defined group of immunocompromised patients with AHRF, the use of high-flow nasal oxygen did not reduce 28-day mortality compared to standard oxygen\nThis trial should allow clinicians to move away from prescriptive rules for oxygen delivery (e.g., all immunocompromised patients with AHRF must receive high-flow nasal oxygen) and towards individualised care guided by the clinical situation, available resources, and the patient\u2019s response to the chosen therapy\nBased on the strong physiologic rationale for the use of high-flow nasal oxygen in AHRF, the results of the FLORALI study, and several trials (1, 2) supporting the use of high-flow nasal oxygen to prevent post-extubation respiratory failure, I will continue to view high-flow nasal oxygen as a reasonable front-line therapy for immunocompromised patients with AHRF\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of High-Flow Nasal Oxygen vs Standard Oxygen on 28-day Mortality in Immunocompromised Patients with Acute Respiratory Failure.
