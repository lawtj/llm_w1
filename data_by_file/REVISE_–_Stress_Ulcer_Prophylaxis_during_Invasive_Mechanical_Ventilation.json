DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2404245\nClinical Question\n\nIn mechanically ventilated adults, does stress ulcer prophylaxis with intravenous pantoprazole (40 mg daily), compared with placebo (0.9% saline), reduce the occurrence of clinically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding at 90 days?\n\nBackground\n\nCritical illness is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal (GI) stress ulceration and consequent upper GI bleeding\nProphylactic proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) have been shown to reduce the risk of clinically significant bleeding in critical illness [SUP-ICU]\nIncreased mortality in a subgroup of the most severely ill patients in SUP-ICU (vs. placebo), as well as a trend towards increased mortality with PPI (vs. H2RA) in the PEPTIC trial, however, suggest that PPI use in critically ill patients may be associated with harm despite a reduction in UGI bleeding\nA meta-analysis (Wang, et al. 2020) demonstrated that PPI use may be associated with an increased risk of ventilator associated pneumonia (low certainty) and that harm from increased risk of C. Difficile infection cannot be excluded\n\nDesign\n\nRe-EValuating the Inhibition of Stress Erosions (REVISE trial)\nInternational, multi-centre randomised controlled trial\nWeb-based randomisation in 1:1 ratio\n\nPermuted blocks of undisclosed, variable size\nStratification by trial centre and prehospital receipt of acid suppression\n\n\nBlinding: treating clinicians, patients, research staff members, outcome adjudicators and biostatisticians blinded until completion of data analysis\nSample size calculation:\n\n4800 patients for 85% power to detect 1.5% difference in primary outcome\nAssuming baseline risk of 3% and \u03b1 = 0.05\n\n\nIntention to treat analysis\nPre-specified sensitivity and subgroup analyses\nSecondary and tertiary outcomes adjusted for multiple comparisons\n\nSetting\n\n68 hospitals in Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, Kuwait, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United States\nEnrolment between July 2019 and October 2023\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdults (\u226518 years old)\nReceiving mechanical ventilation in ICU\nExpected to remain ventilated beyond the calendar day after randomisation\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nDuration of mechanical ventilation \u226572 hours\nAcid suppression for active or high-risk of GI bleeding (e.g. current bleeding, peptic ulcer bleeding within 8 weeks, recent severe oesophagitis)\nPrior acid suppression in ICU (>1 daily dose equivalent of PPI or H2RA)\nDual anti-platelet therapy or antiplatelet agent and therapeutic anticoagulation\nContraindication to pantoprazole\n\n\n6221 patients eligible at time of screening \u2192 4900 randomised \u2192 4821 in final analysis\n\n79 excluded post-randomisation (consent withdrawn for 73 subjects)\n\n\nBaseline characteristics well balanced between groups\n\nComparing pantoprazole vs placebo groups:\n\nAge: 58 vs 58\nAPACHE II: 21.8 vs 21.7\nMale: 63.5% vs 63.8%\nPatient status\n\nMedical: 72.5% vs 73.5%\nTrauma: 15.3% vs 13%\nSurgical: 12.2% vs 13.5%\n\n\nAdmitting diagnostic category\n\nRespiratory: 31.1% vs 31.9%\nNeurologic: 21.8% vs 23%\nTrauma: 15.3% vs 13%\nCardiovascular: 9.6% vs 10.5%\nSepsis: 8.3% vs 8.3%\nGastrointestinal: 4.5% vs 4.5%\nMetabolic: 4.2% vs 3.7%\nRenal: 1.4% vs 1.3%\nOther medical: 1.6% vs 1.3%\nOther surgical: 2.4% vs 2.4%\n\n\nAcid suppression prior to hospitalisation:\n\nNone: 76.4% vs 77.1%\nPPI: 22.7% vs 22.3%\nH2RA: 0.6% vs 0.4%\n\n\nGlucocorticoid \u22651 week before randomisation: 35.4% vs 34.9%\nOrgan support\n\nInotrope or vasopressor infusion 69.5% vs 71.1%\nRenal-replacement therapy 6.3% vs 6.4%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nIntravenous pantoprazole 40mg daily (reconstituted with 0.9% sodium chloride)\n\nMedian 5 days of drug receipt\n\n\n\nControl\n\nMatched placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) with similar appearance\n\nMedian 5 days of drug receipt\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nPantoprazole or placebo administered for 90 days or until the discontinuation of mechanical ventilation\nCould also be discontinued in the event of pre-specified clinical indication (e.g. upper GI bleed) or contra-indication to PPI\nOther care and interventions at discretion of treating clinicians\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: clinically important upper GI bleeding in ICU (or requiring ICU readmission) at 90 days\n\nDefined as overt GI bleeding PLUS \u22651 of following within 24hrs:\n\nhaemodynamic change (decrease SBP/DBP/MAP \u226520 mmHg)\northostatic hypotension/tachycardia\ncommencement of vasopressor\nhaemoglobin decrement \u226520g/L over 24hrs\ntransfusion of \u22652 units packed RBC over 24hrs\nrequirement for therapeutic intervention\n\n\nSignificantly reduced risk in pantoprazole group:\n\nPantoprazole 25/2385 (1%) vs Placebo 84/2377 (3.5%)\n\nAbsolute difference: 2.5% (95% CI, 1.6 to 3.3)\nNNT 40\nHR: 0.3 (0.19 to 0.47;
