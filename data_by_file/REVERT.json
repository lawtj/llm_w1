The Lancet 2015; published online first 25th August 2015. DOI\u00a010.1016/S0140-6736(15)61485-4\n\u00a0Clinical Question\n\nDoes a modified Valsalva technique, incorporating a leg lift procedure, result in improved success in converting a supraventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm in patients presenting to the Emergency Department?\n\nDesign\n\n\nMulti-centre, randomised controlled trial\n\n\nPermuted block concealed allocation\n\n\nIntention to treat analysis\n\n\nTreating clinicians non-blinded. Investigators blinded to treatment allocation\n\nSample size of 372 patients calculated to give 80% power to detect an increase in primary outcome from 15% (stay sitting Valsalva) to 27% (lying down with leg lift Valsava)\n\nSetting\n\n\n10 Emergency Departments in UK (2 teaching and 8 district general hospitals)\n\nJan 2013 to Dec 2014\n\nBaseline characteristics were similar in both groups\n\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Patients over 18 years of age with supra ventricular tachycardia (regular, narrow complex tachycardia with QRS duration <0.12s on ECG)\nExclusion: Unstable patients with systolic blood pressure\u00a0 <90 mm Hg or an indication for immediate cardioversion; atrial fibrillation or flutter; suspected atrial flutter requiring a trial of adenosine; the presence of any contraindication to Valsalva manoeuvre (aortic stenosis, recent myocardial infarction, glaucoma, retinopathy), inability to performing a Valsalva manoeuvre, to lie flat, or have legs lifted (or any reason identified by the patient as to why this manoeuvre would cause discomfort or pain), third trimester pregnancy, or previous inclusion in this study.\n711 patients were screened, 433 patients enrolled and randomised, 428 analysed (5 excluded as repeat enrolment)\n\n\nIntervention\n\n\nModified Valsalva manoeuvre \u2013 lying down with leg lift Valsalva\nParticipants performed the standardised strain in the same semi-recumbent position but immediately at the end of the strain, were laid flat and had their legs raised by a member of staff to 45\u00b0 for 15 s. Participants were then returned to the semi-recumbent position for a further 45 s before re-assessment of cardiac rhythm, initially by 3-lead ECG.\n\n\nControl\n\n\nStandard Valsalva manoeuvre \u2013 stay sitting Valsalva\n\n\nParticipants, positioned semi-recumbent (at 45\u00b0) on a trolley, were directed to perform the standardised strain and remained in the same position for 60 s before reassessment of cardiac rhythm, initially by 3-lead ECG.\n\n\n\nIn both groups\n\n\n\nThe Valsalva manoeuvre strain was\u00a0standardised to a pressure of 40 mm Hg sustained for 15 s by forced expiration measured by aneroid manometer with the target pressure marked and visible to the participant and treating team\n\nIf sinus rhythm (SR) was not restored, participants were invited to undertake one further attempt at the allocated Valsalva manoeuvre\nA 12-lead ECG was recorded if return to sinus rhythm was achieved at 1 min after Valsalva manoeuvre, and 1 min after the second manoeuvre even if unsuccessful\nSubsequent management was at the discretion of the treating clinical team according to standard guidelines\n\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: presence of SR 1 min after Valsalva manoeuvre (confirmed by ECG)\n37 (17%)\u00a0in the standard Valsalva group vs 93 (43%) in the modified Valsalva group. Odds ratio [OR] 3\u00b77, 95% CI 2\u00b73\u20135\u00b78. P<0.0001 NNT 4.\n\nSecondary outcome: standard Valsalva group vs modified Valsalva group\n\nAdenosine given:\u00a0:148 (69%) vs 108 (50%) P=0.0002. NNT 5.3\nAny emergency anti-arrhythmic treatment: 171 (80%) vs 121 (57%) P=<0.0001\nDischarged home from emergency department: 146 (68%) vs 134 (63%) P=0.28\nAny adverse effect: 8 (4%) vs 13 (6%) P=0.32\n\nIncreased heart rate, hypotension or light headedness, nausea, electrograph captured events, musculoskeletal pain or other (headache, shortness of breath and cyanosis)\n\n\nMedian time in Emergency Department: 2.83 hours (1.95-3.62) vs 2.82 hours (1.95-3.77) P=0.31\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\nIn patients with supraventricular tachycardia, a modified Valsalva manoeuvre with leg elevation and supine positioning at the end of the strain should be considered as a routine first treatment, and can be taught to patients.\n\n\nStrengths\n\nThis is a very well designed, pragmatic study that has no cost impact but dramatically improves treatment success\nA training video was given to all participating centres\nAllocation concealment \u2013 local investigators were requested to date the seal of the envelope before they broke it. This is a sensible method to avoid any potential bias but ensuring the randomisation process is easily managed in a high acuity area\nAdequacy of the Valsalva technique was assessed and similar in both groups\nNo cross over occurred between patient groups\nOpportunity to improve information patients were provided. At\u00a0discharge, participants were given written instructions on how to perform both types of Valsalva manoeuvre themselves using a 10 mL syringe\u00a0and provided with the website address of the Arrhythmia Alliance, a patient support charity.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nEmergency physician analysing treatment response was non-blinded. However, all trial ECGs were retrospectively assessed by an independent cardiologist, masked to treatment allocation. Disagreement with the treating clinician\u2019s ECG interpretation was arbitrated by an independent electrophysiologist masked to treatment allocation\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe modified Valsalva technique is a simple, effective, cost-free and well tolerated postural modification to the standard Valsalva technique. This study supports the use of the modified Valsalva technique, over the \u00a0standard approach, as an early treatment for\u00a0haemodynamically stable\u00a0patients presenting with a supraventricular tachycardia\n\n\n\nConflict of interest The summary author\u2019s brother is a local collaborator for the trial\nExternal Links\n\n[article abstract] Postural modification to the standard Valsalva manoeuvre for emergency treatment of supraventricular tachycardias (REVERT) : a randomised controlled trial\n[supplementrary video] The modified Valsalva technique\n[commentary]\u00a0Supraventricular tachycardia: back to basics\n[blog]\u00a0JC The REVERT trial: Dip or doom for SVT in the Emergency Department?\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: @stevemathieu75\nSummary date: 7th September 2015\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\n\n\n\n"
