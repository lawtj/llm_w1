The GRECCO-19 Randomized Clinical\nTrial\nDeftereos et al, JAMA June 24, 2020;3(6):e2013136; doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.13136\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients hospitalised with symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019, does the administration of colchicine improve clinical & laboratory outcomes?\n\nBackground\n\nSince the arrival of COVID-19 onto the world stage of infectious disease there has been a series of rapidly performed trials seeking to pair up an evolving understanding of the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with knowledge of\nthe mechanism of drug effects. Some medications appear to have beneficial effects (Dexamethasone \u2013 RECOVERY. Remdesivir \u2013 ACTT-1) while others have yet to show promise\nThere has in addition been debate over the timing of administration and the target population of many of these agents\nColchicine is used as an anti-inflammatory drug in conditions such as gout, pericarditis and Mediterranean fever. It has inhibitory effects on WBC migration, IL 1 and 6, GM-CSF and possibly anti-thrombotic effect. The mechanism of these effects is not fully understood but is thought to be mediated via microtubule assembly\nCOVID-19 has documented pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic features\n\nDesign\n\nAn open-label, randomised control, multicentre trial\nRandomisation was computerised and performed off-site, using\n1:1 simple randomisation (R software version 3.6.2).\nAnalysis was by intention-to-treat (ITT)\nPower calculation\n\nAssuming a median event-free survival of 30 days and an accrual time of 30 days, 180 patients needed to have a 90% probability to detect a 50% reduction in the primary clinical end point, with a 5% false positive rate\n\n\nTrial funding was supported by ELPEN Pharmaceuticals, Acarpia Pharmaceuticals and Karian Pharmaceuticals, though it was stated that the funding sources had no role in the trial concept, design, management, data handling or writing of the manuscript. A number of the trial authors receive pharmaceutical grants and fees\nThe protocol was approved by the National Ethics Committee and the Hellenic National Organization for Medicines. All patients provided written informed consent before enrollment\nThe trial was reported according to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline\n\nSetting\n\nMulti-centre: 16 tertiary care hospitals in Greece\nPatient recruitment started on April 3, 2020, and was halted on April 27, 2020, due to slow enrollment because of the rapid flattening of the curve of COVID-19 cases in Greece\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria: Hospitalised adult patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed with rtPCR, and:\n\nTemperature of 37.5 \u00b0C or greater\n2 or more of the following:\n\nSustained coughing, sustained sore throat, anosmia and/or ageusia, fatigue and/or tiredness, PaO2 < 95 mm Hg on room air\n\n\n\n\nExclusion criteria: pregnancy or lactation, known hypersensitivity to colchicine, known hepatic failure, estimated GFR <20 mL/min/1.73 m2, cQT >=450 milliseconds, clinical assessment indicating that ventilatory support would be inevitable in the following 24 hours\n110 patients randomised, of whom 105 included in final analysis\nComparing baseline characteristics of intervention vs. control group\n\nWithdrew consent before the study: 2% vs. 7%\nMale: 56% vs. 60%\nMedian age: 63 vs. 65\nBMI: 27.3 vs. 27.7\nMedian time from admission to enrollment: 3 vs. 5 days\nPaO2 <95mmHg: 75% vs. 66%\nDiabetes: 16% vs. 24%\nHypertension: 40% vs 50%\nCoronary artery disease: 16% vs. 10%\nKnown immunosuppression: 5.5% vs. 2%\nConcomitant COVID-19 treatment:\n\nChloroquine or hydroxychloroquine: 100% vs. 96%\nAzithromycin: 93% vs. 92%\nLopinavir or ritonavir: 26% vs. 38%\nTocilizumab: 3.6% vs. 4.0%\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nColchicine, open label (n=55)\n\nLoading dose\n\n1.5mg + 0.5mg at 1hour if no adverse gastrointestinal effects were observed\nIn the case of azithromycin co-administration a single 1mg loading dose of colchicine was administered\n\n\nMaintenance dose\n\n0.5mg BD until hospital discharge or maximum of 21 days\nReduced to once daily if weight <60kg\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard care (n=50)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: comparing intervention vs. control group\n\nThere were 3 primary outcomes, two lab markers and one clinical\nPeak high sensitivity cardiac Troponin (hsTnT)\n\nNo significant difference with low values overall\n\n\nTime to CRP rising more than three times above normal\n\nNo significant difference and many patients already had high CRP levels at the time of enrolment.\n\n\nTime until 2 point deterioration on a 7-point WHO R&D Blueprint Ordinal Clinical Scale within 3 weeks of randomisation\n\nClinical primary end point (clinical deterioration) occurred significantly more often in control group\n\n1.8% vs. 14%, p=0.02, Odds ratio 0.11 (95% C.I. 0.01-0.96)\n\n\nCumulative event free 10 day survival \u2013 significantly greater in intervention group\n\n97% vs. 83%, p=0.03\n\n\nPatients who met primary clinical end point\n\nIn intervention group (n=1)\n\n1 intubated and ventilated and subsequently died\n\n\nIn control group (n=7)\n\n1 required non-invasive ventilation\n5 intubated and mechanically ventilated\n4 died\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes: comparing intervention vs. control group\n\nAll-cause mortality \u2013 no significant difference\nNeed for mechanical ventilation \u2013 no significant difference\nAdverse events \u2013 no significant differences apart from\n\nDiarrhoea \u2013 significantly increased in intervention group\n\n46% vs. 18%, p=0.003\n\n\n\n\nMedian hospital stay \u2013 no significant difference\n\n12 vs. 13 days\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n\u201cparticipants who received colchicine had statistically significant improved time to clinical deterioration compared with a control group that did not receive colchicine. However, the observed difference was based on a narrow margin of clinical significance; therefore, these observations should be considered hypothesis generating\u201d\n\nStrengths\n\nA well conducted trial that was quickly put together in challenging circumstances where information and patient numbers were rapidly changing\nA very thorough baseline characteristics comparison\nA multicentre (n=16) study of a tertiary care population\nNo patients were lost to follow up\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSmall sample size, the effect of which can clearly be seen in some of the confidence interval ranges\nThe trial was terminated early as recruitment numbers fell off as the COVID-19 incidence curve flattened in Greece. The required sample size was not met\nThe only primary outcome that showed any benefit was the clinical outcome of a WHO R&D Blueprint Ordinal Clinical Scale and it had a Fragility index = 1. So this is not robust data\nThis is a trial that is heavily sponsored by three pharmaceutical companies, though the authors state that those companies had no role in the trial design, management or reporting\nPower calculation was looking for a very optimistic target of a 50% reduction in the primary outcome. That\u2019s an optimistic target and many studies looking for a 10-20% benefit fail to do so\nThe study had 3 primary outcomes, two of which were not patient centred outcomes\nA large number of both clinical and laboratory data outcomes reported though some values were not recorded, such as IL-1 and 6. This is notable as the main proposed mechanism of action for colchicine is its anti-inflammatory activity\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis small trial demonstrates another easy-to-start treatment (supply, administration route) that may have a benefit at ward level in reducing the number of patients that deteriorate to the level of needing ICU admission, primarily due to need for ventilator support; i.e. possibly a useful surge/crisis therapy\nHowever, the study numbers are small, the absolute benefit numbers even smaller and the confidence intervals are wide. Additionally the one clinical benefit demonstrated had a Fragility Index of 1. So this rates as a hypothesis generating study, not a practice changer\nBased on this trial, I will not be chasing my pharmacist to check out the supply robustness of colchicine yet\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of Colchicine vs Standard Care on Cardiac and Inflammatory Biomarkers and Clinical Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized With Coronavirus Disease 2019 The GRECCO-19 Randomized Clinical Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0JAMA editorial\n[further reading]\u00a0Title and author\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Matthew Mac Partlin, @rollcagemedic\nSummary date: 20th July 2020\nPeer-review editor: @David Slessor\n\n\n"
