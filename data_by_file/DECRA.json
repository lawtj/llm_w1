NEJM, 2011; DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1102077\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients admitted to ICU with severe diffuse traumatic brain injury (TBI) and refractory raised intracranial pressure (ICP), does early decompressive craniectomy improve functional outcomes when compared with continued medical management?\n\nBackground\n\nTraumatic brain injury is a common reason for ICU admission and is associated with high morbidity and mortality.\nRaised intracranial pressure is an important cause of secondary brain injury and many patients with TBI have refractory raised ICP which does not respond to first tier medical interventions\nDecompressive craniectomy is used as a treatment for refractory raised ICP in TBI, with some retrospective trials suggesting a mortality benefit\nHowever, no large randomised-controlled trials had previously been conducted\n\nDesign\n\nInternational, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial\nRandomisation within 72 hours of injury\n\nTrigger for randomisation: refractory raised ICP \u2013 defined as ICP >20mmHg for 15 mins (continuous or intermittent) within 1 hour despite tier 1 interventions\nStratified according to centre and ICP monitoring technique\nRandomised in blocks of two or four patients\n\n\nTreating teams were non-blinded to allocation however outcomes were evaluated by three blinded assessors\n\nStructured telephone assessment used\n\n\nIntention-to-treat analysis\nOriginally designed to detect an increase in the proportion of favourable outcomes (defined as GOS-E of 5-8) from 30% to 50% (power of 80%) with a sample size of 210 patients.\nFollowing interim analysis (Jan 2007) the primary outcome was revised to be median GOS-E with a sample size of 150 required to detect a difference of 1.5 between groups via ordinal logistic regression. This was done to allow the study to be completed in a shorter timeframe\nWritten informed consent from NOK\n\n\nSetting\n\n15 ICUs in Australia, New Zealand, and Saudi Arabia\n\nAll with advanced neurosurgical management capabilities\n\n\nDec 2002 \u2013 April 2010\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nSevere, non-penetrating TBI\n\nDefined as either GCS 3-8 (post-resuscitation or pre-intubation), or\nMarshall Class III injury on CT imaging\n\n\n< 72 hours from injury\n\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nNot deemed suitable for full active treatment\nDilated, unreactive pupils\nMass lesions (unless too small to require surgery)\nSpinal cord injury\nArrest at scene\nICP controlled\n\n\n3478 patients with TBI assessed for eligibility:\n\n3302 excluded\n\nMajority due to exclusion criteria\n344 other\n21 additionally declined consent\n\n\n155 randomised\n\n73 allocated to craniectomy\n82 allocated to standard care\n\n\n\n\nBaseline characteristics\nVery similar between the two groups, except for pupil reactivity (comparing craniectomy vs standard care group):\n\nMedian age: 23.7 vs 24.6\nMale: 81% vs 74%\nClinical parameters prior to randomisation\n\nMedian SBP 135.4 vs 135.7\nHypotension 33% vs 30%\nHypoxaemia 25% vs 29%\n\n\nNeurological status\n\nMedian GCS: 5 vs 6\nMedian motor score: 3 vs 3\nBilateral unreactive pupils: 27% vs 12%\n\n\nInjury severity\n\nMedian Injury Severity Score: 33 vs 32\nMarshall class II: 23% vs 33%\nMarshall class III or IV: 73% vs 65%\nMarshall class VI: 4% vs 2%\n\n\nMechanism of injury\n\nMVA/MBA: 64% vs 68%\nBicycle accident: 6% vs 2%\nPedestrian accident: 7% vs 5%\nOther: 23% vs 25%\n\n\nMedian time from injury to hospital: 1 hour vs 1.2 hours\nMedian time from injury to randomisation: 35.2 hours vs 34.8 hours\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nDecompressive craniectomy plus standard care\nStandardised surgical approach:\n\nLarge bifrontotemporoparietal craniectomy with bilateral dural opening. The sagittal sinus and falx cerebri were not divided.\n\n\n\nControl\n\nStandard care based on BTF guidelines\nProtocol allowed lifesaving decompressive craniectomy after 72 hours from admission\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll patients had ICP monitoring (either EVD or parenchymal catheter)\nTreatment whenever ICP >20mmHg\nFirst tier interventions included:\n\nSedation optimisation\nPaCO2 normalisation\nMannitol\nHypertonic saline\nNeuromuscular blockade\nExternal ventricular drainage\n\n\nSecond tier interventions for refractory raised ICP included:\n\nMild hypothermia (35\u00b0C)\nBarbiturates\n\n\nSecond tier interventions could be used following randomisation in the surgical group\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nMedian Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) at 6 months\n\n3 (craniectomy) vs 4 (standard care)\n\nOR 1.84 (95% CI 1.05-3.24), p=0.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nProportion of unfavourable outcomes (GOS-E 1-4) at 6 months\n\n70% (craniectomy) vs 51% (standard care),\n\nOR 2.21 (95% CI 1.14 \u2013 4.26), p=0.02\n\n\n\n\nMortality\n\n19% vs 18%\n\n\nIntracranial pressure\n\nMean ICP after randomisation: 14.4mmHg vs 19.1mmHg, p<0.001\nHours with ICP >20mmHg: 9.2 vs 30.0, p<0.001\nAs a result, the surgical group required significantly less first and second tier medical interventions post randomisation\n\n\nDuration of hospital intervention\n\nDays of mechanical ventilation: 11 vs 15, p<0.001\nDays in ICU: 13 vs 18, p<0.001\nDays in hospital 28 vs 37, p=0.82\n\n\n\n\nSubgroup Analyses\n\nAdjusted comparisons for age, baseline GCS, motor score and Marshall score did not demonstrate any significant difference in results for GOS-E and unfavourable outcome\nPost hoc adjustment for pupil reactivity meant the difference in functional outcomes were no longer statistically significant:\n\nGOS-E score: adjusted OR 1.53 (95% CI 0.86 \u2013 2.73), p=0.15\nUnfavourable outcome: adjusted OR 1.90 (95% CI 0.95 \u2013 3.79), p=0.07\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn adults with severe diffuse traumatic brain injury and refractory intracranial hypertension, early bifrontotemporoparietal decompressive craniectomy decreased intracranial pressure and the length of stay in the ICU but was associated with more unfavourable outcomes at 6 months\n\nStrengths\n\nLarge, randomised controlled trial across 15 ICUs in 3 countries\nNo patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn consent\n96% of patients received assigned treatment following randomisation\n\n3 patients (4%) of intervention group did not receive craniectomy, 2 due to stabilisation of ICPs and 1 due to incorrect randomisation\n\n\nStandardised protocol for medical management which was consistent across sites and was based on Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines\nGOS-E is a well validated tool for assessing functional status following brain injury\n\nWeaknesses\n\nTreatment teams unable to be blinded to group assignment due to nature of neurosurgical procedure\nOver a third of patients were recruited from one centre (and 88% of patients were from Australia or New Zealand)\nLong recruitment period of 8 years\nSome clinicians suggest the cut-off of ICP >20mmHg for 15 mins is too low/early to trigger surgical intervention\nHypothermia to 35\u00b0C (which is now thought to be potentially harmful) was able to be used as a second-tier intervention, however its use was not reported\nPrimary outcome changed midway through trial\n\nHowever both outcomes were reported and both statistically significant at the end of the trial\n\n\nDifference in pupil reactivity at baseline is a potential confounding factor and adjusted outcomes were no longer statistically significant\nThere was crossover from the standard group to the craniectomy group:\n\nCrossover was allowed >72 hours is still considered salvageable and had an uncontrollable ICP despite thiopentone infusion\nNearly 1/4 of patients crossed over:\n\n5% of control group received craniectomy prior to 72 hours\n18% of the standard care group underwent decompressive craniectomy after 72 hours as a life-saving procedure\nThis may be why there is no mortality difference between groups\n\n\n\n\n56 out of 70 craniectomy patients underwent cranioplasty within 6 months which may have had additional complications contributing to 6 month functional outcomes\n\nOverall complications between the two groups were similar\n\n\nThis trial specifically assessed bifrontotemporoparietal without division of the falx cerebri. Other surgical techniques may have more favourable outcomes and/or less complications\nPatients with mass lesions were excluded from the trial and therefore the results cannot be generalised to this population\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn patients with diffuse TBI, early bifrontotemporoparietal decompressive craniectomy effectively reduced ICP but did not improve functional outcomes.\nWhile I will continue to seek neurosurgical intervention for patients with mass lesions, the decision to proceed to decompressive craniectomy in patients with diffuse TBI is less clear and with the increased chance of poor functional outcomes, patient values and other individual circumstances need to be considered\n\nWhat research has been published since this trial?\n\nWithin this trial patients were randomised to receive early decompressive craniectomy\nSubsequently, the RESCUEicp which was published in 2016 performed decompressive craniectomy as a last tier intervention\nThere have been no other multi-centre randomised control trials looking at decompressive craniectomy in diffuse TBI\nIn patients with traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage the STITCH trauma was published in 2015\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] Decompressive Craniectomy in Diffuse Traumatic Brain Injury\n[Editorial] Clinical Value of Decompressive Craniectomy\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Eliza Mason\nSummary date: 1st April 2022\nPeer-review editor: George Walker / Alastair Brown\nPicture by: Unsplash / Buddhi Kumar Shrestha\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
