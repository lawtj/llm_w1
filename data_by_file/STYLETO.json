ICM 20201; doi.org/10.1007/s00134-021-06417-y\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill adults, does the use of an intubating stylet compared to tracheal tube alone, increase first-attempt successful intubation?\n\nBackground\n\nAcute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation is one of the leading causes of ICU admission\nIntubation in the ICU setting has a higher complication rate compared to the operating theatre\nVarious devices and strategies have been developed with varying success, complication and adoption rates\nThe use of a preformed stylet has been proposed to increase first-attempt success rate\nPrevious trial comparing bougie and stylet in the ED setting showed a higher 1st attempt intubation rate in the bougie group\n\nDesign\n\nUnblinded, parallel-group, pragmatic randomised controlled trial\nPower calculations determined that a sample size of 1040 patients would provide 95% power to detect a 10% absolute difference between tracheal tube alone and stylet group with a type 1 error of 5% ; assuming 10% missing data\nCentral randomisation in 1:1 ratio in blocks of variable sizes\n\nTreatment assignments were concealed from patients, research staff and the statistician\n\n\nThe primary outcome was the proportion of patients with successful first-attempt intubation\n\nSuccess was defined by the presence of normal waveform capnography trace over 4 or more breaths (or in absence of capnography tube position was confirmed by auscultation of lungs and over stomach)\n\n\nThe pre-specified secondary outcome was the proportion of patients who had at least one complication related to tracheal intubation (occurring within 1 hour of intubation):\n\nHypoxia (Sats < 80% during intubation attempts)\nCardiovascular collapse (sBP < 65 mmHg recorded at least once; sBP < 90 mmHg that lasted 30 mins despite up to 1L fluid loading; required use of vasoactive drugs; cardiac arrest)\nDeath\nOperator-assessed difficult intubation\nOesophageal intubation\nOperator-reported aspiration\nArrhythmia\nAgitation\n\n\nSerious Adverse Events reported included:\n\nMucosal bleeding\nLaryngeal, tracheal, mediastinal or oesophageal injuries\nLowest peripheral oxygen saturation\nHighest FiO2\nHighest PEEP in the first 6 \u2013 24hrs post-intubation\n\n\nClinical outcomes (in addition to above)\n\nICU length of stay\nICU-free days within 1st 28-days post-intubation\nInvasive ventilator-free days within 1st 28-days post-intubation\n28-day mortality\n90-day mortality\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n32 ICUs in France\nBetween October 2019 and March 2020\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\nAbove 18 years of age\nCovered by public health insurance\nRequired emergency mechanical ventilation through tracheal tube on the ICU\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nIntubation following cardiac arrest\nPrevious intubation on the ICU during same admission with prior inclusion in the study\nPregnant or breastfeeding woman\n\n\n1626 screened who met inclusion criteria, 1040 randomised; 41 did not complete trial\n501 in stylet group, 498 in control group included in final analysis with no protocol deviation\nNo significant difference in baseline or airway characteristics between groups\n\nStylet group had a higher prevalence of low risk MACOCHA score (77.1% vs 75.2%)\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n1st intubation attempt with a tracheal tube and a stylet with a bend angle of 25 to 35 degrees at the distal tip\n\nControl\n\n1st intubation attempt with tracheal tube alone\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nAll other aspects of patient care during and after intubation was at the discretion of attending physicians\nMontpellier intubation protocol was recommended\nOperator characteristics (supplementary material)\n\nHigher proportion of senior anaesthetist in stylet group (13.4% vs 9.0%)\nHigher proportion of anaesthetic nurse in control group (5.1% vs 2.2%)\n\n\nDrug used for intubation\n\nHigher proportion of ketamine use in stylet group (72.2% vs 65.5%)\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Higher incidence of successful first-attempt intubation in stylet group compared to control (78.2% vs 71.5%. p=0.01)\n\nPredefined subgroup (including operator factors) analysis did not modify this outcome\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nComparing stylet vs. control group\n\nNo significant difference in complication rates\n\n38.7% vs 40.2%, p=0.64\n\n\nNo significant difference in serious adverse events\n\n4.0% vs 3.6%, p=0.76\n\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nSafety outcomes\nTraumatic injuries\nClinical outcomes including length of stay and mortality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn this multicentre, randomised trial involving critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation, the use of a stylet for tracheal intubation was safe and\u00a0 resulted in significantly higher first-attempt intubation success than the use of a tracheal tube alone.\n\nStrengths\n\nPrepublished trial protocol\nWell conducted trial attempting to answer a relevant question with regards to airway management practice\nInclusion criteria (with few exclusion criteria) reflective of ICU practice and hence likely to be generalisable\nGood balance of patients from all 32 sites that were involved in randomisation\nResults similar from previous studies (such as INTUBE) regarding rates of first pass success in ICU intubations\nNO protocol violations\nPredefined subgroup analysis of primary outcome included relevant factors\nSecondary outcomes were relevant\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDid not achieve recruitment target although the actual 1st attempt success rate in control group was as expected\nNo blinding of the intervention was possible\nFirst pass success was primarily defined by capnography trace, yet only ~85% in each group used capnography. The proportion using capnography seems dangerously low for what should be mandated monitoring for all intubations within ICU\nSome adverse events (difficulty, injuries) were operator reported \u2013 this could result in underreporting\nManagement of everything else pre, during and after intubation was at discretion of treating teams. It could be argued this is a bigger determinant of risk for adverse events happening (e.g. choice of drugs used) as opposed to the use of a stylet or not\nIn both groups approximately 58% of intubations were done by anaesthetists \u2013 this is not reflective of practice in all ICUs\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSuccessful intubation is the final outcome of a series of complex interactions between operator and devices used which are continually evolving\nThe rate of successful 1st attempt success is surprisingly low\nInterestingly, the experience of the operator did not affect the primary outcome\nMy current practice is to use a bougie in both direct and video-laryngoscopy with a low threshold for stylet in video-laryngoscopy depending on the view/situation\n\nExternal Links\n\nEffect of the use of an endotracheal tube and stylet versus an endotracheal tube alone on first\u2011attempt intubation success: a multicentre, randomised clinical trial in 999 patients\nEditorial\nESICM Podcast with Samir Jaber\nINTUBE Study\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Adrian Wong\nSummary date: 2nd June 2021\nPeer-review editor: George Walker\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
