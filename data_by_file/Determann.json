Critical Care 2010; 14:R1.\nClinical Question\n\nIn mechanically ventilated patients\u00a0without\u00a0acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress (ALI/ARDS), does lower tidal volume ventilation at 6 ml/kg (Vt-low), compared to conventional tidal volume ventilation at 10 ml/kg (Vt-high), reduce cytokine levels associated with lung injury?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised, controlled trial\nUnblinded (clinicians and researchers aware of allocation)\nSealed, opaque envelopes concealed group allocation\nBlock randomisation in sizes of 50 stratified by research site\nIntention-to-treat statistical analysis\nInterim safety analysis of secondary outcome data, by blinded independent clinicians\nPower calculation based upon data from similar trial in patients\u00a0with\u00a0ALI/ARDS\n\nExpected baseline IL-6 level of 250 pg/ml\nPowered to detect difference of 100 pg/ml at 80%\nTwo-sided significance level of 0.05\n49 patients required, but quadrupled to target of 200 after best guess difference between \u201cwith ALI/ARDS\u201d and \u201cwithout ALI/ARDS\u201d populations\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nTwo Dutch mixed medical / surgical ICUs (one \u2018academic\u2019 and one \u2018regional teaching hospital\u2019)\nJanuary 2005 to December 2007 (prior to Berlin definition of ARDS)\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: no diagnosis of ALI / ARDS; anticipated need for mechanical ventilation of more than 72 hours.\nExclusion: under 18 years of age; pregnancy; uncontrolled raised intracranial pressure; COPD or restrictive lung disease; on immunosuppressive drugs (up to 100mg hydrocortisone equivalent was allowed); pulmonary embolism; previous operative lung volume reduction.\n347 eligible patients, 195 (56% excluded, of which: 48% met criterial, 48 refused consent, 4% clinician\u2019s discretion), 152 randomised and 150 included in analysis.\nIntervention group were younger and more commonly smokers. Other demographics were comparably similar:\n\nAge: Vt-low 63 (SD\u00a0\u00b115) vs Vt-high 58 (SD\u00a0\u00b117); p=0.06\nSmoker: Vt-low 76% vs Vt-high 61%; p=0.04\nIn both groups, around half of patients included were admitted because of \u2018cardiac arrest\u2019 or \u2018neurologic disease\u2019\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nVt-low: Volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) at 6 ml/kg predicted body weight\n\nAllowed to increase to 7 or 8 ml/kg if severe dyspnoea\nAchieved 6.4 ml/kg (SD\u00a0\u00b11.0)\nMean Pmax 21.6 cmH2O (SD\u00a0\u00b17.0)\n\n\n\nControl\n\nVt-high: Volume-controlled ventilation at 10 ml/kg predicted body weight\n\nAchieved 10.0 ml/kg (SD\u00a0\u00b11.0)\nMean Pmax 24.6 cm H2O (SD\u00a0\u00b16.7)\n\n\n\nCommon management of both groups\n\n\nTrial of pressure-supported ventilation (PSV) three times daily\n\nContinued on PSV if tolerated, at discretion of attending clinician\nPressure adjusted to meet allocated target tidal volume\nIf attending clinician preferred PSV over VCV, above target tidal volumes were allowed, but patient remained in allocated group for statistical analysis\n\n\nPEEP and FiO2 were adjusted according to local protocol (not provided)\nWeaning from ventilator occurred when standard parameters were met\nExtubation was at the attending clinician\u2019s discretion\nIf re-intubated within 28-days, patient continued in trial in allocated group\nIf ALI/ARDS was diagnosed, ventilation reduced to 6 ml/kg for control group in keeping with best evidence practice\nAlternate day bronchoscopy performed for lavage and analysis of cytokines, paired with serum analysis\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nBronchial lavage cytokines: baseline TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were comparably similar and did not become significantly different between the two groups\n\nExact number not provided. Graphically represented in paper.\n\n\nPlasma cytokines: baseline IL-6 were comparably similar, both groups decreased over time, and the Vt-low group fell statistically significantly lower\n\nBaseline: Vt-low 51 ng/ml vs Vt-high 50 ng/ml; p=0.74\nDay-4: Vt-low 11 ng/ml vs Vt-high 21 ng/ml; p=0.01\n\n\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\nDevelopment of lung injury\nTrial was halted at interim analysis due to statistically significant difference in ALI/ARDS incidence\n\nVt-low n=2 (2.6%) vs Vt-high n=10 (13.5%); p=0.01\nOdds ratio for developing ALI/ARDS is 5.1 for Vt-high compared with Vt-low\n\n\n\n\nTertiary data:\n\nDay-7 ventilation of survivors: Vt-low n=9 (17%) vs Vt-high n=13 (25%); p=0.31\nMedian 28-day ventilator-free-days: Vt-low 24 days vs Vt-high 28 days; p=0.88\n28-day mortality: Vt-low n=24 (32%) vs Vt-high n=23 (31%); p=0.94\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nThe data suggests that mechanical ventilation with tidal volumes of 10 ml/kg is associated with sustained plasma cytokine release and contributes to development of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome\n\nStrengths\n\nGiven that many institutions have adopted Vt-low as a normal preventative ventilation strategy, (based on\u00a0ARDSnet\u00a0study and non-ARDS observational data) it is important that this clinical question is asked. This RCT is a good attempt to find supportive / refuting data.\nAttempt to overcome unblinded methodology by objective biochemical primary outcome\nSecondary outcome analysis by blinded clinicians\nStrict intention-to-treat analysis\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDefinition of ALI/ARDS in this trial pre-dates Berlin criteria that are used now\nPowered for non-clinically meaningful outcome\nLack of blinding and significant \u201cclinician\u2019s discretion\u201d management may have introduced bias but it is unclear the bias effect size and predominant direction of this\nInterim safety analysis of the secondary outcome was not initially planned and was therefore not statistically anticipated in power calculation. It was insisted upon by one of the institution\u2019s clinicians, as they suspected a significant difference between the groups. Early stopping tends to exaggerate effect, and may have led to an early false conclusion. The authors suggest that given the secondary outcome significance was p=0.01, this is unlikely (i.e. it was strongly significant difference). This is a significant weakness of the study, and some commentators have suggested it was not necessary (see links below).\nOnly recruited in two Dutch ICUs with local (and unavailable) protocols\nOver 3 years, these two ICUs only identified 347 eligible patients (adults with >3 days mechanical ventilation). This appears lower than expected. No details on screening criteria (consecutive, in-hours only, etc?). How many patients weren\u2019t included that could have been? Selection bias may have been present, but the data are not presented to be certain.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis intriguing and important clinical question is not sufficiently answered by this study, but it provides a suggestion that preventative lower tidal volume ventilation is best clinical practice.\nFurther larger trials are required if clinicians feel equipoise still exists.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Ventilation with lower tidal volumes as compared with conventional tidal volumes for patients without acute lung injury: a preventive randomized controlled trial by Determine et al\n[commentary]\u00a0Is acute respiratory distress syndrome an iatrogenic disease? by Villar and Slutsky\n[review]\u00a0Protective mechanical ventilation in the non-injured lung: review and meta-analysis by Sutherasan et al\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@DuncanChambler\nSummary date: 6th March 2015\nPeer-review editor: @stevemathieu75\n\n\n\n"
