There was significantly more hypotension and electrolyte disturbances in the intensive therapy group. Therefore the standard treatment should be the less intensive strategy.\nHowever, observational studies have shown that the target dose of RRT achieved is <70% (SCCM) compared with 110% in this study and therefore you may want to target a higher dose in order to achieve the doses given in the less intensive group.\n\n\n\nExternal Links\n\n[open access pdf of article]\u00a0Intensity of Renal Support in Critically Ill Patients with Acute Kidney Injury\n[Further reading]\u00a0SCCM Providing Kidney Support in the ICU\n[Further reading]\u00a0Cambridge Medicine Intensity of Renal Replacement Therapy\n[Further reading]\u00a0Portsmouth ICU Renal Handbook\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@davidslessor\nSummary date: 22th September 2014\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n"
