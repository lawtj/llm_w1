AJRCM 2018; 197[E Pub ahead of Print] DOI: 10.1164/rccm.201710-1995OC\nClinical Question\n\nIn delirium free critically ill adult patients receiving sedation, does the addition of nocturnal low dose dexmedetomidine prevent delirium and improve sleep?\n\nBackground\n\nDelirium in critically ill adults independently predicts longer hospital stay, higher costs and mortality\nNo pharmacological agent has been shown to prevent or treat delirium in critically ill adults\nThe pathophysiology of ICU delirium remains poorly understood\nThe data for dexmedetomidine does not support it\u2019s routine use for sedation. Trials have shown it to be non-inferior to midazolam and propofol (MIDEX-PRODEX) for time at target RASS score but improved cooperation and communication (subjective secondary outcome). In terms of delirium reduction, some studies support it\u2019s use and others show no meaningful patient centred outcome difference compared to alternative agents (DESIRE,\u00a0DahLIA,\u00a0Xian-Su)\nThis study assesses whether low-dose nocturnal dexmedetomidine infusions would prevent delirium and improve sleep during the ICU admission\n\nDesign\n\nTwo centre, double-blinded, placebo controlled randomized trial\nRegistered with Clinical Trials.gov (NCT01791296)\nConsecutive eligible patients\nComputer generated randomization sequence using permuted blocks of 4\nStudy drugs prepared in pharmacy in identical looking 50 ml bags\nParticipants, clinicians and all study personnel blinded to treatment assignment\nDue to the lack of pre-existing similar studies and wide variability in the reported incidence of delirium, a sample size calculation was not done. Instead a convenience sample of 100 patients were enrolled\nSignificance set at 0.05\nIntention to treat analysis\n\nSetting\n\n2 centres \u2013 16 bed ICU in Canada, 10 bed ICU USA\nFebruary 2013-January 2016\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria\n\nAdults admitted to intensive care\nExpected to require 48 hours or more of ICU care\nReceiving intermittent or continuous sedation (midazolam, lorazepam or propofol)\n\n\nExclusion criteria\n\nPresence of delirium (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist Score >/=4)\nHistory of irreversible brain disease consistent with severe dementia\nPresence of a primary neurological condition or neurological injury\nAcute alcohol withdrawal requiring treatment with benzodiazepines\nInability to speak English or French\nHistory of hepatic encephalopathy or end stage liver disease (Childs-Pugh Class B or C)\nHeart rate </=50 beats per min or 2nd or 3rd degree heart block in the absence of a pacemaker\nExpected death within 24 hours\nCurrent treatment with dexmedetomidine or clonidine\nInability to obtain informed consent\nPregnancy\n\n\n375 patients screened, 110 eligible for inclusion, 100 enrolled, 50 randomized to the intervention arm, 50 randomized to the control arm, 100 analysed\n\nBaseline characteristics (selected):Intervention v Control\n\nAge (years): 62 v 62\nMale gender: 31 v 33\nAPACHE II score: 23.6 v 21.9\nMechanically ventilated: 45 v 44\nDays in ICU before enrolment: 2 v 1\nDelirium risk score: 54 v 51\nContinuous IV fentanyl: 36 v 44\nRASS >/=0: 31 v 21\nRASS <0: 19 v 29\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nDexmedetomidine 0.1-0.7 mcg/kg/hr, by nocturnal intravenous infusion from 21:30 to 06:15 hours\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo 0.1-0.7 mcg/kg/hr, by nocturnal intravenous infusion from 21:30 to 06:15 hours\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nStudy drug infusion regimen\n\nStarted at 0.2 mcg/kg/hr at 21:30 hours with target RASS -1\nIf the RASS score was >/=0 then study drug was increased by 0.1 mcg/kg /hr every 15 minutes to achieve target RASS\nMaximum infusion rate 0.7mcg/kg /hr\nIf the RASS score was </=2 the study drug was decreased by 0.1 mcg/kg /hr every 15 minutes to achieve target RASS\nInfusion rate was halved at 06:00 hours and discontinued at 06:15 hours\nOn subsequent nights, the infusion was commenced at 21:30 hours at the same rate as the preceding morning\nStudy medication was administered nightly until either ICU discharge or adverse events occurred requiring the medication to be stopped\n\n\nAdditional medication\n\nPrior to starting the study drug infusion, all current sedative dosages\nwere reduced by 50%\nScheduled medications prescribed solely with the intention of improving sleep (e.g. melatonin, trazadone) were discontinued\nAdministration of all opioids, oral benzodiazepines, acetaminophen and non steroidal anti-inflammatories were not changed\nAgitation was treated with as needed intravenous midazolam (1-5 mg iv q 1 hrly) while the study drug was titrated upwards by 0.1 mcg/kg/hr every 15 minutes\nConcurrent sedative dosages were only increased above the 50% dosage if the RASS was >/=2 despite reaching the maximum study drug infusion rate and the maximum as needed dosage of midazolam\nAcute pain was treated with as needed fentanyl (25-100mcg q 1 hrly)\nAntipsychotic medication was permitted at the clinician\u2019s discretion for delirium management, if required\n\n\nAdditional supportive management\n\nAll ventilated patients were placed on AC (assist control), PC (pressure control or PAV (proportional assist ventilation)\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: Proportion of patients who remained free of delirium during their ICU admission was significantly greater in the intervention versus the control group\n\nAbsolute Risk (AR) = 40/50 (80%) v 27/50 (54%)\nRelative Risk (RR) = 0.44 (95% CI 0.23-0.88), p = 0.006\nFragility Index = 4\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nSignificant difference in number of ICU days free of delirium\n\nmedian [IQR] 8[4,11] v 6[2,12], p=<0.001\n\n\nNo significant difference in:\n\nduration of delirium until resolution for at least 12 hours\nsleep quality as measured by the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (administered each morning at 9:00 hours if the patient had a RASS >/=-1 and did not have delirium)\n\n\n\n\nPost-hoc analyses:\n\nSignificance difference in:\n\nSteroid usage: 22/50(44) v 8/20(16), p = 0.02\nPropofol dosage (mcg/kg/min): 22.6 v 34.9, p < 0.0001\nProportion of total study days with coma: 70/580 v 103/53;

patient reported sleep quality appears unchanged\n\nStrengths\n\nClinically relevant outcomes\nBoth centres had a well established delirium assessment practices in place before the study commenced\nGood baseline similarity between the groups\nRobust measures were used to ensure randomization, allocation concealment and blinding of participants and study personnel\nClearly reported measures to ensure equality of ancillary sedation and ventilatory treatments between the groups\nIntention to treat analysis\nNo losses to follow up\nSought and reported important adverse events\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRisk of imprecise effect estimate\n\nSmall number of participants and small number of total events (67 delirium free days in total)\nLikely underpowered \u2013 lack of sample size calculation together with small number of participants enrolled, increasing the risk of overestimation of the effect estimate and reducing the positive predicative value of the results\nMultiple outcomes measured (several post hoc) without a report of adequate statistical adjustment for multiple data testing, increasing the risk of false positive results\n\n\nRisk of performance bias\n\nStudy was conducted over a three-year period, during which time personnel, practices and adherence to trial protocol standards may have varied in their application and consistency\n\n\nRisk of detection bias\n\nTiming and frequency of delirium assessments were likely inconsistent as patients were \u2018evaluated for delirium at least once during a 12 hour time period\u2019 implying that some patients may have been evaluated more than once and some may have been evaluated during the evening time when the risk delirium was greater, introducing the possibility of an unequal distribution of confounding factors influencing both delirium risk and detection\n\n\nLimited external validity\n\nOnly 26% of screened patients were enrolled due to reasonable but restrictive exclusion criteria\nOnly two center\u2019s participated limiting the degree to which results can be extrapolated to other center\u2019s\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe reported results of this study are promising but are limited by risks of imprecision and bias and restricted external validity\nWith increasing age and comorbidity of critically ill patients we can anticipate a greater incidence of delirium, underscoring the need for larger well powered studies investigating the role of dexmedetomidine\nI will continue to use dexmedetomidine for short periods in those with or at particularly high risk of delirium but will await the results of larger studies before using it routinely and regularly for delirium prevention\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Low-dose Nocturnal Dexmedetomidine Prevents ICU Delirium: A Randomized, Placebo-controlled Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0Sedation and Delirium in the Intensive Care Unit ,NEJM\n[further reading]\u00a0Dexmedetomidine and Delirium in the ICU, ATM\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Imelda Galvin\nSummary date: 19th March 2018\nPeer-review editor: Steve Mathieu\n\n\n"
