Lancet; Epub Ahead of Print. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with severe COVID-19, does intravenous remdesivir, compared with placebo, improve the time to clinical improvement?\n\nBackground\n\nDespite the ongoing research efforts to find a treatment for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, there are currently no proven therapies shown to be safe and effective\nThe identification of a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 would be a turning point in medicine\nPrior investigations into the use of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir did not demonstrate efficacy\nRemdesivir, a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models\n\nDesign\n\nInvestigator-initiated, individually randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial\nPatients were randomly assigned (2:1) to either remdesivir or placebo\n\nBlock randomization stratified on basis of respiratory support:\n\n1: no oxygen support or oxygen support with nasal duct or mask\n2: high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, invasive ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation\n\n\n\n\nThe primary efficacy analysis was done on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis with all randomly assigned patients\nRegistered with clinicaltrials.gov\nTrial stopped early on the basis of the termination criteria specified in the protocol being met and the control of the outbreak in Wuhan\nThe original design required a total of 325 events across both groups to provide 80% power, to detect a change in time to clinical improvement of 6 days, assuming that time to clinical improvement was 21 days on placebo\n\nThe actual enrollment saw 236 participants, reducing the statistical power from 80% to 58%\n\n\n\nSetting\n\nTen hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei, China\nStudy conducted from Feb 6, 2020 to March 12, 2020\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: Men and non-pregnant women with COVID-19\n\nAt least 18 years old\nRT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2\nPneumonia confirmed by chest imaging\nOxygen saturation of 94% or lower on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of <= 300 mm Hg\nWithin 12 days of symptom onset\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nPregnancy or breast feeding\nHepatic cirrhosis\nAST or ALT\u00a0 more than five times the upper limit of\nnormal\nKnown severe renal impairment\n\nEstimated GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2\nReceipt of CRRT, HD, or PD\n\n\nPossibility of transfer to a non-study hospital within 72 h\nEnrollment into an investigational treatment study for COVID-19 in the 30 days before screening\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics of remdesivir (n=158) vs. placebo group (n=78)\n\nAge: 66 vs. 64\nMale: 56% vs. 65%\nCo-morbidities\n\nHypertension: 46% vs. 38%\nDiabetes: 25%

infusions\n\n\n\nControl\n\nPlacebo\n\nPlacebo infusions for a total of 10 days, matching the volume of the intravenous remdesivir infusions\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nOther treatments including lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon alfa-2b, vasopressors, antibiotics, and corticosteroids were allowed\nDaily monitoring for adverse events, clinical laboratory testing (days 1, 3,\n7, and 10), 12-lead electrocardiogram (days 1 and 14), and daily vital signs measurements\nNasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, expectorated sputa as available, and fecal or anal swab specimens were collected on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 for viral RNA detection and quantification\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nTime to clinical improvement within 28 days after randomization \u2013 no

did not provide significant clinical or antiviral effects in seriously ill patients with COVID-19. However, we could not exclude clinically meaningful differences and saw numerical reductions in some clinical parameters.\u201d\n\nStrengths\n\nIntention-to-treat design using all randomly assigned patients\nUse of placebo\nMulti-centre\nRelatively large enrollment and well-designed trial in an area with a significant number of COVID-19 cases\n\nWeaknesses\n\nTerminated early after stringent measures in Wuhan led to a decline in the number of patients presenting with COVID-19\nPower was not met; the lower enrollment reduced statistical power from 80% to 58%\n\nThis exposes the study to increased Type II error (falsely negative results)\n\n\nThe median time to treatment with remdesivir was 10 days; this may be outside of the window of opportunity to benefit from the drug\n\nThe authors state that they were unable to adequately assess whether earlier remdesivir treatment might have provided clinical benefit\nLimited hospital bed availability prevented admission earlier in disease progression\nThe lack of impact on viral load may suggest that remdesivir was administered too late in the disease progression\n\n\nLopinavir\u2013ritonavir was co-administered in 42 (18%) patients at baseline, however a previous study did not demonstrate lopinavir-ritonavir to be effective in patients with COVID-19 thus this may not have had a substantial confounding effect\nAbsence of data on infectious virus recovery or on possible emergence of reduced susceptibility to remdesivir\nMost patients were in category 3 of the six-point ordinal scale of clinical status at baseline\n\nIs this the patient population most likely to benefit from remdesivir?\n\n\n\u201cThe frequent use of corticosteroids in our patient group might have promoted viral replication, as observed in SARS and MERS, although these studies only reported prolongation of the detection of viral RNA, not infectious virus\u201d\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA relatively large but underpowered trial failed to demonstrate efficacy with intravenous remdesivir when administered relatively late in disease progression for COVID-19\nViral load was not shown to be diminished in clinical practice despite preliminary data\n\nExternal Links\n\nArticle: Wang et al.
