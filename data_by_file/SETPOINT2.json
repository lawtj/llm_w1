JAMA 2022; doi:10.1001/jama.2022.4798\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with severe stroke does early (\u22645 days of intubation) tracheostomy when compared to standard timing (from day 10) of tracheostomy improve functional outcome at 6 months?\n\nBackground\n\nTRACMAN was one of the largest multi-centre RCTs looking at timing of tracheostomy in ICU\n\nThe results did not provide any evidence supporting early tracheostomy\nThe number of patients with a primary neurological reason for ICU admission were low (~5%) within this trial\n\n\nRates of tracheostomy have been shown to be higher in those with acute brain injury compared to the general ICU population\nConcerns around weak cough, impaired swallow or an inability to maintain a patent upper airway often delay extubation in this population\nThe SETPOINT trial looked at the timing of tracheostomy in stroke patients\n\nThis small pilot RCT of 60 patients found no difference in ICU LOS (the primary outcome) but did show a lower ICU mortality (a secondary outcome)\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nInvestigator initiated, multi-centre, randomised trial\nBlinding of outcome assessors (long term functional and cause of mortality)\nOutcomes assessed using pre-structured telephone interview\nInformed consent by patient or their legally authorised representative prior to day 4 of intubation\nRandomised in 1:1 ratio\n\nCentral web-based tool\nBlocks stratified in groups of 4 to achieve equal group size per centre\n\n\nOnly centres with routine use of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) were recruited\nSample sized based on pilot trial\n\n15% increase from 30% to 45% in intervention group\nWith 80% power and alpha of 0.05 and 15% drop out rate a sample size of 380 (190 per group was required)\n\n\nPre-specified subgroups\nConfidence intervals for secondary end-points and subgroups not adjusted for multiplicity\n\nThus, these can only be interpreted as exploratory\n\n\nMissing values for mRS at 6 months handled by a multiple imputation approach\nAppropriate ethical approval\nRegistered with Clinical Trials\n\nSetting\n\n26 neurocritical care units in Germany and USA\nJuly 2015 \u2013 August 2020\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion:\n\n18 years or older\nInvasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)\nAcute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) or sub arachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) (all non traumatic)\nSETscore > 10\n\nPredicts the need for IMV for at least 2 weeks\nCalculated on day of enrolment\n\n\nClinical judgement of treating neuro-intensivist that tracheostomy likely to be needed\nPrinciple indication for tracheostomy had to be at least one of:\n\nOngoing demand for suctioning secretions\nCNS related respiratory insufficiency\naspiration or danger of aspiration due to dysphagia\n\n\n\n\nExclusion:\n\nmRS > 1 (pre-morbid)\nIMV > 4 days\nClinical conditions prohibiting early tracheostomy or mandating surgical tracheostomy\nPregnancy\nLife expectancy < 3 weeks\nAnticipated withdrawal of life sustaining therapies\nInability to obtain informed consent\nParticipation in other interventional trial\n\n\n4562 assessed for eligibility \u2013> 4180 excluded for not meeting eligibility criteria\n\n188 randomised to early tracheostomy \u2013> 177 had tracheostomy (95.2%)\n\n177 in primary analysis as 9 lost to follow up and 2 withdrew consent\n\n\n194 randomised to late tracheostomy \u2013> 130 had tracheostomy (67%)\n\n189 in primary analysis as 4 lost to follow up and 1 withdrew consent\n\n\n\n\nComparing baseline characteristics (early vs.

adverse events (up to 2 hours post tracheostomy): 15.8%\nAny serious adverse event:\n\n47.3% vs 43.8%\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nIn patients with severe stroke receiving IMV, early tracheostomy did not improve rate of survival without significant disability at 6 months compared to standard timing\nClinically relevant benefit or harm can not be excluded due to wide confidence intervals\n\nStrengths\n\nMulti centre RCT across 2 countries increase external validity\nAlthough 4130 were excluded, an accurate screening log minimises selection bias and shows that a majority were excluded for valid reasons (not meeting inclusion criteria or meeting exclusion criteria)\n\nOnly 1.3% (n=55) were excluded for \u201cother\u201d reasons\n\n\nAnalysed on intention to treat basis\nBalanced baseline characteristics\nAchieved a meaningful separation in timing of tracheostomy\nGood adherence to protocol \u2013 no violations reported\nMinimal loss to follow up (3.4%)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe primary outcome of an mRS of 0-4 ranges from no disability to moderate severe disability that requires the assistance of others for mobility and daily needs\n\nThis is a very wide range of functional outcomes. One wonders if a patient who has an mRS of 4 would view this as a \u201cbetter\u201d functional outcome?\n\n\nSecondary end-points regarding ICU medications were defined post-hoc\nUnderstandably unable to blind clinicians and patients\nNo standardised weaning protocol used\n48.7% of all randomisations came from 4 centres (2 in USA, 2 in Germany)\n33% of standard tracheostomy group did not receive a tracheostomy\n\n22% were extubated and 11% died prior\nThis confirms prior studies about the utility of the SETscore and its ability to predict those that will be extubated successfully in the short term\nHowever, over 1 in 5 patients did not have a procedure that had a near 20% complication rate\n\n\nAIS, ICH and SAH may have different clinical courses\n\nICH may have worse functional prognosis than AIS in retrospective studies\n\n\nThis appeared to be a cohort that had a poor prognosis (evidenced by high decompressive craniectomy rates, and high WFNS scores)\n\nThis is also evident in the fact that only ~10% in each group had a mRS of 0-2\nWould a difference be shown if the cohort was less likely to have an unfavourable outcome?\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis trial provides no evidence that in patients with severe stroke an early tracheostomy is better than standard time for tracheostomy, and that an early tracheostomy may mean a patient has to undergo a procedure that they did not need\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article] SETPOINT2\n[further reading]\u00a0Early vs Late Tracheostomy in ICU patients: a meta analysis of randomised controlled trials\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: George Walker @hgmwalker89\nSummary date: 13th May 2022\nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\nPicture by: iStock\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
