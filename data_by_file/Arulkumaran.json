J.Anaesth.\u00a0(2016)\u00a0doi:\u00a010.1093/bja/aew398\u00a0First published online:\u00a0December 7, 2016\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients who are unplanned admissions to critical care, does the day and time of admission to critical care influence acute hospital mortality?\n\nBackground\n\nCritically ill patients may present at any time of day, thus critical care unit staffing levels and resources should be adequate throughout a 24 h period, weekends, and holidays\nIt is imperative to ascertain whether out-of-hours services are adequate to cover emergency care without any adverse impact on outcome for patients\n\nDesign\n\nRetrospective cohort study\nData collected from UK Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) Case Mix Programme (CMP) database \u2013 a mandatory national audit collecting data on admissions and outcomes in all critical care units in the UK\nSpecialist units (neuro, cardiac) and standalone HDUs excluded\nEach day divided into \u201croutine hours\u201d (0800-1759) and \u201cout of hours\u201d (1800-0759)\nAny missing physiological data presumed normal\nPotential confounders identified a priori and adjusted for in analysis:\n\nAge\nSevere conditions in past medical history\nPrior functional dependency\nNumber of days from hospital admission to critical care admission\nlocation before admission\nCPR in 24 hours prior to critical care admission\nPrimary reason of admission to critical care\nAcute severity of illness score (ICNARC and APACHE scores used)\n\n\nStatistical Analysis:\n3 multilevel logistic regression models used:\n\nUnadjusted with single covariant of day/time of admission\nAdjusted model adjusting for key potential confounders:\nAdjusted model including delay/no delay covariate\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n216 General/mixed Intensive Care Units in the UK that submitted data for the ICNARC CMP\nApril 1 2013-March 31st 2015\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusions:\n\nAge >16\nUnplanned ICU admission\n\n\nExclusions:\n\nPlanned ICU admission (including post theatre, transfers and repatriation)\nReadmissions \u2013 only the first episode was counted\nOrgan donation\nMissing data (primary outcome or key confounders)\n\n\n300,469 admission screened, 195,428 included in final analysis\nBaseline characteristics:\n\nmean age of patients admitted was 60 yr\nmean APACHE II score of 17\nApproximately one-quarter of patients had some degree of prior dependency\nOverall, 4% of patients received in-hospital CPR during the 24\u2009h before admission and a further 4% had out-of-hospital CPR\nThe greatest proportion of patients was admitted with a primary respiratory pathology (25.5% of all admissions)\nNo significant differences between the two cohorts seen in any of the major criteria, including age, severity of illness, and co-morbidities\n\n\n\nWeekend days cohort\n\nDay of admission analysis: Patients admitted on Saturday or Sunday\nTime of admission analysis: During routine working hours (0800-1759) and out of (1800 0759)\n\nWeek days cohort\n\nDay of admission analysis: Patients admitted on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday\nTime of admission analysis: During routine working hours (0800-1759) and out of (1800 0759)\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome:\n\nTotal ICU mortality: 18.8%\nTotal hospital mortality: 26.6%\nUsing Monday as reference day, no significant difference seen between odds of admission out of hours or at a weekend in adjusted analysis (P value =0.61)\n\n\nSecondary outcome:\n\n8,295 (4.2%) patients experienced a delay\u00a0(documented decision to admit to time of admission) of at least 1 hour prior to admission to ICU. 2,097 (1.1%) had delay >4hrs\n\nBoth groups associated with an increased risk of death (OR 1.08 for < 4hrs, 1.17 for >4 hrs, P=0.04)\nAdjusting to account for delay did not change lack of effect of day/time of admission\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nAfter risk adjustment using detailed clinical data, there was no difference in acute hospital mortality for unplanned admissions to ICU between weekdays and weekends, or daytime and nighttime\nA small proportion of patients experienced delays in admission to ICU and this was associated with an increased risk of death\n\nStrengths\n\nImportant clinical question\nLarge detailed database with very little missing data\nMulti centre\nDetailed risk adjusted analysis performed, with confounders identified a priori\nSecondary analysis also an important clinical question\nRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov\n\nWeaknesses\n\nStudy design can only demonstrate association, and not causation\nSignificant heterogeneity exists between size and staffing of units in the ICNARC CMP \u2013 this would affect the internal validity of the data\nDoes \u201cdelayed admission\u201d include transport time, or time spent in radiology?\n\u201cDelayed admission\u201d is a complex entity which may or may not include delays in treatment \u2013 this could not be commented on in the study\nIt may be the effect of delayed admission was actually a delay in getting essential treatments (antibiotics, cardiovascular resuscitation etc)\nLimited external validity \u2013 this study may not be relevant to non-UK institutions, with different staffing and bed availability\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis article did not show an association between date and time of admission and increased mortality, but showed an association between delayed admission to ICU and increased mortality\nI will try to ensure that patients who require critical care receive the appropriate treatment in the appropriate place as soon as possible\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Association between day and time of admission to critical care and acute hospital outcome for
