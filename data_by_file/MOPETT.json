American Journal of Cardiology: 2013; 111(2)273-277.\nClinical Question\n\nIn patients with moderate Pulmonary Embolism (PE), does low dose thrombolysis\u00a0+ anticoagulation, compared with anticoagulation alone, reduce pulmonary artery pressure at 28 months?\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nPatients and clinicians non-blinded\nBlinding of cardiologists who determined result of primary outcome\nPowered at 90% to detect 10% reduction in pulmonary artery pressure with 5% accepted alpha error if 110 patients randomised. Aimed to recruit 120 to allow for attrition.\n\nSetting\n\nSingle centre, USA\n2008 \u2013 2010\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion: signs and symptoms suggestive of PE, with confirmatory imaging (CT or V/Q)\n\nmoderate PE defined if above criteria met and either of the following:\n\nCT-PA involvement of >70% involvement of thrombus in\u00a0\u00a0\u22652 lobar or left or right\u00a0main pulmonary arteries\nhigh-probability V/Q scan showing V/Q mismatch in\u00a0\u22652 lobes\n\n\n\n\nExclusion: onset of symptoms >10 days, >8 hours since start of parenteral anticoagulation, BP<95 or\u00a0\u2265200/100, contraindication to thrombolysis\n121 patients randomised\n\nIntervention\n\ntPA and enoxaparin\n\ntPA\n\nif\u00a0\u2265 50kg: 10mg bolus, followed by 40mg within 2 hours (half standard dose)\n<50kg: total dose 0.5mg/kg with 10mg bolus with remainder within 2 hours\n\n\nEnoxaparin 1mg/kg SC BD, (maximum dose 80mg) or unfractionated heparin (70units/kg bolus up to maximum 6,000 units, followed by infusion 10units/kg/hr up to maximum 1000 units/hr. At 3 hours after termination of thrombolysis infusion increased to 18units/kg/hr. Target APTR 1.5-2.\n\n\n\nControl\n\nEnoxaparin alone\n\n1mg/kg SC BD or unfractionated heparin 80 units/kg bolus followed by 18 units/kg/hr with target APTR 1.5-2.\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nEnoxaparin was the preferred heparinoid in both groups, however unfractionated heparin was used if there was evidence of renal failure or for patient preference.\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcome: development of pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure\u00a0\u2265 40mmHg) as assessed by ECHO at 28 months\n\n16% in treatment group vs. 57% in control group, P<0.001, NNT 2.5\nmean PASP at 28 months 28 vs. 43mmHg, P<0.001\n\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\ncomposite endpoint of pulmonary hypertension and recurrent PE at 28 months\n\n16% in treatment group vs. 63% in control group, P<0.001\n\n\nRecurrent PE\n\n0% vs. 5%, P=0.08\n\n\nMortality\n\n1.6% vs. 5%, P=0.3\n\n\nTotal mortality\u00a0+ recurrent PE\n\n1.6% vs. 10%, P=0.049\n\n\nBleeding\n\n0% vs. 0%\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\u2019 Conclusions\n\nLow dose thrombolysis is safe and effective in the treatment of moderate PE\n\nStrengths\n\nRandomised trial\nBlinding of cardiologists who performed ECHO determining result of primary outcome\nStandard method for determining pulmonary artery pressure\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSingle centre\nPatients and clinicians non-blinded\nAuthors stated that their second primary outcome was the composite endpoint of pulmonary hypertension and recurrent PE but the study did not perform a power calculation for this\nSmall sample size. Underpowered to determine differences in mortality\nConfidence intervals not reported\nOlder definition of \u2018sub-massive\u2019 using anatomical rather than functional criteria. Only 21% of patients had RV enlargement and 6% had RV hypokinesia which are criteria used in most \u00a0definitions of submassive PE. The included population may therefore be a lower-risk cohort than other trials investigating \u2018intermediate-risk\u2019 PEs.\nTrial was not registered on clinicaltrials.gov\nTarget APTR for control group was lower than in other trials. Were they under-treated?\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe addition of low dose thrombolysis in moderate PE decreased pulmonary artery systolic pressure by an average of 15mmHg at 28 months. Other studies will need to tell us if this is clinically relevant. A larger study is also required to determine if this benefit is offset by the potential risks from thrombolysis.\n\nLinks\n\nFull text only available with subscription\nabstract\u00a0\ndoi: 10.1016/j.amjcard.2012.09.27\n\nEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\nEMCrit\nLife in the Fast Lane\n\nMetadata\nSummary author:\u00a0@DavidSlessor\nSummary date: 26 June 2014\nPeer-review editor: @DuncanChambler\n\n\n"
