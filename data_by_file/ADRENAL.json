Adverse events were low, but significantly increased in the hydrocortisone group\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Adjunctive Glucocorticoid Therapy in Patients with Septic Shock\n[further watching]\u00a0Critical Care Reviews: Live Presentation of Trial Results\n[further reading]\u00a0TBL: Steroids in Sepsis\n[further Listening]\u00a0EMCrit: Steroids for septic shock pre-adrenal\n[further reading]\u00a0Study Protocol\n\nMetadata\nSummary author: Dave Slessor and Steve Mathieu\nSummary date: 20/01/2018\nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n\n"
