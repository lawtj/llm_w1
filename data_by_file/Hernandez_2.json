JAMA 2016;316(15):1565-1574. doi:10.1001/jama.2016.14194\nClinical Question\n\nIn critically ill patients who are at high risk for re-intubation, is high flow nasal oxygen non-inferior to non-invasive ventilation in reducing re-intubation and post-extubation respiratory failure?\n\nBackground\n\nHernandez has previously demonstrated that in low risk patients the risk of re-intubation can be decreased with the use of high-flow nasal oxygen post-exubation\nNava\u00a0and Ferrer\u00a0reported that in high risk patients, the use of\u00a0post extubation non-invasive ventilation can reduce re-intubation rates and respiratory failure\nThis trial was designed to determine if high flow nasal oxygen was non-inferior to non-invasive ventilation at reducing re-intubation and post-extubation respiratory failure in high risk patients.\n\nDesign\n\nRandomised controlled trial\nRandom number generator through telephone call centre\nNon-inferiority study\nNon-blinded\nInvestigators excluded from clinical decisions\nSample size calculation: 600 patients required to give 80% power to allow a non-inferiority margin of 10% for the high flow group, assuming baseline re-intubaton rate of 20-25% for each therapy and allowing for a patient loss rate of 15%\nPer-protocol and intention to treat analysis performed for primary outcome\n\nSetting\n\n3 Intensive Care Units, Spain\nData collected: September 2012-October 2014\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion criteria: Received mechanical ventilation for >12 hours and ready for planned extubation with at least 1 of following risk-risk factors for re-intubation:\n\n>65 years\nAPACHE II >12 on extubation day\nBMI >30\nInadequate secretions management\nDifficult or prolonged weaning\n>1 co-morbidity\nHeart Failure as primary indication for mechanical ventilation\nModerate/severe COPD\nAirway patency problems\nMechanical ventilation > 7 days\n\n\nExclusion criteria: Do-not-resuscitate orders, tracheostomies, hypercapnia during spontaneous breathing trial, accidental extubation, self extubation\n1211 patients met inclusion criteria of whom 604 randomised\nComparing baseline characteristics of non-invasive groups vs. high flow nasal group\n\nAge: 64.4 vs. 64.6\nAPACHE II (median)\n\nOn admission: 16 vs. 16\nAt extubation: 10 vs. 11\n\n\nLength of mechanical ventilation before extubation (median): 4 vs. 4 days\nHigh-risk factors for re-intubation\n\nAge >65 years: 58% vs. 57%\nHeart failure as primary indication for ventilation: 9.9% vs. 5.5%\nCOPD: 20.7% vs. 17.6%\nAPACHE II >12 on extubation day: 40.8% vs. 45.2%\nProlonged mechanical ventilation: 38.2% vs. 34.8%\n\n\nDiagnosis at admission\n\nSurgical: 33.4% vs. 43.8%\nTrauma: 10.5% vs. 6.6%\nMedical: 59.2% vs. 53.1%\n\nPrimary respiratory failure: 38.5% vs. 33.8%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nHigh-flow nasal oxygen\n\nFlow initially set at 10l/min and titrated upwards until experienced discomfort\nTemp initially set at 37C\nFiO2 adjusted to target SpO2 >92%\nRescue therapy with NIV not allowed\n\n\n\nControl\n\nNon-invasive ventilation (NIV)\n\nFull face-mask NIV (Respironics)\nPEEP and inspiratory pressure support adjusted to target RR 25/min, SpO2 92% and pH 7.35\nSedatives to increase tolerance to NIV were not allowed\nTotal time patients received NIV was 14 hours (IQR 8-23)\n\n\n\nManagement common to both groups\n\nPre-defined weaning protocol, extubation and re-intubation criteria\nAimed to continue high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy or NIV for 24 hours post extubation\n\nOutcome\n\nPrimary outcomes: (Comparing NIV with high flow nasal oxygen)\n\nRe-intubation within 72 hours \u2013 high flow nasal oxygen was non-inferior\n\n19.1% vs. 22.8% (risk difference -3.7%;

A\u00a0larger trial would be required to determine non-inferiority at a lower threshold\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis randomised controlled trial demonstrated that in patients that are high risk for re-intubation the use of high flow nasal oxygen was non-inferior to non-invasive ventilation\nThe non-inferiority margin was set at 10% which means that clinically significant differences may have not been detected with this study\nPost-extubation respiratory failure was significantly more common in the NIV group, however \u201crespiratory failure\u201d included subjective measurements \u2013 this result should be treated with caution\nIn patients that are high risk for re-intubation I will use non-invasive ventilation, and if this not tolerated then change to high flow nasal oxygen\n\nExternal Links\n\n[article]\u00a0Effect of Postextubation High-Flow Nasal Cannula vs Noninvasive Ventilation on Reintubation and Postextubation Respiratory Failure in High-Risk Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial\n[further reading]\u00a0Effect of Postextubation High-Flow Nasal Cannula vs Conventional Oxygen Therapy on Reintubation in Low-Risk Patients.
